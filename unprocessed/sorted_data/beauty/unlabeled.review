I think that this product does what it promises to do.  It is a "freshen-up" mist.  I use it everymorning (I shower before bed) before I blowdry my hair and it creates volume and makes my hair look awesome!  It is only short of the full 5 stars because it does not last all day, but it is definitely good for a few hours.  Even after it wears off, my hair is not flat.  It still has enough texture that I can just put my hands through it to get the "messy" look.

I don't think that it smells bad.  The smell actually reminds me of some spa products taht I use

What is wrong with everyone reviewing these products?  This is for your HAIR and SCALP, not the face.  Again, after experimenting a few times, if it doesn't work, just say so and state the facts, not hype and your feelings for Jonathan and his show on television

This is a great idea for a product! For those of you who don't wash your hair every day, this is a great way to keep it looking and smelling fresh on days you don't wash it. I used this after 5 days without washing, and while it might have worked better within 3 or 4 days, it still freshened my hair and made it beautiful! Well done

I moved to an area with city water (which I was not used to), not too long ago.  I noticed that my hair and skin seemed to turn dull and gray after some time.  No matter what hair and skin products I tried using, the result was the same.  After reading about this product in a health magazine, I decided to give it a shot since it received such high praise.  I am thrilled with my purchase!  I saw almost instant results.  My skin has never felt softer.  The filter system itself was very easy to install and required no tools.  For anyone with harsh, chlorine laden city water, I highly recommend this product

I purchased a Beauty Water Shower Purification System and have used it about 5 times now with fantastic results. I have very hard water in my home and am tired of constantly having to blow dry my hair or having to use tons of products for it to be manageable and not frizzy.  My hair felt very soft and manageable using this product and I am hoping it helps my highlights last longer.  I did not experience that 'slimy' feeling people usually associate with soft water.  I'm even able to let my hair air dry and not be frizzy with this product.  I am curious to see how long this filter lasts.  I called Jonathan Products and was told that they do have a replacement filter that costs $55 so you can save a bit of money when you need to replace the filter

I watched Blow Out and figured the product was flying off the shelves because of the show's popularity.  I ordered some because the ingredients sounded nice, plus he did seem sincere when formulating, etc.  I have blonde hair, color treated, thick, long lengths.  I've bought high-end hair products for 20 yrs from beauty salons and stores and have never used anything that made my hair feel like Jonathan Product.  You can immediately tell it's stripping and cleansing your hair.  Then, the conditioner,  with it's exotic fragrance,  is the most wonderful conditioning treatment I've ever used.  My hair looks cleaner and has more body than ever before with just shampoo &amp; conditioner.  I'll use it as long as it's available to me

Some highlights are the all day long hold, ease of use, resistance to moisture (rain won't ruin your hair), low shine, strong yet natural hold, and good smell (which is rare).

I've used numerous hair products before but now, this is the only one I ever consider using

I am a big fan of this product.  My hair is very strong.  It needs a product which can keep it tamed.  However, most products that have that level of strength also come with high sheen or gloss which, in my opinion, is a bad look for today's fashions.  The matte look is more flexible.  American Crew Fiber gives me pliability and a matte look with a very strong hold.  It also smells nice.... not to strong and not too girly

I have been using this product for over 5 years as an alternative to gel or bed head.  The results are great. No unwated shine, no gooiness, very easy to wash off. 
Your hair wont feel stiff and wont get damaged. Reasonably priced and more available every day.

This is a great product for getting the bed head look.  I can use approximately a dime size worth in my palms and go wild!  Trust me, the results are great.  If you apply too much, you're hair will get oily. The good thing is that this product washes out easily with any Shampoo

Well I am very impressed with this.  I also have tried so many different shampoos and this is one of the best, if not the best, I've used.  I say that because whether I straighten my hair or leave it curly, this shampoo makes it feel and look and smell great.  It feels so nice and clean.  I don't rinse twice with this because it's unnessesary.  
I tried this because of watching Blow Out and on my last trip to America I bought a couple of bottles.  It's one of the best purchases I made.  Most girls buy shampoos etc based on packaging and smell and let me tell you, not only does it look and smell great, but what it does for your hair is amazing and apparently it's very low in damaging chemicals.  I won't hesitate to buy more of Jonathan's products next time I go.  I love this and can't say enough about it

I got a sample of this conditioner when I bought a similar product by another company.  I didn't care for the one I purchased, but the sample was awesome and I am going to buy the Jonathan conditioner.  I have always had fine limp hair and tried lots of volume products.  I used this for a week and this is the only thing I have ever seen any kind of difference with.  I love it!

After reading the other reviews I was a little worried about using the product I had already ordered.  After using it for a few days now my hair has never looked better, I truly feel like this shampoo/conditioner was meant for me.  I have fine, super straight hair, middle to short.  It feels clean and sleek. The conditioner smells like pina coloda, yum!  I would definatly recommend this for my hair type.  Would maybe recommend to lather the shampoo in your hands first then work thoroughly( it doesn't lather as well as some shampoos that have lots of glycerine in them) and only apply the conditioner towards the end of your hair and leave in for a few min.  Hope that helps

This is the second product of Jonathan's I've used and I'm equally happy with it.  I have thin hair when it's straight, and something in the middle when it's curly.  Either way, I'd like it thicker, and this foam certainly helps.  It's great and I've found it does what it promises.  It smells good and you don't need to use too much.  It feels nice in my hair and the fragrance lasts most of the day.  It doesn't matter if your hair is curly or straight, hopefully you will find this as effective and as helpful as I have

I heard about Jonathan products from watching QVC. I was a bit skeptical at first about buying his products because the price was a bit high.  I usually use Paul Mitchell or Matrix products.  Well rest assured, this was the absolute best product I have ever used to create lots of volume in my hair. My hair is fine and straight with a little bit of natural wave in the back. Other products I used would create a little volume but this stuff really made a huge, visible difference.  My boyfriend also commented how thick my hair looked.  This goes on nice and light and the scent is terrific, not a heavy smell, a light fresh smell.  I highly recommend this product and will definitely buy it again.

I just had my fine, processed hair cut into a short layered wedge.  It was shoulder length before and I used a Revlon thermal-air styler to make it acceptable.  After using Dirt, I no longer have to spend ANY time styling it!!  I just blow dry, scrunching my hair with my fingers and when almost dry, I turn my head upside-down and apply about a dime size amount of Dirt into the roots. Flip up and I'm ready to go all in less than 3 minutes.  I find it important to rub Dirt between my palms to warm it up before applying.  Use a little first...you can always add more. It gave my hair great body and control. Hope this product works for you too

I'll admit, with a well receded hair line I still tried to get what's left to be manageable and look good - everything else I've used left my hair dry, flaked off or didn't hold.  Jonathan Dirt has solved this long-term issue for me in just the first few days of use.  Dirt provides the manageability, hold and look I've strived for and even smells great with its almond scent.  I recommend this without reservation

I love this product!  My mother is a hair dresser so I have tried every product there is, and this one is my favorite.  If you use it properly then it's amazing.  It's a texturizing paste, not super glue, you can't expect amazing hold out of it.  And because it is a PASTE, it's extremely thick so you only need a tiny amount.  I have short, thin, wavy hair that I flat iron, and I just rub my fingers along the top of the paste to just get a thin layer on the tips of my fingers and apply it to my roots, it works amazing for volume, and I've never had a problem with it weighing my hair down or looking greasy!

Don't expect miracles from this product.  It does exactly what it claims to do!  Plus, it smells amazing!  Oh, and also...I am NOT in love with Jonathan nor his TV show, I bought this product before I had even heard of him or his TV show...I honestly find him a little annoying, but this product definitely isn't

Dirt has proven to be an amazing product...I'm "wowed" with how great it works!  I have a layered, razor cut that flips out and, before, was using three other products (pomade-for shine, manipulator-for flip, and aquage paste-for volume).  I just received Dirt last week, and after putting on just a bit, got the look that I was wanting, without all the hassle of three different products.  Yes, it's a bit pricey but well worth it (considering you only have to use a little, you're sure to save $$$).  and the smell, ::sigh:: is so great!  (Even if it hadn't worked as great as it does, I think I would still purchase it just for the delicious scent)  :)  I love that I can run my fingers through my hair and it's soft and manageable, even at the end of the day, and without the sticky "gunk" feel.  I definitely plan on purchasing other Jonathan Products

Awesome product.  As an old product used to use the slogan "a little dab'l do ya", it is true with this product.  Don't over do it or you'll have a greasy mess.  Start with a little and add more if you need to.  Always melt by rubbing hands together first.  Smells great too!  My only beef is the price.  Most of us aren't used to paying those Rodeo Drive prices, Jonathan.  $26 may not be a lot to you, but....  :)

As a working mom in her mid-forties, I am ever hopeful when it comes to product claims of time savings and beauty enhancement.  And so, when I read about the T3 Tourmaline Ionic Hair Dryer, I just had to have one.  With a price tag of $200, I figured the claims just had to be true.

The T3 is a sleek, beautiful and lighweight hairdrying and styling tool.  With its ionic particle things, it sounds so scientific, too.  But does it do what it says it will do?

For me, it's hard to tell.  It does dry at least as fast as my old 1800 watt hair dryer but with seemingly less heat.  So arguably, it is faster.  Less heat also means less hair damage.  So arguably, that is a beauty enhancement.  Is my hair sleeker and shinier?  Again, hard to tell.  No one at the office the next day seemed to notice any change.

One thing that I do notice, however, is that I like the idea of using an ionic hair dryer.  For whatever reason, I do think it is good for my hair.  And I suppose that in and of itself is enough to make this purchase entirely worthwhile

I did not believe the hype but read the other reveiws.  I have long hair and it would normally take me 30 minutes to dry my hair with my $15 drug store purchased hair dryers...I was pretty much used to that.  Often times I would let my hair dry naturally rather than blow dry it because of the hassle and time - not because it looked better, it looked terrible.  This dryer dries my hair in 15 minutes (fully blown under and styled), on top of that my hair is shiny when it's done and not dry.  I just bought one for my mom and would recommend this blow dryer for anyone that normally spends more than 20 minutes drying their hair, you will absolutely cut the dry time 50%.  Great purchase!

I have long, thick, wavy hair that loves to frizz up.  I have tried every anti-frizz, hairstyling product out there, and they either didn't work or weighed my hair down.  I didn't want to like this hair dryer and was hoping it wouldn't live up to the hype... BUT, it's excellent on my hair.  After using the dryer (with no styling product) my hair was straight, shiny and felt great.  For me, it didn't change the amount of time I dried my hair, so if your considering buying it for speed, don't, unless you have thin or short hair.  Is it worth the $200.00 price tag?  Depends on you personally, but I recommend you shop around because there are better deals out there

I had stopped using a regular hair dryer a few of months ago as I felt that my hair was becoming brittle and looking damaged.  However air drying my hair seemed to take forever. It was then that I heard about the T3 tourmaline Professional Ionic Hair Dryer from my hairdresser.  Initially the $200 price tag did put me off and I pushed the idea aside. But somehow it remained somewhere in the corner of my mind and one fine day after getting late for a meeting yet again, I decided to bite the bullet and buy the hairdryer. 

And I tell you, I have never been happier using a hair dryer. My hair started looking better and less damaged in the first few weeks itself. It has become smooth and silky and has a healthy glow.  Though the weight and the time taken were almost similar to my old model, the after effect is worth the price paid. The product does come with a 4-year warranty which is an added advantage to justify the exorbitant price. Though the sales brochures uses a lot of scientific terms like ionic mineral and blah... blah... I am not going to bother about it much as far as my hair appears healthy and saves me time so that I don't have to deal with being late for meetings. I   recommend this product to all who would love to have a mane to be proud of

i hate blow dryers.  I never used on because they took too long, and my arm would get tired.
This dryer is incredible.  my hair was done in 15 minutes. I only have to go over each section once. I was truly amazed. It is worth every penny

I absolutely love this hairbrush! I have curly hair and like to blow it out often and until now I have not been impressed with any brushes. This brush holds the hair in pace when blowing dry and also lets you move it with your hair and dose not hurt as some can or get stuck. You will not be sorry if you are looking for the perfect brush to go with your perfect dryer (the featherweight)! Oh another thing I like is it extremely easy to keep clean.

Bazooka bubble gum with a touch of cinnamon. The sent/flavor is not too much. The gloss is not very hot, less than "venom" closer to "the balm" in hotness. I did't see any lip changes but I never do with any lip plumper glosses. The container is beautiful. Love the rollerball tip. This stuff brings me back to my 80's bonniebell days

As a lip gloss addict, I have easily over 200+ glosses. Too Faced Fat Kiss is by far one of my favorites. The superb shine makes my lips look so good! Although it doesn't really plump, it still tastes like cinnamon, and it will warm you up in winter. I have two different colors, because I like it so much! I strongly reccomend getting a couple, so you can keep them in your purse, make up bag, car...Everywhere! This rocks sooo much

The T3 Tourmaline Ceramic Iron is a wonderful product. Gets hot fast. Straightens and flattens my big curly hair with ease. Narrow so can get sideburns without fear. Terribly easy to use even for a novice like me.  Only problem, some gaps at top of straigtening area that catch stray hairs and usually pull them out. Luckily I have plenty of hair.

I have been using the volumizing shampoo and conditioner for 2 weeks.  I love this product!  No build up, No dandruf.  Make sure your hair is wet, not just damp, and you should not have a "lathering problem".  I purchased this from QVC and I will definately be a repeat customer.  I have short hair, so this will last me a while.  I loved it so much I bought some for my daughter.  This is my new shampoo

After reading the reviews of Jonathan's products, I wasn't completely sure I would like them, but wanted to try the shampoo, conditioner and Dirt after seeing him demonstrate Dirt on TV.  I have very fine, bodyless hair that is short and  high- and low-lighted.  I usually use Aquage products because they don't weight my hair down and especially  like the thickening spraygel for body.

Jonathan products smell great.  Additionally, I had no problem with the size of the bottles.  The quantity is probably the same as any other good product.  First the volumizing shampoo:  it lathered just fine and I used only a small amount.  I could feel the volumizing effect right after rinsing, after which I used the volumizing conditioner.  Again, no problem.  I decided to forego the thickening spraygel that I usually use in order to give Dirt an honest try.

I think I need a little more practice with this product since I am not a hairdresser.  I used the smallest amount and my hair was slightly damp.  I also need a haircut at the moment.  Next time I will put it on completely dry hair and apply it from the bottom going up and underneath.  It worked okay, but I need to get used to it.

Bottom line:  try it...you'll like it.  Sandra in Tuls

He said, "Your skin looks really nice." And he never notices anything! I told him it was makeup since he actually bought it for me at my request and I wanted him to know it was money well spent. I like to use it in conjunction with Benefit's Dandelion powder for a fresh, natural glow. I really do feel younger and prettier with it on, and I can't say that about many/any other comsetics I've tried. Totally worth it

BeneFit's "supermodel in a bottle" lives up to the hype. You only have to use a tiny bit of this in key places to attract light and create an ethereal glow... this is the perfect little potion to use when you really want to make an impact. It is a pearlized light pink that blends easy, stays put and adds a little drama. One of my all-time beauty favorites

High Beam is really pretty!  I love using it as a highlighter on my "big night outs".  I swipe it on my nose to make my nose seem slimmer, right above my blush on my cheeks, and above my eyebrows near the arches.  It really gives my skin a dewy and glowing look. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's very goopy and sticky.  It actually scared me a bit to put it on my face because the product is so thick that if you turn the jar upside-down, it won't run!  But overall, I still think this is a terrific product

I love the Benefit line, everything I have tried works great (not to mention they have great packaging and catchy names for all their products!). 

That said, High Beam is simply amazing. It only takes a little dab to add a nice glow/shimmer to my face. I especially like to use it on the cheek bones as it leaves a nice soft glow. High Beam works so much better for me than other products I've tried that either left my skin sticky or chalky. Not to mention those other products cost a lot more!

If you are looking for a little glow, a little shimmer, High Beam is the answer

I have used a similar product in a compact by Chanel and paid $50. It wasn't too long before I saw the end of it either. Now with Benenfit's High Beam I can get the effect for less than half the price so I'm a happy customer. I put this on my cheek bone and brush blush over it for glimmery, dewy cheeks. It's a very youthful look. It's not unnatural but it's better than natural. It's supernatural. Since I started wearing it people don't know exactly what I've added but they comment that my skin looks particuliarly good. You can control the highlighting effect by how much you use but I like to use a generous amount. My skin really does beam.

I recently discovered Benefit products. This is a great product if you want to add a little glow to your skin. I use it to highlight my cheek bones. You can use it any where you want a glance to linger. The best thing about this product is the smallest amount makes a big difference in your skin. I suggest you try this product. It works wonders.

I am a professional hairstylist and use this iron...I think it works the best, leaves the hair shiny and soft, however I have no idea why the company would recommend using it on wet hair, unless you want to spend all day doing your hair!  Dry your hair prior to using and get unbelievable results that last

This is by far the greatest thing I have ever seen.  I have struggled with curly/frizzy hair for 40 years.  I have tried all the serums, smoothers, and spent 30-40 minutes blowing out (15 with the iron once you get the feel for it), only to have it only last a day.  I use this with NO PRODUCT.  My hair is slick, smooth, silky (Jennifer Aniston-ish).  I put a bit of leave in conditioner just on the ends when I'm done.  Sleep on it, wake up ready to go...last several days.  P.S.  It's also muggy and humid here and it still looks great

Having wild and uncontrollable hair as a woman is a well-documented problem, but what about if you're a guy?  After years of using cheap gels that left flakey residues in my hair, and/or smelling feminine, I was introduced to American Crew in the little brown jar by a stylist.  I now swear by this stuff.  Even on my knappy head (I have very thick wavy, but not curly, hair) American Crew keeps my hair in place and natural-appearing without lookling like I'm using Brill's Cream.  A thick dime-sized dab is enough for keeping my short haired coiffure in place and de-poofed all day. The trick is to work it in while my hair is moist from the shower but not dripping wet. Yes, it costs way more than gels but it's worth every penny.  One 4 oz jar lasts me about 6 weeks. The other benefit to American Crew is the smell - my wife absolutely loves the way my hair smells

If Jonathan wants to sell environmentally concious products he should promote it in his other hairstyling products. The aquasana shower filter  is an excellent product which i use .Whats it matter who's name is on it. It is what it is and it will leave your skin and hair feeling fresher.

I moved to an area with city water (which I was not used to), not too long ago.  I noticed that my hair and skin seemed to turn dull and gray after some time.  No matter what hair and skin products I tried using, the result was the same.  After reading about this product in a health magazine, I decided to give it a shot since it received such high praise.  I am thrilled with my purchase!  I saw almost instant results.  My skin has never felt softer.  The filter system itself was very easy to install and required no tools.  For anyone with harsh, chlorine laden city water, I highly recommend this product

Well first off, I'm a guy with very short hair...so I don't know whether or not it really works. But I'm bored and decided to rate it anyway. So here goes:

Cons

Conditioner is really thick and difficult to get out of the bottle. The best solution for this is to let the bottle sit upside down. 

Pros

Smells DAMN good. I'm not a big fan of fruity/coconut aromas, but I like this particular smell so much that I might need to go to rehab sometime in the future. 


Bottom Line: Although this conditioner is difficult to get out of the bottle, it smells really good. Whether or not it will work for your hair, the only way to know is to try it. And even if ot doesn't work for your hair...it's worth the 20 bucks just to open it up and smell it every now and then. =)

Bazooka bubble gum with a touch of cinnamon. The sent/flavor is not too much. The gloss is not very hot, less than "venom" closer to "the balm" in hotness. I did't see any lip changes but I never do with any lip plumper glosses. The container is beautiful. Love the rollerball tip. This stuff brings me back to my 80's bonniebell days

This is absolutely the greatest shampoo ever! I've been abusing my hair for at least 30 years, and I have never had my hair looking and feeling as healthy as it does now. There is no better product for your hair on the market. All others are full of damaging detergents and chemicals with a dose of silicone thrown in to make you think your hair is clean, but you're killing it. I admire Jonathan for not treating us like idiots by being THE ONLY shampoo that doesn't tell you to lather, shampoo, and rinse twice, but you do need to. And you need to use no more than a dime-size amount of the Jonathan conditioner. My hair has never looked or felt so good

I heard about Jonathan products from watching QVC. I was a bit skeptical at first about buying his products because the price was a bit high.  I usually use Paul Mitchell or Matrix products.  Well rest assured, this was the absolute best product I have ever used to create lots of volume in my hair. My hair is fine and straight with a little bit of natural wave in the back. Other products I used would create a little volume but this stuff really made a huge, visible difference.  My boyfriend also commented how thick my hair looked.  This goes on nice and light and the scent is terrific, not a heavy smell, a light fresh smell.  I highly recommend this product and will definitely buy it again.

It's the best product I've used to create volume and hold.  I didn't notice it after blow drying, but, while using the curling iron and styling - my hair had a lot more volume and great hold.  I have straight, fine, limp hair and it is very difficult to get it to hold a style.  I truely noticed a big difference.  I plan to purchase the other volumizing products, once they are in stock.

The T3 Tourmaline Ceramic Iron is a wonderful product. Gets hot fast. Straightens and flattens my big curly hair with ease. Narrow so can get sideburns without fear. Terribly easy to use even for a novice like me.  Only problem, some gaps at top of straigtening area that catch stray hairs and usually pull them out. Luckily I have plenty of hair.

After reading the reviews of Jonathan's products, I wasn't completely sure I would like them, but wanted to try the shampoo, conditioner and Dirt after seeing him demonstrate Dirt on TV.  I have very fine, bodyless hair that is short and  high- and low-lighted.  I usually use Aquage products because they don't weight my hair down and especially  like the thickening spraygel for body.

Jonathan products smell great.  Additionally, I had no problem with the size of the bottles.  The quantity is probably the same as any other good product.  First the volumizing shampoo:  it lathered just fine and I used only a small amount.  I could feel the volumizing effect right after rinsing, after which I used the volumizing conditioner.  Again, no problem.  I decided to forego the thickening spraygel that I usually use in order to give Dirt an honest try.

I think I need a little more practice with this product since I am not a hairdresser.  I used the smallest amount and my hair was slightly damp.  I also need a haircut at the moment.  Next time I will put it on completely dry hair and apply it from the bottom going up and underneath.  It worked okay, but I need to get used to it.

Bottom line:  try it...you'll like it.  Sandra in Tuls

After watching Blow Out and seeing how passionate Jonathan was about his product, he sold me. Anyone who is that determined to make the best product on the market, obviously will do whatever it takes to make it happen.
After seeing how much the product was, I cringed at the fact that a bottle of shampoo would be that much. I later, literally dragged myself to Sephora to purchase this shampoo/conditioner after knowing that I was willing to take a risk that could eventually end up in my closet.
I bought it, went straight to my bathroom, and washed my hair. The shampoo did not lather, which I expected considering there is no harsh detergents or sodium lauryl sulfate. The conditioner was a very light, thin substance. Definitely not thick. 
Finale-Dried my hair, and right there, I knew that this product is definitely the BEST hair product BY FAR, that I have ever used. My hair, is very damaged, brittle and FULL of split ends. This product made my hair, very very full, FULL of shine, and very soft. My hair was beautiful for days....
Last test.. going to work. As soon as I put my hair down from a pony tail (I'm a waitress), INSTANTLY everyone noticed my hair. They asked "what did you do?? your hair is soo beautiful".. I told them "40 dollar shampoo and conditioner" WELL WORTH THE COST. Definitely a salon in a bottle. Now my worst fear is that it will be discontinued for any reason. And if so, I am willing spend 1k to stock up and save as much as I can. There is no other product like it

My hair will do anything I want with this shampoo and the volumizing conditioner, whether I'm in a dry climate or a humid one.  And the water in the city I'm in doesn't make a difference either.  I can't believe how great it is!!  It really is the best I've ever used

After reading the other reviews I was a little worried about using the product I had already ordered.  After using it for a few days now my hair has never looked better, I truly feel like this shampoo/conditioner was meant for me.  I have fine, super straight hair, middle to short.  It feels clean and sleek. The conditioner smells like pina coloda, yum!  I would definatly recommend this for my hair type.  Would maybe recommend to lather the shampoo in your hands first then work thoroughly( it doesn't lather as well as some shampoos that have lots of glycerine in them) and only apply the conditioner towards the end of your hair and leave in for a few min.  Hope that helps

I thought I was just going to have to put up with fly-away hair the rest of my life.  This product is not for baby fine hair that goes limp when anything touches it.  It's serious taming for seriously stubborn, coarse, or frizzy hair.  Mine falls into the first two categories.  Don't use too much!  I use it after I've dried some of the moisture out with light blow drying then gently sweep it through my hair - even combing it gently in to reach every strand.  For the first time in years my razor-cut layered hair is smooth

LIKE ANY OTHER LEAVE-in creme, conditioner, ANYTHING, if you PUT TOO MUCH OF IT ON, it WILL attract  DIRT.  I know this because I have baby fine hair and had to model in the DRY DRY deserts in the middle of summer.  Needed ANYTHING leave-in to keep my staticy hair down.  Yes, the more you use, to more dirty you get....  (but in photos you can't really see this, but it felt nasty!)    SO.  Wash your hair.   Well.  Condition.  Towel dry.  APPLY SPARINGLY.  Like a TOUCH.  And smooth into hair. It's not rocket science.  If you need a little more later, add a little more

He said, "Your skin looks really nice." And he never notices anything! I told him it was makeup since he actually bought it for me at my request and I wanted him to know it was money well spent. I like to use it in conjunction with Benefit's Dandelion powder for a fresh, natural glow. I really do feel younger and prettier with it on, and I can't say that about many/any other comsetics I've tried. Totally worth it

<review_text>
High Beam is a nice subtle highlighter. However, be sure to blend it very quickly and well or it will look unnatural in certain lighting (it'll look like you have pink nail polish on your face). It also has a tendency to emphasize pores. So only use it on areas of your face where you don't have any, like on the top of the cheek bone and under your eyebrows.

BeneFit's "supermodel in a bottle" lives up to the hype. You only have to use a tiny bit of this in key places to attract light and create an ethereal glow... this is the perfect little potion to use when you really want to make an impact. It is a pearlized light pink that blends easy, stays put and adds a little drama. One of my all-time beauty favorites

High Beam is really pretty!  I love using it as a highlighter on my "big night outs".  I swipe it on my nose to make my nose seem slimmer, right above my blush on my cheeks, and above my eyebrows near the arches.  It really gives my skin a dewy and glowing look. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's very goopy and sticky.  It actually scared me a bit to put it on my face because the product is so thick that if you turn the jar upside-down, it won't run!  But overall, I still think this is a terrific product

I have used a similar product in a compact by Chanel and paid $50. It wasn't too long before I saw the end of it either. Now with Benenfit's High Beam I can get the effect for less than half the price so I'm a happy customer. I put this on my cheek bone and brush blush over it for glimmery, dewy cheeks. It's a very youthful look. It's not unnatural but it's better than natural. It's supernatural. Since I started wearing it people don't know exactly what I've added but they comment that my skin looks particuliarly good. You can control the highlighting effect by how much you use but I like to use a generous amount. My skin really does beam.

Some highlights are the all day long hold, ease of use, resistance to moisture (rain won't ruin your hair), low shine, strong yet natural hold, and good smell (which is rare).

I've used numerous hair products before but now, this is the only one I ever consider using

I am a professional hairstylist and use this iron...I think it works the best, leaves the hair shiny and soft, however I have no idea why the company would recommend using it on wet hair, unless you want to spend all day doing your hair!  Dry your hair prior to using and get unbelievable results that last

This is by far the greatest thing I have ever seen.  I have struggled with curly/frizzy hair for 40 years.  I have tried all the serums, smoothers, and spent 30-40 minutes blowing out (15 with the iron once you get the feel for it), only to have it only last a day.  I use this with NO PRODUCT.  My hair is slick, smooth, silky (Jennifer Aniston-ish).  I put a bit of leave in conditioner just on the ends when I'm done.  Sleep on it, wake up ready to go...last several days.  P.S.  It's also muggy and humid here and it still looks great

I'll admit, with a well receded hair line I still tried to get what's left to be manageable and look good - everything else I've used left my hair dry, flaked off or didn't hold.  Jonathan Dirt has solved this long-term issue for me in just the first few days of use.  Dirt provides the manageability, hold and look I've strived for and even smells great with its almond scent.  I recommend this without reservation

I love this product!  My mother is a hair dresser so I have tried every product there is, and this one is my favorite.  If you use it properly then it's amazing.  It's a texturizing paste, not super glue, you can't expect amazing hold out of it.  And because it is a PASTE, it's extremely thick so you only need a tiny amount.  I have short, thin, wavy hair that I flat iron, and I just rub my fingers along the top of the paste to just get a thin layer on the tips of my fingers and apply it to my roots, it works amazing for volume, and I've never had a problem with it weighing my hair down or looking greasy!

Don't expect miracles from this product.  It does exactly what it claims to do!  Plus, it smells amazing!  Oh, and also...I am NOT in love with Jonathan nor his TV show, I bought this product before I had even heard of him or his TV show...I honestly find him a little annoying, but this product definitely isn't

Dirt has proven to be an amazing product...I'm "wowed" with how great it works!  I have a layered, razor cut that flips out and, before, was using three other products (pomade-for shine, manipulator-for flip, and aquage paste-for volume).  I just received Dirt last week, and after putting on just a bit, got the look that I was wanting, without all the hassle of three different products.  Yes, it's a bit pricey but well worth it (considering you only have to use a little, you're sure to save $$$).  and the smell, ::sigh:: is so great!  (Even if it hadn't worked as great as it does, I think I would still purchase it just for the delicious scent)  :)  I love that I can run my fingers through my hair and it's soft and manageable, even at the end of the day, and without the sticky "gunk" feel.  I definitely plan on purchasing other Jonathan Products

Awesome product.  As an old product used to use the slogan "a little dab'l do ya", it is true with this product.  Don't over do it or you'll have a greasy mess.  Start with a little and add more if you need to.  Always melt by rubbing hands together first.  Smells great too!  My only beef is the price.  Most of us aren't used to paying those Rodeo Drive prices, Jonathan.  $26 may not be a lot to you, but....  :)

Having wild and uncontrollable hair as a woman is a well-documented problem, but what about if you're a guy?  After years of using cheap gels that left flakey residues in my hair, and/or smelling feminine, I was introduced to American Crew in the little brown jar by a stylist.  I now swear by this stuff.  Even on my knappy head (I have very thick wavy, but not curly, hair) American Crew keeps my hair in place and natural-appearing without lookling like I'm using Brill's Cream.  A thick dime-sized dab is enough for keeping my short haired coiffure in place and de-poofed all day. The trick is to work it in while my hair is moist from the shower but not dripping wet. Yes, it costs way more than gels but it's worth every penny.  One 4 oz jar lasts me about 6 weeks. The other benefit to American Crew is the smell - my wife absolutely loves the way my hair smells

As a working mom in her mid-forties, I am ever hopeful when it comes to product claims of time savings and beauty enhancement.  And so, when I read about the T3 Tourmaline Ionic Hair Dryer, I just had to have one.  With a price tag of $200, I figured the claims just had to be true.

The T3 is a sleek, beautiful and lighweight hairdrying and styling tool.  With its ionic particle things, it sounds so scientific, too.  But does it do what it says it will do?

For me, it's hard to tell.  It does dry at least as fast as my old 1800 watt hair dryer but with seemingly less heat.  So arguably, it is faster.  Less heat also means less hair damage.  So arguably, that is a beauty enhancement.  Is my hair sleeker and shinier?  Again, hard to tell.  No one at the office the next day seemed to notice any change.

One thing that I do notice, however, is that I like the idea of using an ionic hair dryer.  For whatever reason, I do think it is good for my hair.  And I suppose that in and of itself is enough to make this purchase entirely worthwhile

I did not believe the hype but read the other reveiws.  I have long hair and it would normally take me 30 minutes to dry my hair with my $15 drug store purchased hair dryers...I was pretty much used to that.  Often times I would let my hair dry naturally rather than blow dry it because of the hassle and time - not because it looked better, it looked terrible.  This dryer dries my hair in 15 minutes (fully blown under and styled), on top of that my hair is shiny when it's done and not dry.  I just bought one for my mom and would recommend this blow dryer for anyone that normally spends more than 20 minutes drying their hair, you will absolutely cut the dry time 50%.  Great purchase!

i hate blow dryers.  I never used on because they took too long, and my arm would get tired.
This dryer is incredible.  my hair was done in 15 minutes. I only have to go over each section once. I was truly amazed. It is worth every penny

I think that this product does what it promises to do.  It is a "freshen-up" mist.  I use it everymorning (I shower before bed) before I blowdry my hair and it creates volume and makes my hair look awesome!  It is only short of the full 5 stars because it does not last all day, but it is definitely good for a few hours.  Even after it wears off, my hair is not flat.  It still has enough texture that I can just put my hands through it to get the "messy" look.

I don't think that it smells bad.  The smell actually reminds me of some spa products taht I use

After reading the other reviews I was a little worried about using the product I had already ordered.  After using it for a few days now my hair has never looked better, I truly feel like this shampoo/conditioner was meant for me.  I have fine, super straight hair, middle to short.  It feels clean and sleek. The conditioner smells like pina coloda, yum!  I would definatly recommend this for my hair type.  Would maybe recommend to lather the shampoo in your hands first then work thoroughly( it doesn't lather as well as some shampoos that have lots of glycerine in them) and only apply the conditioner towards the end of your hair and leave in for a few min.  Hope that helps

I'm at an age where wrinkles develop and would be a very unhappy camper without this night cream. Fortunately I started using it a few years ago and have not noticed new wrinkles. Since I'm buying into all the hype about vitamin C, I choose this particular formula. Besides the documented benefit of vitamin C this cream is great in general. I love the consistancy, rich but not too rich. And I don't get blemishes from it even though it contains shea butter, which gives it a fantastic feel. It is packed with other great ingredients like vitamins A, E and K and anti-oxidants like grapeseed extract. There is another skin care company that bases its whole line on grapeseed extract alone. It has phospholipids which binds water to the skin. Also anti-inflammatories like extract of orange, geranium and lavander. There's been recent research by those such as Dr. Perricone, for example, about the damage inflammation does to the whole body, the skin included. It really leaves the skin feeling soft and hydrated. It's nice to wake up in the morning to treated skin. I try new brands a lot but based on its track record I'm staying faithful to this night cream. It works

I purchased these gloves not for moisturizing my hands, but to protect them when I'm driving or riding my bike in the sun. My main concern was that they would be heavy or clumsy, but they fit like a second skin, are lightweight, grip well, and are extremely comfortable. I wear them for hours at a time without noticing I have them on, so I imagine they would be easy to sleep in. They wash like a dream. Will definitely buy  more

I added this item to qualify a gift order for supersaver shipping.  I was hesitant to order a scented candle on line, but I am glad I did.  I sent a book and this candle to a friend who was going to visit her husband who had been completing a fellowship in another city.  She really liked the scent--orange blossom green fig.  (I went to the Mistral site to read more detailed descriptions of the scents.)  She also liked the screw-on cap, which she thought would make it very secure in transit.  I would order this again.

I purchased the Andis clipper and trimmer combo offering.  My primary need was for a cordless clipper and Andis appeared to be about the only one available that  Icould find.  The purchase was a bit pricy but I'm totally happy with how they function.  The products are quality made and handle very nicely.  There is more power provided when the clippers are plugged in, but for my needs, real close cut every 2-3 days, they work perfect.  I recharge my clippers once a week.  The instructions suggest that every 60 days you let the clippers run until the battery runs out.  I did this once, but got tired of waiting for the clippers to stop, so my impression is that I could probably go for 2 weeks between charging the battery.  Overall I consider them to be a very nice set of clippers/trimmers

Exuding citrusy aromas, the Still Life Bath Bomb smells GLORIOUS. Bath Bombs are made of sodium bicarbonate, so they're like "alka seltzers" for the bath.

Some of the LUSH Bath Bombs contain petals and other plant parts and Still Life is no exception. Mine was FILLED with sunflower petals--even a complete flower and a leaf! 

Although bathing with such Bath Bombs are luxurious, the clean up can be quite messy. (When my husband came into the bathroom while I was bathing, he exclaimed "What the heck is THAT?!" Why, it's sunflower petals, my dear...)

I had a first rate mess on my hands after the bath. I had to keep clearing the drain for the water to go down. THEN I had to do it a few more times before I could finally RINSE the tub!

If you don't mind the LUSH Bath Bombs that include petals and other flora and fauna--and you love bright, citrusy scents--you'll likely LOVE Still Life Bath Bomb. It smells heavenly, and tints the water with a golden hue.

However, if you don't like plant parts floating in your bath--nor the clean up involved afterwards--steer clear of Still Life

to the bareMinerals starter kit ! Cute little jars allow you to try the Bisque and Summer Bisque Multi Tasking Face, I use both shades for concealers on all areas of my face.  I take my time and apply a little then go back and apply more if needed.  Being able to apply after the foundation works very, very well.  All blend together, no tell tale signs of "concealer".  My under eye area looks more natural as well, covering the dark circles and veins.

The bare Radiance All Over Face Color has too much shimmer for me so I gave that to my daughter.  But the Glee is perfect.  I use this in place of the Warmth and am happier with the color.  Just a different tone to use, especially if you already have a red/ruddy complexion.

Faux Tan All Over Face Color is something I plan on using this summer, perhaps mixing with Glee for a sun kissed look.

The brushes included with the kits, really are Strokes of genius and worth every penny!  I find no comparison to any other brushes (Mary Kay, Estee Lauder etc) that I own.

I am so glad that Amazon and Sephora offer a wide variety of bareEscentuals products. [...]

I've looked at this makeup for the 2 years I have been a Mary Kay consultant and I cannot believe how I love it!!!  Moisturize is the most important thing for your skin but I love the skin care of the easiness that is involved in looking and feeling great!  It really does what it says!

I have been using Strivectin for 2 1/2 years, faithfully every morning and evening.  The crease that was between my eyebrows is gone!  Also the "marionette" lines around my mouth have lessened quite a bit - also much less feathering of lipstick.  I only use it on my trouble spots, before applying moisturizer.  It's terrific.
And it lasts forever

There are so many products to choose from and I have tried many of them, most recently Rejuvinol and the other being AlphaDerma CE that just dried my skin and I ended up breaking out from them. It was horrible. someone at my office recommended Strivectin and I gave it a try. It not only completely cleared up my skin but got rid of my crows feet and forehead wrinkles. And to think, I've wasted soooooo much money on other products that didn't work!!

I'd like to start off by saying it's how it makes you feel and how long that feeling will last - not the person who put his/her name on it. Get over the hype and indulge yourself in this very pretty scent! It's truly a fun burst of many magnificent scents all blended together to form this cute, playful perfume. If you're looking for a light, flirtatious find - this is the perfume for you and I recommend it highly to the more than picky souls out there. My only concern is how long this lasts, as it tends to fade a little more than Britney's recent perfume, Fantasy - Otherwise, this will have your co-workers 'curious' as to what exactly you're sporting - It's definitetly worth it

When I first saw CURIOUS while on holiday, I bought it without trying any. I just wanted the pretty bottle. When I opened it up back home I didn't have high hopes, impulse buying rarely works out does it? So what did I think?

I love it. My first thought was; Sophisticated and classic. CURIOUS can be worn for work, shopping, evenings out - anywhere at any time! 

On the first spay you notice the top notes of magnolia and lotus flower, then the dreamy base of vanilla-infused musk, which lasts throughout the day. The best surprise of all?   After you've worn it for a few hours, you are surprised with the mouth-watering aroma of tangy pear.

All my life I looked for a liner that would last all day and not smudge.  I tried everything, from Chanel to Maybelline and nothing worked.  I don't like liquid liners because I find them hard to apply.  I found the answer to my problems with this gel eyeliner.  I found it much easier to apply than liquid eyeliner, and it lasts for ever!  I own it in 4 different colors and I don't think I'll ever stop using it.

This shaving cream was very enjoyable to use. You only need an amount the size of a nickel or quarter in your palm to get a good lather. I do not use the badger hair brush yet but my shave is very comfortable and it smells good. It also has made shaving a more enjoyable experience for me which is worth a few bucks right there ! I tried the T &amp; H West Indies Lime and the 1805 traveler size as well. The 1805 also smells good and the West Indies Lime had a bit of a musty, lime scent to it. You may want a more distinct lime scent but I have not tried any others with this smell.

I have been using soaps and creams for a few months now. I started to use soaps and creams mainly because they provide better value for the money and they help my sensitive skin.

I have always had sensitive skin and shaving never helped. I recently came across Truefitt &amp; Hill Trafalgar and figured that if it was good enough for royalty, then I should give it a try. I can definitely see why this is the official royal shaving cream. It wasn't until I tried this cream and combined it with a Merkur Futur double-edged razor and badger brush that I knew what it was to have a close shave with no razor burn.

Like the previous reviewer said, most people need to realize that very little goes a long way. With just a small dab on a wet badger brush you will be able to create a warm and thick lather that will make you love shaving.

Shaving the old fashioned way will take a bit longer, but it will feel luxurious and the results are much better than anything you can get with a Mach 3 and a can of gel. I can finally go a whole day without shaving. If I go two days, I have a nice 5 o'clock shadow around 8.

This is the best bet for a shave cream. It smells very good and provides more than enough lubrication for a razor to simply glide over. A badger brush is a must though. Truefitt &amp; Hill Trafalgar is simply fantastic.

I recently started wet shaving (within the last two months) and have come to regard shaving as something I look forward to now.  I use a Merkur Futura double-edged razor and have bought an assortment of different shaving creams to try, including Prorasso (italian eucalyptus stuff), Taylor of Bond Street (avocado) and the Truefitt &amp; Hill Traflagar.  My top choice is the Trufitt &amp; Hill hands down.

While many people might see the $22 as expensive, most people need to realize that a very little goes a long way.  This is not like the Edge Gel or Barbasol that you learned to shave with.  This just requires a dab on the wet brush (a real badger hair brush) and a swirl in a small bowl sitting in a a bit of hot drawn water to create a warm and thick lather that will make you enjoy shaving again.  I would estimate this jar will last about 6 months.

In looking at the cost of my new shave method (52 blades a year ($0.50 each), two jars of shaving cream a year ($22 each) comes to about $70 a year.  Compare this to a blade every other week and a can of alcohol-based shave gel (which dries your skin) every other month for a cost of $60.  Ten bucks more a year buys a much better shave.

I've noticed that my shaves take a bit longer, but my skin has cleared up of many of the bumps that I used to have.  I also no longer have a 5 o'clock shadow at 3 in the afternoon.  Best of all the shave is the closest thing I've ever had to the shave I got from a barber in Florence, Italy using a steady hand and a scary looking straight blade.

This is the best bet for a shave cream !

Surround yourself with the luscious, tangy, invigorating scent of grapefruit while you smooth and buff your skin. It's really a treat to shower with this. It's a bit thin to be extremely exfoliating but this may not be a drawback if you want something more gentle. It's almost juicy and it conditions and tones too. It's wonderful if you want to use it everyday. It's certainly the most pleasant to use of the scrubs I've tried

The best makeup is not French, but German, and the best German makeup is DR. HAUSCHKA.

The most important thing about this product is that it contains SAFE INGREDIENTS with little or no questionable or toxic material. You are putting makeup on your face and lips. Do you really know what most of it contains? Put your mind at ease with DR. HAUSCHKA.

I'm reviewing the powder, but this review applies to all products from this company

I have pretty oily skin and I break out frequently. I use it on the spot and it dries it up causing it to heal. It doesn't happen over night but there IS a difference. My sister also uses it for her teenage acne and finds it works by keeping the breakouts in check.

I have had ongoing clogged pores, and blackheads since February   of 2004, after being hospitalized for acute asthma and prior treatment including megadoses of Prednisone cortocosteroid, to diminish severe asthma .  However the huge doses of steroids destroyed my immune system and adrenal glands........resulting in hormonal cystic acne, blackheads and clogged pores for 2 years.  Was so depressed that I stopped going out, because of how badly my face looked.  However, after trying every product on the market to treat clogged pores and blackheads with results ranging from none to increasing the acne problem, making it worse than before....I begrudgingly tried one more product.......that being "On A Clear Day Blemish Serum".  Upon receiving it, I tried it for 10 days and achieved OUTSTANDNG results.  I have been using it ever since.  However, i DID have to reorder within 4 weeks; and i just received 6 bottles of it.  I cherish it.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

This stuff works but you have to be careful with it. If you have sensitive skin and a tendency toward OCD it can leave you with one heck of a chemical burn. It does work and work well, but be careful not to use it more than once a day until you figure out what it does on your skin

I love these sets.  It is so handy to have all the right colors in one spot, and not have to rummage around.  Great for travel and busy days.  I have the midtown merlot (which doesn't appear to be offered here yet), and skyscraper on its way.  It's nice to have a primer included to help keep the look longer.  The eyeliner is good too.  Follow Mally's directions and you really will have sexy smokey eyes.  I want all the colors!

I was a bit skeptical at first, using an overnight treatment; I didn't want anything heavy, and gooey on my hair and on my pillow, and possibly traveling to my face and making me break out. This proved to be totally opposite of my fears, it was light and milky, it sank right in and I didn't feel like I had anything on my hair at all. It was very soft right after I put it on, and it had no scent, I guess you don't want it to keep you up at night! Also this is not for everything use, the instructions say 2-3 days a week, so the bottle lasts for quite some time.

I have long hair that I dye and highlight whenever Im in the mood, and this product was just what I needed. I didn't want to chop my ends, and this did a great job of keeping split hairs at bay, and it left them very soft and well groomed. Sometimes hair that gets long has this "old broom" look on the bottom and this magic potion really made the ends silky and straight.

Expensive but a small amount goes for a long long time. If you want long, shiny and luscious hair, then this is a wonderful product to purchase. I don't regret having it at all!

I'm 26 and have used every brand of foundation in search of "THE ONE". When makeup is concerned, you truely get what you pay for. I've used foundations I liked, but never loved. I want a light non-sticky consistency, medium coverage, and a cream to powder finish that doesn't look chalky. This foundation meets and exceeds my expectations. It goes on with a featherlike weight and softness. It turns to a velvety powder that looks so soft and natural, its like the skin I had as a young child. It's not "your makeup looks great", its "your skin looks great". The name is not an overstatement in the least. As for the price, well worth it. How much money do most women spend during years worth of buying and trying out foundations? This is your foundation and powder all in one. A little goes a long way. I highly recommend it!!!!!

This is my first badger shaving brush, and I'm very satisfied with it. I don't know how it compares to the much more expensive brushes out there, but it's certainly a big improvement over the cheap bristle brush I was using in the past. I don't regret not spending more

  I feel for the other people who rated this product but I have the opposite reaction to this shampoo.  I love the smell...it's not the floral scents you get from other shampoos.  Instead the smell is a bit earthy...heck, it's made with nut oils.  As far as the quality of the shampoo...I'll use it forever.  I have fine hair, but a lot of it, and this shampoo ends up being perfect for my hair...detangles but still leaves my hair full and silky.  I can't say enough about it.  Please judge for yourselves...just try the 2 oz size and see what you think

This Spring, add some perkiness and sassiness to your everyday lifestyle without losing your elegance and charisma. Wear "Rock 'N' Rose" Eau de Parfum Spray by Valentino and be as perky and sassy as you can, but still remain elegant and charming as you are!

With its mixture of heady rose, sandalwood, blackcurrant and gardena, this beautiful scent is a knock out. I absolutely love its sweet smell and the staying power is simply amazing! Show off the "rocker" in you but still be as dainty as a pink rose with this "Rock 'N' Rose" perfume by Valentino.

So take a moment . . . and smell the roses!

This is one of Philosophy's 3-in-1 products.  It can be used as shampoo, bubble bath, and shower gel.  I've only used it as a shower gel, so that's all I'm able to review here.  As a shower gel, this product is exceptional.  It's an extremely rich and thick gel, and produces a generous lather with abundant bubbles.  I find it to be somewhat moisturizing- it doesn't explicitly moisturize my skin, but it also doesn't dry it out, even in the winter.  In addition, the gel is opaque and creamy, rather than clear, like most shower gel.  The melon daquiri scent is summery and fruity.  It's a pleasant sweet melons scent.  It doesn't smell especially alcoholic; though it's part of Philosophy's line of 3-in-1s meant to smell like fruity cocktails- like margaritas and pina coladas.  The scent is more fruity melon than alcoholic melon.  That said, people who like juicy, fruity scents will likely love this.  

While I haven't tried using this as a bubble bath or shampoo, the rich lather I get from the shower gel suggests to me that it would probably work very well as the other two parts of the 3-in-1.  The one thing that may be problematic for people- the scent doesn't last beyond the shower.  I can't smell it on my skin anymore when I get out of the shower, though the scent is quite strong while in use.  Some people may find that problematic.  I like that it doesn't clash with my perfume, so it's okay for me.

I use it every time I use make-up. (which isn't very often) but I just love it. It's easy to use and also looks great. Great if you're in a hurry. And plus, it's about a pen size, so you can even just put it in your pencil case. Or evening purse. :

It's been awhile since I bought myself some perfume, so I stood at the counter trying several perfumes. I had tried CK Summer 2006 earlier this year, but didn't get it.

Nothing I tried compared to it that day. So I bought the spray and shower gel.

This glorious perfume has hints of Tangerine, Pineapple, Grapefruit, Frangipani, Sea Breeze, Palm Sap, Driftwood. It's clean--very fresh smelling. I LOVE it! It's a very yummy scent.

If you like citrusy, clean scents, you'll love CK One Summer 2006. It stays on me all day, which is surprising. Usually scents--especially the clean ones I favor--fade as the day goes by.

This is a limited edition, and comes in the blue/green bottle. Don't pass it up!

This is truly the best in highlighting products and I have tried many high end and cheaper products out there.  This is so light and just doesn't get all cakey and greasy.  I have tried so many brands that claim to look natural, but they just don't.  This really does and don't let the price fool you either.  It only takes alittle and lasts a long time, so well worth the price for the look it gives.  I love this!

Okay, I love this!  I got it for Christmas as part of a gift set and I absolutely love it.  It's ideal for in your purse for use on the go...  And the lipgloss smells/tastes great!  And when it's on, it has tiny sparkles of purple that seem to come from nowhere and then disappear just as fast.  Love it!  It lasts a long time, too!

Highly recommended for fans of this perfume who also love a good lipgloss

...This a nice, fruity, sweet scent comprised of apple, peach, freesia &amp; mimosa, so this is best suited to daytime in spring/summer. It smells very similar to Ralph Lauren's `Ralph', so if you like that you'll like this too. 

On the minus side, this scent needs to be applied lightly to avoid headaches, it does get overpowering. (It loses a star for this).

Don't be put of by Paris' name on the bottle - try it!


Oh, the secret ingredient? Pheromones! Let me know if you have any look with it!!

Naturally I have dark brown hair, but I dye it blonde, so I have a lot of dead ends and stray-aways. When I first received this product, I put a little in my hands and rubbed it into my dry hair. At first, I think I put in a little too much, because it was a little greasy, but I was amazed at the results. It instantly flattened and smoothed my hair. The smell was kind of vasoline-like, but don't worry it goes away. If you have dry hair, I definitely recommend this product. I used to use a flat iron on my hair to keep the dead ends from rising, but now I don't even use my flat iron. I just blow dry my hair straight and put a little hair healthy butter on and I'm out the door! I LOVE this product

I've been hearing rave reviews for CD's products all over forums, and I purchased the 8oz. Healthy Hair Butter for my dry, breaking, relaxed hair from Sephora. It has the consistency of Vaseline and when I applied it to my dried hair after washing, it felt very stiff and heavy. It was hard to comb my hair even with my wide-toothed comb and for a few minutes I regretted getting it thinking it would stay like this. I tied my hair into a loose ponytail, and wrapped it with a satin scarf for 20 minutes. When I removed the scarf my hair was unbelievably SOFT and smooth! It felt incredible. It absorbed very well into the hair. I was able to comb through it easily. It felt silky but slightly greasy, but that may have been my fault for adding too much. This is an excellent all-natural conditioner and it smells fantastic. Like lemons and mint and garden fresh. The only issues I have with it are that it's very heavy, so on relaxed hair apply it sparingly, or it will get greasy and weighty. This will be great for controlling new growth. Next time I'll try applying it to wet hair. Overall great product

My skin is smooth now, no blemishes, and I will not switch to any other products, this one is the best..hands down..and believe me...I'v tried them all!!  Thank you Murad!

I'm 28 and have always had what I would call average skin, the kind that most women have. I have normal skin with a little more oiliness in the T-Zone and I get blackheads and the occasional breakout. I have tried all kinds of different product lines (Urban Defense, DDF, Dior, Philosphy, Bliss, etc.) and am the happiest with the results I get from Murad. 
I have been using Murad for about 2 1/2 years now so I have tried a lot of the Murad products and found a routine that works great for me. 

In the morning I use the AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser (love it! the gritiness gives you very smooth surface for applying makeup) then the Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel and the Skin Perfecting Lotion which I mix and apply together so that I don't use as much. Last I put on my Moisture Silk Eye Gel and I'm ready to go.  

At night I use the Clarifying Cleanser followed by the Clarifying Toner, the Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel, the Perfecting Lotion and the best product of all the Night Reform Treatment (see my review of that product for details, I love it!) and again I use the Moisture Silk Eye Gel. 

Once a week I throw in the Exfoliating Fruit Enzyme Mask and I have perfect skin if I stick to the program everyday. My skin looks and feels better than it ever has and people always guess my age to be around 23 so it must be doing something right! 

Top 5 Favorite Murad Products:
1. Soothing Lip Therapy
2. Night Reform Treatment
3. Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel
4. AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser
5. Clarifying Cleanser

Murad Products that I don't like:
1. Day Reform Treatment (too greasy and I hate the smell)
2. Purifying Face Scrub 
3. The products for combination skin - they are ok but the acne line is so mild that people with combination skin will see better results using it. (I have used both product lines)

I've tried a full range of acne products from Proactiv to almost all of the drugstore brands, all of which have been disappointing.  Murad cleanser, however, is actually worth the money.  The cleanser imparts a tingly cooling sensation when used, a little goes a long way (need less than a dime size per use) and I saw clearer skin in less than 2 weeks.  I would recommend this product along with  Murad skin perfecting moisturizer to anyone.

I have tried other products such as ProActiv to help clear up my breakouts...and all have been harsh and may have helped clear my skin a little...but not enough for me to be 100% happy.  However, this product from Murad has completely cleared my skin and is so refreshing to my face.  Plus, I feel that you are definitely getting your money's worth -- this product last a lot longer than any other face wash.  I can't say enough good things about it...great smell, makes your face FEEL clean, ACTUALLY clears your skin, etc.  If you are looking for an alternative to ProActiv, try this.  It will probably take a week or two for you to see your face completely clear...but it will

I've recently started using Murad's Clarifying Cleanser as part of my daily routine and I'm very impressed with the results.  Not only does this cleanser smell fabulous, but it leaves my skin feeling clean and soft with no soapy residue left behind like some cleansers.  And I know that it's working because even after just 3 weeks, my adult acne is almost completely gone

I have combination skin and this has dramatically helped my acne breakouts.  It can be drying at first, but after a week of usage, my skin adjusted.  It's very important to use moisturizer as drying out your skin can also cause breakouts.  Use this and a murad moisturizer (with SPF) and I doubt that you'll be disappointed.

This is the perfect cleanser with my Clarisonic brush. You must use the two together for maximum benefits.. What is great about this cleanser, is that it is extremely gentle, and mild to the skin, yet the brush actions cleanse deep into the pores.

Ever since I started using my Clarisonic brushwith this cleanser, I constantly get compliments on my skin. I have recomeneded this product combination to all my friends and family

I have to admit I tried to find a cheaper sunscreen that does the same things this one does without irritating my skin, but I keep ending back on this one.  It's awesome.  It feels great on your skin, works great, and is so lightweight.  It is so easy to wear under makeup if necessary, and it leaves a flattering look to the skin.  When it first showed up I thought it was an awfully small amount, but then I realized it only takes a tiny, tiny amount to cover your whole face because it's water-light.  So it lasts (at least for me) at least a month with daily use.  In my opinion the only thing they could do to improve this product would be to make it sweat/water-proof, but then it might not feel as good to the skin as it does.  I can't find a better facial sunscreen for the money

I stopped using sunscreen on my face, except at the beach, because all the brands I tried were too oily and heavy, and the directions were to apply UNDER moisturizer and/or foundation. The result was a greasy, shiny face with clogged pores and frequent breakouts.  And then I received a sample of Clarins UV Plus SPF 40.  What a difference!!  Clarins UV Plus is a smooth, light lotion to be applied OVER moisturizer.  (I can't even tell I'm wearing it, except for excellent protection from all the sun's rays.)  Now I wouldn't be without it!  Although the price is $36+, you only have to use a tiny bit, and it lasts a long time.

This is my first Clarins product that I've ever used.  And I honestly am very impressed.  I've always been pretty anal about sunscreen and protection against harmful UV/UVB/Everything else rays.  I've always wanted products with the highest SPF available.  But the problem that I've always run into is that if you want a moisturizer with SPF included, it's usually on SPF 15 or 20...and that is simply not acceptable for me.

Higher SPFs always tended to be much heavier and oilier than I would like, and they caused me to break out frequently - Until Clarins UV Plus!  I am totally in love with this stuff!  It's a tiny tube that will literally last forever!  It has SPF 40 - which is enough protection from practically everything! It has anti-oxidants to fend off pollution.  What more could you ask for.  Yes, it is $35...but keep in mind that you will still need a separate moisturizer.  I use Hope in a Jar on freshly cleansed skin and then I apply my Clarins UV Plus, and I'm good to go.  

Protection is a must in today's world!  UVA/UVB/UV rays are going to bake your skin if you don't do something about it now.  If you're loking for a high quality, high protection product...Look no further

The wonderful thing about CITY Lips is that it really works! I fell in love with it the first time I used it, noticing a difference in the way my lips felt. They were extremely smooth, and unlike every other gloss I have tried, there was no sticky mess.  My lips have never felt so good, being completely hydrated and tremendously soft! I not only love the city lips, but the other city face products are wonderful as well

This product does work - and the night treatment brings out the natural color of my lips and gives a nice gloss. However, the price is just outrageous. $19 would be a more realistic price tag. Also, as anyone who uses a lipgloss that comes in a tube and is applied by a wand knows, the bulk of the product gets trapped up by the entrance of the tube where the wand cannot reach. On top of paying top dollar for this product, I can't reach about a quarter of it! CITY seems to have created a great lip plumping formula, but they need to bring the price down and/or redesign the package

After much scent testing was just thrilled to find this lovely, sweet fragrance! Cannot say I've had the same issues with staying power that a few others noted-- I find this scent quite detectable on my wrists and clothing even after an entire day out and about-- but, just chalk that up to the fact that everyone just has a different chemistry with a scent. I do agree that it is a "light" and subtle scent, certainly not meant to fill an entire room when you enter, but it is sexy, feminine and I've received many complimentary remarks on how pretty it smells. Absolutely love wearing it.

I agree with the previous reviewer, the smell has a candy like fragrance. I generally wear Oscar or Chloe, but this fragrance is a nice change. Doesn't have much staying power, though. It wears off fairly quickly. But it is a lovely scent.

LOVELY! LIGHT AND FRUITY SWEET. AN INNOCENT SCENT IF YOU WILL.  IT SMELLS LIKE COTTON CANDY. THE SCENT DOES NOT LAST VERY LONG AND I FIND THAT I USE IT SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE DAY. I WEAR IT ON DAYS WHEN I AM HOME OR ON WEEKENDS. IT IS MY SIGNATURE "MOMMY" SCENT.  MY KIDS LOVE IT.  
IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SOPHISTICATED SCENT, THIS IS NOT IT.  I RECOMMEND MICHAEL BY MICHAEL KORS IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SENSUAL AND SOPHISTICATED.

I was intrigued when I saw that amazon.com also sold body products such as perfume and make up.  How can you review a scent and convince people to purchase it?  I can't exactly post a scratch and sniff pad online.  I can say that this is one of my all time favorite perfumes.  It smells summery, light, fresh and refreshing, somewhat like Happy by Clinique.  The scent also lasts for a few hours, unlike some other cheaper perfumes.  Another bonus is that the packaging is beautiful: the perfume comes wrapped in a slender white box with a piece of rice paper that has describes flowers in a few different languages.

I absolutely love Clinique for eye shadow. All of their eye shadows go on so smooth, never crease, and are just the perfect shades of colors for my skin tone. The Almost Peach color is great because I can use it as a highlighter under my brow or just as a base, either way I use it just about every day!  :

I bought this product after first trying out Relastin's other product, Revitalizer.  I have really liked the Revitalizer, especially because it actually worked to firm up my skin and reduce my pores.  But I have different problems around my eye area like puffiness and I thought the Eye Silk could address that, which is normally hard to reduce.  So far, the results are good so I am happy with the Eye Silk.  This is worth trying

Pure Poison has a sensual and mysterious scent that is nothing short of invigorating.  But it's something I would only use during the colder seasons just because the weather brings out the scent more pleasantly.  For spring/summer, I would recommend Sunflowers by Elizabeth Arden.

I love this,so does my husband.I bought the entire kit which comes in a lovely satin mini duffel-like purse with a handle.it includes body creme,body wash,perfume.it has a bit of a strong introduction.it doesnt smell like pine-sol like others have said.Its like a re-vamping of the original POISON in the purple bottle.except this one has a sweeter and crisper tone.it becomes light and stays fresh with time.id say its a bit fruity/floral.Good for everyday or a special night out.

This is by far the best shaving product I have ever used. Yes, it is pricey, but if you can get past that, you won't be disappointed.

I hesitated to purchase this for months b/c of the price, but my friend gave me a sample to try-- I was hooked! It is decandent &amp; creamy, &amp; a little goes a long way. I also used to spend more money on expensive razors to get a closer shave; I now only use the cheapie razors &amp; my legs are so much smoother than before! I also use this under my arms &amp; have NO irritation (this was another hesitation, as I have very sensative skin). 

The fragrance is amazing as well. Sweet, as in the name, but not overpowering. This works very well as a layering to Benefit's other scented products, or their Maybe Baby fragrance, as they all smell similar enough to compliment one another.

The first time I used this, it was purchased for me as a gift.  It took me a couple of times to get the hang of it after using other foams and gels, but once I did, I was addicted.

Then I had to buy my own.  Just about fell over at the price.  It works great and I haven't had a nick or touch of razorburn since using it, but when I can go to another store and buy another product to shave with for 1/4 the price, I sometimes ask myself if it's worth it.  I just use it lightly and make it last as long as I can

Like others, I was skeptical about a shampoo bar. I really,really like this bar. It has a great scent. The first time I used it, the smell stayed in my hair most of the day, and now it lasts a few hours. Its a pretty deep cleanse, so I really only use it when I've been at bars or when my hair is full of product. I use it about twice a week or so. It has a really great lather. My boyfriend even uses it, since the smell isn't floral, but rather spicy in nature. The little cinnamon sticks fall out after a while, but the bar itself has held. I will definitely buy again. If you have dry hair, you should probably use this sparingly, as your hair will be 'squeaky' clean, or just make sure to follow-up with a good conditioner

I am on my second bar of this stuff now and, wow-there's so much I can say about it!  First the smell in honestly awesome and second, after only a week of use, I got all of these "baby" hairs cropping out over my head-this is awesome to me since, though I'm not currently loosing my hair, I have a strong family history of hair loss!  I also have VERY oily hair-the kind of hair that needs washed EVERY DAY or I look like I'm homeless but after using this shampoo I can skip a day and-for the first time in my life-you can't tell it my the condition of my hair!!  My only issue with this is that even though my scalp is oily, my ends are dry and I have to use just a tiny bit of cream conditioner along with it-also this item dissolves SUPER quick if you leave it in the shower and makes everything in your shower pink...but other than that I strongly recommend this item to anyone curious

This product is wonderful. I have extremely thick and unruly hair which always needs to be conditioned in order to get a brush through it. It's also started falling out by the handfuls since the birth of my daughter (an iron deficiency may be the culprit). This solid shampoo bar leaves my hair soft and shiny, and I DON'T need a conditioner. It lathers up wonderfully, too. So far, I've also noticed that hairs don't come away when I run my fingers through it, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that NEW! will help me to combat the hair loss. And, lastly, LUSH sent me a tin to keep it in, which I thought was pretty cool.

I was totally skeptical about purchasing a solid shampoo. I was also completely NEW to LUSH products in general. WOW, was I surprised when I used this little bar! At first I was surprised at how small the bar itself is. I thought it wouldn't last a few washes...but it's absolutly amazing! I am a male and all I need to do is rub this bar on my head twice and my head is full of rich, thick suds! The lathering is amazing!!! There really are NO WORDS to describe how amazingly well this lathers. The scent is DELICIOUS! I love the cinnamon, spicey, almost "holiday" type scent. It is very pleasant and refreshing at the same time. I don't know how well this shampoo is for actually moisturizing (I have dry hair and my hair has pretty much stayed the same texture-so I can't say that this softens very well) but the scent and lathering-action alone were well worth the price for me. I can't wait to try more products from Lush

I have used many Lush products and some I love, some I HATE!  This one definitely falls in the LOVE category.  I have thick, medium texture, color-treated, slightly wavy hair.  This stuff works!!  I use it every other wash to remove all the residue from salon shampoos, conditioners, and products.  It makes my hair so shiny.  It lasts forever, about 3 months using it every other day.  Be sure to store it where it will not get wet - I use disposable gladware.  And, I haven't even gotten to the best part.  The smell is refreshing - mostly cinnamon and it makes your scalp tingle just a bit.  Can't say enough about this one!

This is a good product to use in the shower when you want to scrub on your cellulite.  It feels good and does not hurt to rub.  I don't think I use it enough to see if it makes a big difference but I'd like to think it does.  It does get the circulation going.  I like this product and will continue to use it.

This scent is a bit softer than many men's fragrances. It's a unique powdery scent. I like how it is not too strong and overbearing on one spray. Just enough so my girl can smell it when she hugs me or sits next to me. I also use Acqua di Gio and it is a good contrast to this scent. I get compliments for both scents

Of all the Philosophy line, I find that this is the best consistency-wise.  It's much thicker than the Amazing or Baby Grace gels, and leaves your hair and skin much softer, and smelling like Ivory soap.  Very clean scented, not too girly.

I really really love this product. It is the first rub in moisturizer I have ever used that smooths in evenly without leaving a sticky, slick feeling all over my hands. I think it actually has helped my cuticles as well.. But, it works wonderfully on frizz and damaged ends. It really seems to smooth and repair them

I have fine hair, and this did nothing to make my hair oily or weigh it down. It helped emphasize my natural wave and eliminated the need to heat-style. Plus, no frizzies! One thing to keep in mind: This is a PRE shampoo treatment, so make sure you use it before you shower and then wash it out. Your hair shouldn't get too greasy if you wash it out. You can also warm a little in your hands and pull through your ends as a hydrating styling product. The smell is a little "unique," not bad exactly, but you can always wash it out with your favorite-smelling shampoo. However, the whole line by Ojon is good, so I'd recommend the shampoo, conditioner, and styling cream too.

I've read the reviews, and it seems that only people with thick, coarse hair think this is right for them. Well, I have very fine hair that is chemically processed, and I've tried literally every product on the market. This makes my hair extremely soft and FULL! So far I've only used the restorative treatment, but after seeing the amazing results it gives, I'm ready to try the whole line.

It smells to me like mocha coffee, and I absolutely LOVE the smell, when I'm using it I run my hands through my hair and sniff them constantly - my husband laughs at me. I do think it's an earthy smell that some people would not like, though. It's kind of like patchouli, you either love it or hate it.

I know the price tag is a bit daunting - but a little does go a long way, so it lasts forever. And it's helping a tribe in Central America to thrive - that helps you feel a little better about spending the money.

I read the reviews of this product, and decided to go for it.  I love the smell (although it is a distinctive scent and it may not be for everyone), and it does make my hair really soft.  However, I have semi-fine hair, and it made my hair really oily-looking, even though I used a tiny amount.  I think people with thicker hair may benefit more from this hair treatment.  It reminds me of glorified coco butter with just a few more ingredients (and coco butter is way cheaper). 

I will use Ojon Restorative Hair Treatment again, but probably only on the weekends when I'm not going to work (because of the oily look).  

The bottom line is, definately smell it first to make sure you like it!  They sell it at Pure Beauty stores, among other places.  And, if you can try it somewhere before you buy it, do it!  Make sure it doesn't give you the "oily" look

i'm a true product junkie. i've tried more crap and spent more money on stuff for my colored, processed, blow dried, ironed, wavy damaged weak hair then any sane human being would...but i think i finally found my soulmate of a product...

first i must say it smells divine like mocha coffee...

i use this product daily before bed every night and in the morning after i towel dry my hair..it is the ONLY product i leave in my hair after shower whether i wear it naturally wavy or blow dry it straight...sometimes i will add the ojon gloss serum if i feel my hair needs it...

a little goes a long way, my past bottom of bra thick hair uses about the size of a tablespoon...

since using this product 2 weeks my hair is significantly shinier, softer, way less frizz, no more puff and not as porous.my color also looks more vibrant which is great b/c it's blonde and was getting brassy. and i noticed results right after the 1st treatment.

i especially love that it's good for your hair and the purchase contributions helps the tribe in central america who gather the oil from their trees. =)


it is pricey but worth every cent and then some. you can't put a price of true beauty right

I brought the kit which included both the ultra hydrating shampoo and conditioner as well as the hair treatment from QVC.  First of all, lets talk about the smell.  Yes there is a smell but it's not really that bad, honestly.  It has a slight coffee smell, but since I used the hair treatment as a pre-shampoo treatment, the smell wasn't really worth complaining about because it's not noticable after you shampoo.  Second, the hair treatment is absolutely great for hair that has been in braided styles for extended periods of time or has just been mistreated and needs a little TLC.  It restores moisture and elasticity to my starving hair.  I don't have course or very kinky hair, but it is very thick and this stuff works very well with my thick hair.  It also moisturizes the scalp, which I love.  The only thing I'd want to change is the price, wish it was a little cheaper, but because it's not, I guess I value it all the more

Ok, this stuff is a bit like putting grease in your hair, but you use no more than a rice-sized amount and it will add shine and make your hair feel more healthy (and it may actually be!). I find the more I use it, the better my hair seems. It does have a slight odor similar to coffee beans, but I like that smell so it doesn't bother me. If your hair is dry or over-processed this stuff is for you -  but if your hair is just very fine and limp, I don't think this product would be for you

I have been hooked on this foundation since I found it at the Bloomdale's counter in NYC in 2002. I have oily complexion and this keeps my face not just looking but also feeling fresh and wonderful.I have skin issues but with this foundation as an example this morning all men see is a WOW face. My shade is definitely Honey, find your perfect shade/color match and you too will fall in love with Bobbi Brown Foundation. I refuse to use anything else, why mess with WOW

Every other foundation I've tried has had some ashy undertone, no matter what color I tried, and even when the color itself was right. This one was the exceptation. They seemed to have got the undertone thing right. I got great coverage, and at the same time managed to have it looking natural. It's oil free, but not chalky: think dewy, not greasy, which I appreciate as a person with oily skin. My skin looked like it was naturally near-flawless and even, but it also lookked like I was wearing little to no foundation. I hear it's buildable though, so someone who likes cake-face makeup could have that with it

"Holly, you smell like roses!" is what I hear anytime someone comes near me. And its all thanks to this little bottle of wonders. Normally fragrance gives me severe hives, but not this. I am beautifully scented and hive free. AND it DOESN'T smell like old lady Big Lots perfume. It smells like actual roses. I once compared it to a real rose and the smells were identical. I am a teen and am constantly complimented on this scent by my peers. I even put a little in my hair to help smooth split ends. A wonderul product, deserving of 10 stars

I gave this four stars because of the price and because I bought a concealer brush for the cream and have since found my finger does the trick nicely!
Aside from that, the effect of looking at your face in the mirror without any darkness under your eyes leaves you a little shocked at first...there is something wrong!  Until you realise that you just look really...fresh. There is no other word. You look like you've had a great nights' sleep and your whole face seems brighter because of it. Although it is a little on the pricey side..bear in mind you really don't need to use that much of it..the powder is great to matte everything out and the little mirror inside the lid is so helpful too! I know this is a great investment as everyone needs to conceal the stress, bad sleep and lifestyle from under their eyes! Bobby Brown is an expert at creating natural looking makeup that makes you look like the best version of yourself

All i can say is this product is great, because of my Indian Heritage, i got the dark circle around my eyes and after the baby my dark cirlce got worse. I looked so tired and older with the dark cirlces. I bough a lot of products to cover my undereye dark circles, but i was not happy at all. I was keep trying new concealers but no satisfaction at all.  One day i went to a store they sell Bobbi products, and i was just looking for a powder that matched my skin tone from bobbi brown. They got me the right powder color and she asked me to try out some of the Bobbi Brown Creamy Concealer for my dark cirlces. I was not sure but i let her try it on me. I was so happy to see my dark circles gone. And i keep getting compliments how fresh i look and makes me feel pretty. Since than its my all time favourite. A little goes a long way. And i think its great for people with serious dark circles. I got a little kit with a small mirror, included with  a yellow based concealer and a a little darker creamy concealer to even out the yellow concealer with your skin color and a yellow powder for the finishing touch.
You just have to get the right color of concealer for your skin complexion. 
Its a little expensive for that small kit but i love it its the money worth

I received Lancome Le Stylo Waterproof Long Lasting Eyeliner as a gift from my best friend on my last birthday. Since we are both in love with make up, she knew what to get. I fell in love with this eyeliner because it was smooth and easy to apply and it looked great. It works very well and very long lasting. They have different color and all of them are pretty. Even though, Lancome is a pretty pricey brand, the product pays for it.

I absolutely love Clinique for eye shadow. All of their eye shadows go on so smooth, never crease, and are just the perfect shades of colors for my skin tone. The Almost Peach color is great because I can use it as a highlighter under my brow or just as a base, either way I use it just about every day!  :

And then some....

I try to take good care of my skin and have tried just about every "fine line" or general facial moisturizing cream available over the years.  

I purchased some makeup recently from Sephora.com and got a free sample of the Kinerase cream and decided to try it.  Within two days (no kidding) I noticed a difference in my skin tone.  I began to notice a more "fresh" look - rosy, if you will.  I had some light freckles as well, which started getting even lighter.  

I decided right then and there to get some of this cream, as I was quickly running out of the small free sample.  That was when I learned how expensive it is.  :-(  However, I decided that since this has made more of a difference in my skin in just DAYS that I would bite the bullet and spend the money.

I can't tell yet whether it's really helping some of the fine lines I have, but just based on what it's done for my skin tone and color -- I can honestly say it's worth every single penny.  Until they come out with a cream that can perfect skin tone in a day I'm sticking with this stuff....and singing it's praises

Within two days of using this cream, I waa astonished at the results!  My skin tone completely evened out, and my skin appeared smoother than it ever has in my life.  And it does add a glow.  I'm not so sure tha it really works on eliminating wrinkles, but the other effects are well worth every penny

I wish I could agree with the PP, but I still have a problem with feathering and I have tried everything. This product works very well. I can wear the sheerest of lip glosses and it stays within my lip line. With dark colors, I no longer have to worry about the feathering that always occurs this keeps lip color inside your lipline. This also works nice as an eyebrow wax

I am so glad that I purchased this cologne from Amazon for a Christmas gift.  I also had it shipped directly to the home where the gift was going to be opened.  This was a good thing, since MY home was burglarized 4 days before Christmas and they stole all of our gifts. If this one had been under my tree, it would have been gone.  The convenience of ordering online and shipping to the person is wonderful

This shower gel works really well--you can use it as a general soap, and it's very mild, so you can use it anywhere (ah hem..) on your body without it stinging, or burning. I haven't tried it as a shampoo. Works quite well for shaving. Good consistency. Smells exactly like fresh banana. More of a fruity banana scent, like a tropical lifesaver, than a baked banana bread scent, if that helps any. Pricewise, this is actually one of the more affordable upscale shower gels per ounce, assuming you buy the large bottle of just one scent. Also, this stuff preserves very well. I still have some Philosophy eggnogg (!) shower gel that I bought for the holidays, and I have now used it through 2 Christmases and it still smells great..

I admit: slathering on hand cream and putting on a pair of gloves is my Sunday morning indulgence. Usually, plain cotton gloves have done the job just fine. The first time I tried these,though, I noticed the difference immediately. The fabric seals in moisture and you get the pleasant sensation of your hands being lightly massaged.
When I took off the gloves, my hands looked and felt incredibly soft and supple. If you have very dry hands, these would be great if you wore them overnight.
They're very cheap too. A really worthwhile investment and highly recommended

For a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is MAC. Lipglass feels good on your lips, as if it contained some emollients. And (this is a big AND) it's not tacky or sticky. 

The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. 

Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. 

Enjoy!

MAC LipGlass is the absolute best. There are plenty of colors to choose from, SUPER-Shiny, and the gloss is thick, stays on and doesn't run. 
The best colors are....
NICO for a cute lavender pink color with a glittery shine. 
OYSTERGIRL is a shimmery baby pink.
OH BABY is the perfect gloss for any earth toned lipstick.
CHAI looks amazing with black smokey eyes. It's the perfect neutral earthy gloss and has no glitter or shimmer - just pure shine

I'm REALLY anal about scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored with vanilla, but MAC LipGlass isn't that vanilla-ish at all!  It's got very pigmented color, it stays on a LONG time for a gloss, and each tube lasts a long time...  Don't let what the other reviewer said about the vanilla scent throw you off

This is the toner that won't dry out my skin.

I bought the whole set and I have combination dry skin. 

The first day I thought it was strong. Second day, I can see on the cotton pad my black head on my nose. It worked! 

Along with the other 2 products, this toner made my skin glow in just a week.  My skin looked very healthy and beautiful. 

For people that have problems with this toner, don't use it during winter time. I avoid toner in general during winter time since I know my skin is already too dry. All I use is the mild cleanser and lotion. For Spring and summer, I use the whole set.

With Clinique products, the key is knowing your skin type. I took the quiz at [...] in order to decide which products to buy for the 3step system and the results showed Clarifying Lotion #2 as the appropriate option. I was a little worried when I read reviews on Amazon.com that said it was too strong and had given some individuals rashes, but I used it anyway. It works beautifully. If you buy this lotion and get a rash or breakout it's because you didn't consult with a clinique source or are unaware of your true skin type. So long as you buy the right products for you, it's going to do everything it promises and more...I highly recommend it

Clinique Clarifying Lotion is Step #2 in their 3-step skin care system.  (You start with their soap, and then follow the lotion with the Dramatically Different Moisturizer).  What I love about this one, made for larger pores, is that really effectively exfoliates and resurfaces your skin without stripping it of its natural oils too much.  You really feel it working, to pull out the impurities.  Well worth the investment....

I've been using this product, along with the mild facial soap and dramatically different moisturizer, for fourteen years now. I remember my consultation with the Clinique rep like it was yesterday. And therein lies the rub--if you've never used these products and are considering doing so, it is best to visit a Clinique representative to help you decide which products are best for your skin. A lot of times, people do not know what skin type they have or think they have one when it's really another. If you're not using the right ones for your skin type, you won't get the results you need. The Clinique reps can help. Talk to them first and then you can purchase anywhere!

I myself have the combination skin. The Clinique rep warned me that I might have some initial blemishes, and I did, but they tapered off after a week or so. Just out of the shower, or after a long day of who knows what may have gotten on your skin, this is an uplifting, cooling-when-it's-hot, breath of fresh zinginess. Often one all over swipe with this on a cotton ball is not enough--so use the other side of the puff, dab on more clarifying lotion and apply again, and maybe more with another cotton ball till it no longer turns any shade. This is worth it. You are taking off not only the makeup that the facial soap may not have caught, but any impurities that daily activity can attract to the skin--dirty fingers unconciously rubbed over the neck or cheek, etc. Follow up with the Clinique moisturizer that's right for you and your skin will feel five times lighter. Your skin is important. These products have helped mine stay in amazing shape over the years

I know that this is for reviews about clarifying lotion 2 but I thought that I would let people know about a new product Clarifying moisture lotion 2.

I have dry, sensitive skin and when assessed by the girls at the clinique counter I came out as a skin type I/II.  I use the extra mild facial soap, the clarifying moisture lotion 2 and the dramatically different moisturising lotion.  

When I looked at the reviews here on amazon I was suprised to find so many people were unhappy with the product, but I happened to go to the clinique counter the other day and found that in Australia there are two ranges of clarifying lotions, the original, which was what everyone was talking about, and the new moisture lotions.  According to the sales assistants the new moisture lotion was developed for the asian market and is alcohol free and being in the asian region Australia luckily gets both.

They exfoliate like the regular lotions but there is no sting or tingle and the skin feels really soft.  My face feels like polished marble at the moment and my makeup is going on and staying much better than before. I can tell you that my skin has never looked better since starting on Clinique and I would recomend this skin care line to anyone.

I have used this skin care system for the past 3 years without any issues. This works perfectly with my combination skin making it seem just like "normal" skin.

Additionally, my breakouts have been reduced to virtually nothing (like one pimple every 3 months compared to several breakouts a month). 

If you have never used these products you would benefit from going to the mall and having one of the consultants explain the product usage

I love this scent, I got it when it first came out in 2004, they gave away samples in the Macy's Impulse show and it has become my signature scent since then.  I receive lots of complements from everyone in the office since it really works with my body chemistry.  I work in a department mostly populated by men and they all tell me that this is the first perfume that does not irritate them.  Go out and try this scent.  It changes with time, to become a bit floral after a few hours, but my body chemistry can maintain the crisp, fresh, apple scent so it really works for me.  I love it

True or False?

1.	Beauty is only skin deep (read: physical beauty is superficial). 
2.	Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder (read: everyone is beautiful).

If anything my decade and half long stint as stylist and fashion editor has taught me, it is that a) physical beauty might be skin deep but its creation and maintenance is as complex a task as coming up with the theory of relativity b) beauty never lies in the eyes of the beholder...all beauty is about tricking the beholder to feel in a certain kind of way.

So banish all your old worn out mantras about beauty and adopt a new one. Beauty is hard work and Beauty is savvy. The Body Shop Skin Focus Face Illuminator passes both these litmus tests. For starters you are going to save a cool 14 bucks when you add this petite tube to your arsenal and before you scream, "what about quality?" let me assure you that a few dabs of this booster boy at the beginning or the end of your day (remember to wash and pat dry your face though) and your face will glow with that fresh faced allure that you last saw only in the black and white scrap books of your grandma.

p.s: Everyone is not born beautiful. I have seen enough. I know. You have to work at it.

p.p.s.:  And if it lightens your conscience any, the delightful gunk in this tiny tube has not been tried out on animals before. You'll be the first person to get a rash. Just kidding!

The price of this shave brush may seem high, but after shopping around, I found it to be fair. The quality of the brush is great. It is more modern looking than most others on the market without going overboard on the stainless steel. I use this shave brush daily with shave cream from the body shop

This was purchased as a gift for my son's 14-yr-old girlfriend for Valentine's Day. The heart shape of the container, as well as the nice color of the lip gloss made it a perfect gift for her

They put the lip gloss in a key chain. Its convenient to have with you on your keys so you can do a touch up anytime or moisturize your lips. Good quality, good product, nice lip gloss. Overall 3.5 stars.

It is probably smaller than a one inch cube so it isn't a whole lot of gloss, but is a key chain so it can't be too big. Very cute

At first glance this product may seem too intense to wear during the daytime but let me persuade you otherwise.  By using the suggested brush the unique texture that is a slight dry gel provides eye definition without looking nightclub ready at 9 am.  However, when you're ready to rock 'n roll this product can go on thicker and smudged creates a perfect smoky eye.  Additionally it stays on until removed and does not flake or smudge once dry.  The pot it comes in is quite large and deep so the purchase price actually is not excessive.  Great product from a dependable favorite line.

        These eye liners have a creamy, soft  texture that results in a satiny matte finish.  The texture makes them easy to apply (no liquid drops on cheeks) for either a classic thin line or a smudged smoky effect.

	Two shades are available - Black and Indigo.  The Black is jet, a true black, and the Indigo merits its name as it is a deep, deep blue that looks stunning on any eye color.

	Best part is that the color lasts all day and into evening without fading or running.  It can be used either wet or dry depending on the effect you want.  And, of course, they both come in Mercier's trim mirrored signature compact.

	Hint: Apply a line just above the upper lash roots to make lashes look fuller and thicker.  Amazing

I was looking for a summer scent.  This is the perfect summer scent.  It's refreshing, feminine and has a clean scent!  Definitlely, not overpowering for a hot summer day.  I allowed my friend to borrow my bottle for her wedding and she received many compliments during the day..both from her new husband and many of her guests!  This is definitely a great buy for the summer.  As far as it staying on, I beleive it last for quite a while.  Just when I think it's disappeared, someone ask me what I am wearing...you won't regret the purchase

This is a classic fragrance, not your overpowering J-Lo, B'Spears, etc.  I wish I could explain the scent...but it is tough to describe.  It isn't fruity or flowery.  Perhaps a bit of lavendar though?  Basically, you don't overpower a room with it.  It has a bit of an "old-world"-ness to it...but as far as I am concerned, that is a wonderful thing.  I am a 31 year old professional, I wear it daily and out at night, and I just love it

I recieved this perfume for Christmas from my husband. I love it. I am very picky about scents - I actually didn't have any until I recieved this one. I had given all the others away for being too strong, too flowery, too sweet, etc.

I love this scent. It is subtle and not overwhelming. So, I thought I would write a review to let people know that, while others may not like it, I do

After seeing SJP promote her new fragrance on Oprah, I had to smell it for myself! I got my chance in a magazine, and boy did I love it! I had hoped to get it as a gift, because it seems a bit pricey to me. However, I didn't get it. Still not sure if I want to spend the money on it, but I do love the scent

      Is there anyone who doesn't know the name Sarah Jessica Parker?  Okay.  Think "Carrie" on TV's enormously successful "Sex and the City."  She was the gal who dressed to the nines - always with style and glamour.  She brings both of those qualities to her first fragrance, "Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker."

	It's a unique, almost indescribable blend of classicism, chic, and innocence.  There's not a scent like it with top notes of fresh Mandarin, Bergamot, Lavender, and Apple Martini. Vibrant and warm it's  a fragrance that caresses the senses.

	Middles notes are Patchouli, tender Paper Whites, and luxe Orchid.  These are enhanced by bottom notes of irresistible white amber, sensuous cedar, and the very sultry musk.  This is a scent I revel in, and  enjoy wearing.

	The bottle is, of course, simple and exquisite, curved with polished glass, ultra feminine.

	Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker is a beautiful, dreamy yet quite alive fragrance appropriate for every occasion

I bought this product three weeks ago and I have seen great improvements on my skin already.  I have never really used skin products but I have been living in Florida for over 20 years I have a lot of spots due to sun damage.  A friend of mine told me about this product that his wife bought for him.  So, I decided to give it a try and it has really shown great results! The spots on my skin are diminishing and my face looks better. I have decided to try some of the other Menscience products. My wife also started using the product, so you may have to buy two

This eyeliner works as described. I would give it 5-stars except I'm not a big fan of liquid eyeliners that use a brush. It can be too hard to control the applicator, especially if you want to apply under the lower lashes. Since this is a brush on liquid eyeliner, it can't easily be smudged for a smoky look. Of course, the fact that it can't be smudged, once it is dried, is the whole point of this product. It can be cleaned up before it dries, but once it sets, it will stay there until you take it off. When you want to take it off, it comes off very easily, and cleanly, and really doesn't require anything but plain water to remove. I've found that very helpful when I travel. I also have sensitive eyes, but this product has not bothered me at all, probably because it doesn't flake or transfer into my eyes.  If there was just some way to get this product in a "marker" style, and a few more colors, I would be in heaven, even with the high price

I got dream cream as a gift and I am able to use just a little bit and it keeps my skin so soft, the other day someone actually told me how soft it was.

I tried this at the LUSH store in Bellevue, I didn't like how it felt at first because it felt greasy to me but I soon realized I had used too much, it doesn't take much.

I got a free sample after purchasing other products there and my skin has been very dry because I am on a diuretic, this is helping my hands a bunch and I was suprised because I had a small cut on my finger that the skin was drying out around and it was catching on my clothes and other things. Within two days of useing the product the dry skin cleared up and the cut healed with almost no mark at all!

I love the mild, clean smell and soft feel

I've a mild case of eczema, so am also always keeping an eye out for products that can help my skin, without resorting to cortizone creams... I've had some success in the past with using straight jojoba and coconut oil on the eczema patches - but not enough to keep up with the hassle of oily spots of skin. I even tried making my own recipes - to some success. But, it was time consuming and I just don't have the time to mess around with kitchen cosmetics for a hobby.
After looking at the reviews for various types of lotions/creams in the Lush line, I decided to give this one a go. I've only been using it for a couple of days, but already my skin is less irritated, and the scaliness seems to be diminishing some. (eczema strikes the top of my feet and a bit of the ankle... makes wearing combat boots a bit annoying when its acting up)
I'll probably need another week or two of steady use to really know if it works as I'm hoping, but so far so good...
There's no real strong scent to the lotion - so it shouldn't bother those who are sensitive to smells. So also pretty cool on that end as well :-)
Works great on the rest of my skin as well!! No more dryness from the winter weather anymore

HI

<review_text>
I initially bought LUSH's Dream Cream because I recently started to wax my arms and I wanted something to help soothe and minimize any irritated skin.  The wax kit did come with `Soothing Oil' that is suppose to help, but it's too oily to leave on the skin.

I've been a LUSH fan for a while, and the sales person led me to Dream Cream.  It has really soothing ingredients, like oat milk, olive oil, chamomile, and tea tree oil, so I took a sample home.

I just waxed tonight and put Dream Cream on after.  What a HUGE difference.  There was very minimal redness and no irritated bumps.  I usually get these mosquito-like bumps whenever I wax, but I didn't get any.  The next morning, I couldn't even tell I just waxed my arms because my skin was so "normal".

Dream Cream also works great to cut down on red bumps after shaving, and as a soothing lotion for itchy skin.  I will be getting more to use after waxing and shaving.  Definitely worth trying.  It's not LUSH's best selling lotion for no reason

I was browsing a Lush Newsletter and read that Dream Cream had been used to alleviate the horribly painful dry skin that accompanies cancer patient's skin during the course of chemotherapy.  Since a family member was undergoing both chemotherapy and radiation therapy, I thought I would buy a tub and see if it did indeed relieve the horrid eczema-like patches of skin covering her body. I figured we had nothing to lose; we had tried everything else and had not found anything that worked yet. Being eternal skeptics, I have to say that we were both pleasantly surprised at how well it worked. It immediately relived the burning and itching that often accompanies dry skin. It took a couple of days of liberally applying the lotion 2-4 times a day for the swelling and redness to diminish, but it did finally disappear. I think if you have standard dry skin, applying it this often might make you feel a bit on the greasy side.  I found that it if you have particularly painful dry skin, it helps to keep the tub of Dream Cream in the refrigerator. The coolness of the lotion further augments the relieving properties of the essential oils in the cream. 
	
I would have to say that a little of this cream does go quite a long way.  If you slather a ton of it on at once, it will leave you feeling a bit sticky. An earlier review mentioned that it can leave you feeling greasy if you put it on your face; however, it should be noted that Dream Cream is meant to be used on the hands and body and not meant to be used as a facial moisturizer. 

I would also have to say that the scent is definitely herbal, but the scent (at least for my tub of Dream Cream) was quite subtle.  I did not find it overwhelming. If you are particularly fond of the strong scents that characterize many of Lush's products, then you might be disappointed in this cream. But, if you have dry, itchy, scaly skin, I would strongly recommend this cream.  It is expensive, but it is definitely worth it.

Living in hot and steamy Florida, and looking for something refreshing, I have gone through a range of Philosphy's lemony shower gel combos: first Sweet Sugar (very nice sugar smell, with a hint of lemon) to Frozen Lemon Custard ( didn't like it at all- too much of an artificial vanilla smell, but the first time I didn't like a Philosophy product) and now to Lemonade. I love the smell, like sniffing a real lemon, not a fake lemon scent. Very fresh and clean.  I am following it up with the lemon body souffle and Sweet sugar cologne for a cool, light summery scent. 
As for those who say Philosophy's products cost a lot- they pay a living wage to their employees and put more money on high-quality ingredients for the product, not on packaging and advertising.  Not to get heavy, but I'd rather have a really good quality product than have my dollars going to fancy packaging and an advertising campaign featuring some over-priced cokehead model. 
So, feeling fresh and clean physically and ethically

Philosophy has managed to do it yet again.......  what is unique about this??  Well it is a three in one product it has shampoo, bubble bath and also body wash.  I am not a big one for baths so I admit I did not try that.  I did however use it for the other uses.  Well the fact is that there are a lot of soap products that you can use in the shower, for washing your hair, and also for a bubble bath.  

It lathers up nicely but not excessively......  so what??


Well the most unique thing about this product is the lemon scent.  I love this.  It is very strong and it also manages to scent up the bathroom when I am taking a shower.  I really like the scent of lemons.  If you dont like it then there are other products.  They have this in apple, coconut and some other scent........maybe strawberry??  I personally like the lemon scent the most.  
I have tried other philosophy products and honestly they do not have a bad one.  They do not advertise this but if this stuff does get in your eyes, it stings very little.  

The only drawback is the fact that it is quite frankly expensive........ about a dollar an ounce. There are other products....and I guess you still need a conditioner for your hair

I received this lip gloss a few years ago in a Christmas present, and then I couldn't find it and forgot about it. But a friend of mine had this and was using this same lip gloss a couple of weeks ago and I remembered how great it was. This is one of the best lip glosses/balms I've ever used. The flavor is fantastic and the moisture it gives your lips is unbeatable. It's not sticky, it's not even really noticeable. It's very "natural beauty" if you know what I mean.  :

This is probably the most expensive lotion I have ever bought for myself. Felt bad at first for the price but then my skin was saved! Never have I felt so happy the past winter when there is no crack, irritation on my skin. The lotion smoothes and make my face feel great. Better than ever!

The pump won't do any difference and it is more expensive, just to let you know. I have both the lotion and the gel but prefer the lotion.

It does work really well in the set of 3 but it's ok to get only the lotion. I guarantee that you won't regret

I have extremely oily skin.  It wasn't unusual for me to wash my face three to four times a day to keep it from shining.  As a result of the oily skin and humid temps (I live in S. Georgia), makeup would just slide down my face and I'd end up feeling like I stuck my head in Crisco by the end of the day.  A friend suggested Clinique and though the oil isn't completely gone...which wouldn't be desireable anyways...it is finally manageable.

I got the DDM lotion as part of the three step program Clinique offers, but I think that the lotion is solely responsible for the changes in my skin.  I could leave or take the toner and soap, which don't seem to be any different than less expensive versions readily available at drugstores.  The lotion though...Wow!  It doesn't go on greasy or watery.  Instead, it has a nice and light consistency that is easy to smooth over your skin but is thick enough that it's not hard to contain or control with your fingertips.  As soon as you rub it in, you notice the mattifying properties.  The lotion actually helps to reduce shine by itself, but without any tightness or by depriving your skin of its moisture.  Some of the stuff I've tried in the past only dried my skin out temporarily and then the oil glands would really start to kick in with a vengence, but with this lotion I haven't had any of those problems.  My skin is now smoother than it's ever been, and the oil glands are apparently appeased as well because I haven't had to wash my face in the middle of the afternoons anymore.

This is a great moisturizer. It does not leave your skin feeling like it has an oil slick and also does not make it feel dry after it absorbs into it. It is great under makeup as it does not make your makeup slide off your face. I have been using it for years. Best moisturizer I ever tried.  It isn't great for night time wear, as I like something a little heavier at night/ I am in my forties and night time I need something a little heavier to moisturize my face. If you are twenty something you probably could just use the Clinique product

This product really does apply like butter and is very rich in moisturizers. I have been using it for years and giving it as Christmas gifts. I use it as a very rich treatment for dry legs, heels, elbows. I love the fresh mango fragrance. Before bed, I often cover my feet with Mango Body Butter, slip on socks, and let the good stuff soak in overnight. Then I feel very pampered and I wake up with soft feet

I found this soap in a honey shop in Paris in winter 2006 and after the first use I told my friends about it and afterwards they bought the same soap and continue to buy it today.  It smells like olive oil, but it doesn't smell strongly.  I recommend people using this soap lather and rinse twice in a row for best results, it will make your skin soft and smooth and the natural ingredients make the results long lasting, I use it once every three or four days but it's gentle enough to use every day.  I wish I had bought more while in Paris because it is impossible to find in California

	It seems no one can escape.  There are times when even the best tressed need help with their hair.  Sun, sand, and surf may leave you with many happy memories, but it can also leave hair looking like...well, let's not talk about it.

	Perms, coloring, all intended to make us look better - let's face it, can sometimes leave hair dry and lusterless.

	Time to get serious with Shea butter.  Frederic Fekkai's Moisturizing Conditioner with Shea Butter is a rich, creamy healing potion for less than healthy locks.  It truly hydrates, smells delicious, and nourishes damaged hair.  If your hair is thick, it's also a marvelous detangler.

	Only a small amount is needed - simply apply after shampooing and comb through.  What a difference Fekkai makes

I love that it is not only environmentally friendly, but it is also an incredible moisturizing lipstick. It's very sheer color but you can use a lip liner for a little more pizazz. And we grew the wildflower seeds from the box! Fun and well worth the money. I have 3 shades, Nahinni, Sagarmartha, &amp; Mariska. I prefer the more neutral Mariska

I am a believer now.  

I bought this because I saw a demonstration on QVC.  I really needed a great scrub since I use a spray tan and a great exfloliator helps.  

I'm not sure what amazing grace really smells like, but I liked this smell.  Its not over-powering and not over-perfumed.  Its got a nice clean smell.  I have a bottle of the expensive Peter Thomas Roth scrub but find that the philosophy brand actually holds together and you can feel the scrub.  There is no dripping.  This is truly a great rough exfoliator.  As for the warming sensation, I didnt feel it.  

Buy it at sephora where you can return it if you're not satisfied.

This stuff has the biggest "ying and yang" affect that I have ever witnessed with any Lush products so far...the good part about this is that is has eliminated my need to use a cream conditioner along with my shampoo bars that I usually buy from Lush and the smell really lingers in your hair for days...plus my hair seems shinier than usual...the bad is that, after a few days of use, the ends of my hair started to feel very dry and dehydrated and are splitting and also the smell...after you use the product and the day passes by the smell softens to a smell that's quite nice but when you first use it you get almost knocked over by a very overpowering smell of black licorice!!  I haven't decided if I will continue to use this product..I like the fact that the smell evens out and (eventually) makes my hair smell great but If I do still use it then I will most defintely go back to my cream conditioner

I was alittle hesitant at first...as this was my first LUSH experience, but was soon well rewarded. I have thick, curly, long color treated hair. So to say its damaged is an understatement. Hybrid worked major tho. I doesnt lather like your normal shampoo does, so I was concerned if it was really working. It does...have no fear. I have to use quiet a few swips tho, because of how much hair I have - but still - ive had this bar a month now, and can barely see where its been used. I store mine a traveling soap case and always let dry before closing and dont store in the shower. I still did need a condition afterwards, but not as much as normally. When dry...my hair just feels healthier and less frizzy, but not caked down.

I have had a problem with thinning hair for a while, and wasnt sure what to do about it. I heard from a couple of people that this line was quite good so I thought I would give it a try. I didn't get it from Amazon but a salon in my town. I actually wanted the shampoo for fine thinning hair (system one I think), and they didn't have any left. They told me that all of the Nioxin products were for thinning hair, and to try this one first.  

I have only been using it for a couple of weeks so I can't say for sure that it's regrowing any hair, but my hair looks thicker and it feels alot softer and a lot less greasy, more bouncy. I have noticed that my hair is not falling out and breaking as much also.  I really like the products and I am going to continue using them.

Before Stella came along, I was a Marc Jacobs girl.  I found Stella this month while reading magazines...normally, I hate perfume inserts as they give me a headache, but everytime I would open my magazine, I would wonder, what is that smell?  

I usually do not like rose-based scents, although I do like florals.  I bought a sample size of Stella and tested it on my husband.  I really think there's something in it that makes him crazy....he loves it, and he's not a big fan of perfume!  And I can't stop smelling my wrists....it's feminine without being girly, and "dark" without being musky.  I think it's a perfect scent for a professional woman

Ne Worry Pas is a clever little item with skin calming and moisturizing elements to make you feel good for at least 24 hours. Soya Milk, Bergamot oil, Jasmine and Cedarwood are lovely, but you may also want to add a few drops of lavender (Forces of Nature Organic French Lavender is a favorite) and Egyptian musk (an artificial one you can buy from Caswell-Massey). I also added a little bag of oatmeal, rosemary and two rooibos tea bags. I think I like this as much as Tisty Tosty or Dream On. This bath will make you silky soft all over and leave you delicately scented with delicious essential oils. Your skin will radiate the fragrance for about 24 hours. Alkmaar body soap seems perfect with this experience.

This bath bomb had the longest lasting scent of any Lush product I have used. In fact, I used it this morning and this evening when I got home, my bathroom still carried the scent. I can even smell it on my skin hours later! It also made a lovely, creamy white bath that was utterly calming and relaxing. I think I stayed in for an hour without the scent, look or feel of the bath changing at all (Except for the fact that my water got cold. Wouldn't it be great if Lush could make a product that would be make the warm water last as long as their scents?

Not only does this gel smell terrific, like real raspberry sorbet, it is functional as well.  This lathers up nice and you don't have to use a lot of product.  You use it as a body wash, a shampoo and a conditioner and I suppose for a bubble bath too.  So that makes it four in one.  I take this on trips because its easy to grab and put in my overnight bag and I can take less product with me. I also will use this when I'm running late and have to take a quick shower.  This also comes in many other yummy scents.  Try them and you will not be disappointed.

My title says it all. This smells so amazing, and is such a lush and fabulous lather, that I will never wash with any other soap again. I even bought the perfume because I found myself sniffing my arms all day long after a shower. 

It's fantastic, it's totally worth the money, and it lasts a long time. One bottle lasts me 2-3 months, bathing every day. I've even used this in my hair before... but it tends to dry out my hair a lot and I need a lot of moisture because I have blonded curly hair.

Of all the Philosophy line, I find that this is the best consistency-wise.  It's much thicker than the Amazing or Baby Grace gels, and leaves your hair and skin much softer, and smelling like Ivory soap.  Very clean scented, not too girly.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE the Blackberry Bath Bomb!!!!!  It turned my bath water a very pretty purple color and the smell was WONDERFUL!  I can't really describe it.  It didn't smell fruity to me at all but was very relaxing and soothing.  Once I got out of the tub the smell stayed on my skin for several hours.  When I was putting my daughter to bed she snuggled her head in my arm and just kept smelling.  We both laid there smelling my arms :)

This bath bomb was a little deceptive.  It fizzed fast and made the water a beautiful color.  It smelled great.  Then I thought, OK this will be enjoyable for about three minutes until I get used to the smell and the novelty of bathing in purple water wears off. 

Boy, was I wrong.  After a few minutes I started to feel sooooo much more relaxed.  I had already been bathing in plain, hot water for awhile, so it wasn't just the effects of a hot bath.  This little ballistic has something.  And my skin smelled great until I took a shower the next morning.

This is my favourite Lush bath bomb! It does everything you want a bath bomb to do - it smells great, a fruity (but not blackberry) scent, it turns the bathwater into a cool purple colour, and it fizzes lots! Also it's very relaxing which we can all do with these days. And in the end of the fizzing - you get a small surprise... Don't read this next bit if you want to find out for yourself. It's a little piece of paper that says "BOMB!"

I prefer the bubble bars because I like bubble baths and also they are more economical as you can break them up and use them for more than one bath, but sometimes throwing a whole bomb in is a treat in itself.

For a really indulgent experience, try 1/3 of a Creamy Candy bubble slice with the Blackberry bomb - it makes purple bubbles and smells so yummy. But only for those who like strong scented baths I think..

This bath bomb does not really smell like blackberry; nonetheless, it has a sweet, fruity smell that I cannot quite place my finger on. It smells a bit like grape Kool-Aid, but not as sweet or syrupy. The smell is not as strong as some of Lush's other bath bombs, but it is quite pleasant.

The bomb turns the bath water a wonderfully relaxing purple color. As with  most bath bombs from Lush, it will leave a ring around the tub. In order to remedy this, I usually wipe the tub down with my washcloth after I am done with my bath. Granted, this is not the way that one wants to cap off a relaxing bath, but it will save the agony of having to scrub the tub the following morning. 

The bomb turns the water quite soft and will leave your skin feeling delightfully supple. I was quite pleased with this aspect of the bomb. The scent it leaves on your skin is subtle and lasted for a couple of days.  This is definitely one of Lush's more simple bath bombs, but it is definitely not boring. The small surprise that accompanies the bomb somewhat compensates for the lack of glitter and more powerful floral/fruit scent. 

Not one of the more memorable bombs, but really quite pleasing. If you want to take a break from some of Lush's more overpowering products, this bomb is for you.

Blackkberry bath bomb is a treat for the senses. The fragrant oils in it soften your skin and smell rich and sensual. My house smelled great for a few days from towels and pajamas left scented after the bath. The water turns a purpley tea color. It is just lovely. Go for it!

I am in my 40s and have used Idealist since it was introduced.  It is the only moisturizer I've ever LOVED.  It truly makes my skin like silk.  It feels light going on, I can use it daytime or night, it never irritates or contributes to a breakout.  I use about 1.5 bottles a year, and while I'm generally thrifty with cosmetics and skin care, nothing cheap (or expensive) surpasses Idealist.

I use it w/ my Proactive and its making my skin beautiful.  They actually have a larger size which is a 2.5 oz which retails for 90 bucks.  I would recommened that one

I received about 100 tiny bottles of this from a neighbor...thought it was worth a shot. I'm 27 and have had problems with breakouts since I was a young teenager. Idealist made my skin baby soft, reduced the number of breakouts much better than Clearasil or any other anti-acne treatment did, and also evened out my complexion...I has less blotchiness. I absolutely love this stuff! But alas, I used up all the little bottles and I just can't seem to get myself to pay $40 or more for it...even as much as it worked. I just wish it wasn't that expensive

Rock Star is a creamy pink soap that produces and abundance of lather.  I've found it to be less drying than many other soaps, and less drying than certain of Lush's other soaps (the glycerin ones, like Bohemian and Sea Vegetable.)  While the creaminess is certainly an asset, it also means that the soap melts away quickly, as another reviewer mentioned.  As this is a somewhat expensive soap, more than $7 for about 3 oz., this is definitely something to consider before purchasing.  A bar of this soap lasts me about a week, showering every day.  Admittedly I'm a fairly enthusiastic user, and it's likely possible to use a bit less, but I'm not sure that would make a huge difference.  And this brings us to scent.  If you like sweet, candy-like scents, Rock Star is amazing.  It's very sweet, very pink, and very girly.  Overall, this has a lovely candy scent (the same as Lush's Creamy Candy bubble bar).  It's a bit of a hard scent to explain, but very much sweet and candy-like.  

Overall, this is a lovely, luxurious soap.  It is also an expensive soap.  These are the main benefits/drawbacks.  I gave it 5 stars because I love the scent and texture

Loves it. I love Lush soap products. The Rock Star soap is fragrant and that is what makes this product unique and fun.

Delivery of this item was quick. I hope to order from them again in the future

This perfume smells so good.  It is not too overbearing but it does not wear off easily either.
It is sort of sweet and light.  I got the sample from Macy's and i finished it ASAP and now I need the bottle! 

I love it

This is one of the best blotting papers. It does not interfere with my make-up because it has no powder at all and it absorbs oil from skin very well. This paper is rolled-up, so you can cut a piece of paper of the length you desire. I widely recommend this product. Thank you

Ok, if you weren't already aware, blotting papers are merely the same material you use to separate your bum and the public toilet. However, I am not inclined to stuff a few seat covers in my purse. Sephora has put their blotting papers on a mini roller in an attractive light blue container. This is better than other packaging options, where the too small papers are offered in kleenix-box style. Sephora's rolling sheet option allows you to take as much as you need, and offers an efficient cutting edge for easy tearing. Now that's what I'm talking about

I loved this bath bomb but it doesn't have a lot of "pow" so if that's what you are looking for, go elsewhere with this one.  In the middle is a hidden surprise which I did like - a tea bag.  I didn't think the scent was all that strong and the water wasn't exceptionally softer but it was an OK experience.  I don't know that I'd get it again though

So when your best friend calls and tells you she is off to Europe and can't stay and chat because she will miss her plane...what is a person to do? Well, hop into the bath with a little "Tea &amp; Sympathy" and call your new best friend. Tea and Sympathy is filled with soya milk, Calamine Powder, Clary Sage (lots and lots - so if you don't like this essential oil - it is very strong), Gardenia Oil, perfumes, Olibanum Oil, Chamomile and a Chamomile tea bag. Something about this particular product soothes the soul and all your problems go down the drain with the water. 

Of course, if you are feeling very wicked, you could always send this to a friend with the note: "Oh, darling, I'm off to Paris, sorry I didn't have time to call." Thankfully LUSH has a solution to every problem and if you like this product, you may also want to try Ne Worry Pas with sweet orange and tangerine. 

Some of my favorite finds include: "Butterball" with Ylang Ylang and Vanilla, "The Happy Pill" with delicious citrus oils and Bergamot, "Youki Hi" with exotic Jasmine and "Golden Slumbers" for a lovely sweet sleep. Looking for something romantic? Try "Romance in a Stone" with a love poem/note or "Tisty Tosty" which is like a love spell so powerful that your true love may even call you when you are in the tub.

Polite smell, with a hint, slight hint of sexiness only to be detected by someone who actually looks for it :) (not obvious).  Love this for travelling to warmer climates, great on the airplane.  For some reason I don't do well wearing this outside of travelling.  Like any perfume, the time of day it is, as well as the place on earth you are has a lot to do with it.  LOVE this... however it's not to be brandished for all occasions

White Linen is a classic fragrance for daytime use. It's fresh, crisp scent is perfect in summer, when heavier scents can "turn"
This was my first "young ladies" scent, and remains one of my favorites.

The other White Linen items: powder, body lotions and soaps are wonderful for layering this perfume. Because it is so light, you can't overdo it.

 With its crisp white and blue packaging, it makes a lovely gift for anyone

Why would anybody review a perfume?. In my case, this is the first time I have done that, and the reason to do so is to recommend it. "White linen" is simply wonderful. Am I exaggerating?. I don't think so...

Truth to be told, I didn't buy it for myself: it was a gift. Notwithstanding that, I have gone on buying it ever since that lucky day in which I discovered it. Why?. Well, because I like it, and due to the fact that it goes well with my personality. I know, that seems a strange explanation, but it is the truth. 

This perfume isn't new, in fact EstÃ©e Lauder created it in 1978, coincidently the year in which I was born. All the same, who needs a new perfume, specially when there is a old one that works so well?. This one includes, among other fragances, citrus, peach, jasmine, lilac, rose and amber. The result is unique, and very pleasant.

On the whole, I can say I recommend "White linen" for those who can appreciate a subtle but special perfume. If you want more words to describe it, I suppose I will have to look them up in my dictionary. But I guess the best course of action would be trying a sample of "White linen": then you will have no doubts of what I am talking about  :)

This is one of my favorite perumes. VERY romantic..just as the name implies. A scent a woman would wear for a sexy night out with her man..or to wear when getting married!! Reminds me of soft pink roses....but not overwhemlingmy "rose-y".... which is good.

This product really does what it says - it lifts and smooths, and conceals too.  It's the best concealer I've tried, and I've tried many.  One note though - the lightest shade is very light.  I have very fair skin and found it to be too white, so I exchanged it for the 2nd shade, which would also work well on fair to medium skin.

Great product

There I was waiting shaving my legs and the water in the tub was draining away when suddenly I looked down and noticed all these little glittery confetti hearts. So cute! That was a nice surprise and I didn't see them while I was taking a bath. I did see the little candy flowers floating about. 

This bath has a high "cuteness" factor and if you are in one of those "everything has to be pink" moods, then Think Pink may suit your candy mood. Lavender oil, Tonka absolute, vanilla and neroli oil makes this a calming bath that leaves you a little happier. You may enjoy this bath even more with the calming sweet "Honey I Washed the Kids Sweet Honey Soap" or the "Sultana of Soap" bar which is sumptuously smooth and leaves a fragrance on your skin that lasts all night. 

If you want a pink/vanilla soap, then you may want "Rock Star." If you are into mixing and matching according to scents, then the Trichomania is mildly scented with coconut and looks like a vanilla shampoo bar and it goes well with the vanilla scented American Cream conditioner. 

I vote for a tad more vanilla, although you can toss a little vanilla oil in the bath or some vanilla from the kitchen also works well. Eating sugar cookies in the tub is optional.

It turned the water a pretty pale pink, and I loved the heart confetti. Could have been more of it, though, and the scent could have been stronger. Still, I stayed in that bath for a long looooong time! :

Ohh, what a lovely product for the time most of us love; bath time.
This marvel melts into a soft pink Tonka Vanilla Bean scented bath that smells like a cake and makes you hungry for sweets!

This lovely product contains Pefume, Lavender Oil , Tonka Absolute, Vanilla Absolute, Neroli Oil , Pink Heart Confetti &amp; Candy Flowers!

At the end you have to flowers gliding through your bath water, small but adorable memory that lingers long after the pink bon bon has dissolved

This bomb has the lovely smell of a just opened bag of Valentine's conversation hearts.  It's a sort of vanilla that isn't overwhelming (actually it's Tonka).  The tiny paper heart confetti that fills your pink bath water just brings smiles to the face!  I didn't give it 5 stars due to the scent fizzling out once my bath ballistic was in the water

I have tried just about every over the counter face wash available. I found flaw with each one as they either dried my face out too much,or irratated my face,or just didnt clean my face enough.
This cleanser is the perfect answer! It is fragrant free,and doesnt dry out your face.The PHA gently exfoilates dead skin cells with no scrubbing and leaves face smooth and fresh.
It is an absolute must for those of us with oily and acne prone skin.My dermatologist reccomended it to me a year ago,and I will never go back to anything else again

This Goddess perfume has a clean,fresh scent,but wears off quite easily.Although it smells good,being Baby Phat,it is kinda pricey.But I adore Baby Phat and I'd say it's a nice choice.I'm so glad I got it for Christmas

This is a great great eyeliner! I have been on a quest to find an eyeliner that can last a whole day without smuding or clumping in the corners of my eyes and I have found it! It's not too pricey, either. If they ever discontinue this product, i'll be a very sad camper.....it's GREAT

This is a very concentrated, rich body gel.  You only need a little to get a lot of lather.  The smell is of raspberry as in the name of the product. You feel clean and fresh after you use this shower gel. It leaves no film on your skin.  It also leaves a light scent of the gel.  I've made the mistake of using too much and had to really wash it off.  This is a fantastic body wash and I highly recommend it.  Also try it out in the different scents, they are all heavenly

I absolutely love this lip gloss in sorbet.  It gives a nice shine with a hint of red and the subtle color goes with everything.  I wear it all the time and keep it in my purse.  (Please note that this lip gloss is not very long-wearing and needs to be reapplied during the day.

I have had acne since age 12, and though it's never been severe, I hate it. I've tried lots of over the counter products of various prices, and this is the first stuff I've used that works. However, (and this is a huge however) like most companies Philosophy assumes that acne prone skin is always oily skin. This is not so. My skin is very dry and sensitive, even in the areas where I am most likely to break out. I did notice when I bought the kit that it was likely to strip the oil from my skin, but I assumed that moisturizing would help with that. Not so. The acne cleared up nicely, but now I have a sizable (to me anyway) flaking patch next to one of my eyebrows.
I was using an aveno moisturizer after the h202 cream, and the blemish syrum only once a day (and that sparingly) but I am now going to try the Philosophy Hope in a Jar for Sensitive Skin and put it on after everything. Hopefully (no pun intended) this will help

I never had a problem with acne until my late 20s, when suddenly my skin seemed to turn on me. I found myself with bumps on my cheeks (where my skin was dry), around my nostrils (where my skin was super red and inflammed and raw looking), my nose (oily and prone to blackheads), and my forehead (also oily). I tried several high-end drugstore brands and none of them seemed to work. For months it was this way no matter what I did. I tried Proactiv, which dried my skin out horribly, and stung while I applied the products - I even used those products only every other day and my skin still peeled! I was all set to go to a dermatologist when I decided to give the Philosophy line a chance after hearing so many good things about it from family and friends. 

I've been using it religiously for two weeks, and while I can't say my skin is flawless, it's considerably improved. The bumps have gone down in every area, my nostrils are no longer red and unsightly, no more blackheads, and best of all it feels great while applying and after. Each product also has very little scent to it which I liked as well - no antiseptic smell here! I did find that the moisturizer wasn't quite enough for me so I started using Philosophy's Hope in a Jar for sensitive skin on my cheeks and neck. That and the fact that it cleared up my acne mostly but not completely are my reasons for giving it four stars rather than five.

Overall, I've very satisfied with the product and intend to continue using it for quite some time.

I bought this kit with low expectations.  Being in my 30's and having dealt with moderate acne problems since my early teens, I've literally tried everything.  

I've been using this kit for over a week, and I have definitely seen progress.  All of my existing blemishes cleared up much faster than usual, and I haven't seen any significant new breakouts.  

The only downfall is that this is a 4 step program which is a tad time consuming and tedious, but at this point I'm willing to do it if the results continue at this rate.  I also note that I need to put a top layer of moisturiser on my face as the protection creme doesn't do the trick to keep my skin from drying out in certain areas.  Which makes it actually a 5 step process.  

I've had short term success with other products in the past, so I'm only giving 4 stars for the good start. I am reserving judgement on the last star pending long-term results.  If the system continues to work for me I'll re-review

I'm addicted! My hair is naturally curly so when I straighten it it always feels dry and it looks dull. But this makes my hair so shiny and soft! I bought a 2 oz bottle at walgreens but I will be buying a much larger bottle when this is all gone! Go buy it! You won't regret it

I'm picky about my lipstick.  Not only does the shade have to be great (not garish or sparkly) but I want it to smell pleasant (or not at all), taste pleasant (or not at all) and I want the case to feel substantial and click when I close it.

OK -- so how does this one measure up?  The shades are awsome.  I like Baby Lips and Natural Lips.  It smells ok -- kind of like vasaline -- but only faintly.  Estee Lauder lipstick has a much stronger perfume smell and Lacome tends to smell fruity.  It tastes faintly like a chapstick.  The case is relatively heavy and it clicks.  Neither the taste nor the smell are off-putting but because I'm so picky it only gets 4 stars.  (The texture is smooth as well and it doesn't feel heavy on your lips.)

If you want natural (not sparkly) lips for everyday this is a good choice

I love trying new fragrances, and when I came across this yesterday and tried it on, - I became hooked instantly.  It's a beautiful perfume that is somewhat floral and fruity at the same time, but isn't too overpowering and for me, lasted quite a while.
The packaging is great.  It's fresh looking and pretty, but it's the fragrance itself that hooked me.  I got a few comments on it right away, so I think I'm going back to the store to buy some.  It might be a little too heavy for hot summer days, but perfect for winter.  I think this will definately suit cooler climates better, or if it's too hot, it will probably become sickly and too strong.  If you like the blend of fruit and floral, this is for you.  It's stunning and different.  I love it

While in Sephora planning to buy Fantasy By Britney Spears I came across the Armani Code. It was kinda hard to miss since there was this GIGANTIC Poster advertising it. So I thought there's no harm testing it right?? I sprayed a little bit on a test strip and fell IN LOVE with it. It smells amazing!!!! It mainly smells like Lavendar to me which is one of my favorite scent. It lasts for about maybe 4 hours so if you go to school or work you might need 1 or 2 refreshes. I spray about 2 squirts each. Also on the days that you want to try something different I recommand the Pink Sugar by Aquolina and Miracle Intense by Lancome

	Love all of the items in Laura Mercier's spring collection - Sheer Madness.  "Sheer" is the operative word here - the makeup is subtle, refined and very flattering.

	The stick gloss rates a ten and all A's from me.  What's not to like about a lip treatment that soothes, smooths, plus adds color and fullness?  Stick gloss is a combination of lip balm, lip color, and lip glaze - a three in one winner.

	My favorite colors are Peony, a deep rose, and Poppy, a festive crimson.   When applied each color is much sheerer than the tube color indicates.  For instance, the Peony appears to be a burgundy tone yet on the lips it is a lovely rose.

     Perfect warm weather tones.

I started college this year and because of my dorm's terrible softened water and the dry air that I wasn't exposed to at my home, my hair turned into a dry, frizzy mess. I came home at Christmas and had to have a foot taken off the bottom of my hair! (it needed a trimming anyway...but still) I still had two feet of damaged hair left. My mom gave me the Ojon Restorative Hair Treatment to use over my winter break and after just a few times using Ojon, my hair became smooth and silky again. Now I use Ojon about once every three weeks and my hair is in such better shape than it was before! When I use Ojon I usually sleep with it in, then wash it out in the morning. I find that it's most effective that way. I have to admit that the first time I used Ojon the strong smell gave me a headache, but now it doesn't give me headaches at all, in fact, I love the burnt chocolate/coffee smell that is has! I would recommend Ojon to anyone with long and or damaged hair. It is a wonderful product

I have always wanted to try Ojon Restorative Treatment and I finally bought it.  My hair has never looked or felt so good in years.  I color my hair and use a flat iron several times a week so it was so so dry.  I put it on last night left it in overnight.  I also got the shampoo and conditioner once I started brushing my wet hair I could tell that this stuff is good.  I will never buy anything other than Ojon again.  Truely it is the best

I've used others in the past, but they end up losing their concealment power in a short time, or end up making me look shinier. This one is easy to apply (it's like drawing on your face) and it stays on a long time. I really love it. :

Thanks to the coverage of PLAY STICKS, that is!  The coverage is significant for my emerging age spots, yet PLAY STICKS does  not look heavy, chalky or cakey at all. Using PLAY STICKS, my face looks like I am using  little make up, and it has a sheer look and dewey finish. PROBLELM:  Finding my color with online shopping!  It is out of stock and I don't live up North where the department stores carry BENEFIT!!!! It is so worth the effort!  I LOVE THIS FOUNDATION, and I have tried the regulars: Bobbie Brown, Este Lauder, Clinique, etc

This is the only foundation that I will ever use.  I have very oily skin with large pores.  My main problem was that 3 to 4 hours after I put on other foundations, my face would be so incredibly shiny it was gross.  Superfit does not do that.  It also doesn't make my skin break out.

Additionally, it's an exact color match.  I have brown skin and finding an exact color match was very difficult for me.  I use "nutty".

The only problem that I have with this foundation and why I didn't give it 5 stars is the fact that it will rub off on your clothing.  So careful, for those of you, who apply makeup before putting on clothing.

I love this shampoo. I havent been using it long enough to see a differece with hair growth, but it definitely leaves my hair clean. My hair actually feels stronger. And even though it states that it has oils in it, my fine hair is not weighed down at all. Leaves my hair shiny and feels good when massaged into the scalp. Helps with oiliness of the scalp. I love it

     Ever think about how much time most of us spend taking care of our skin?  We use potions, creams, and masks on our faces to keep complexions glowing but often neglect our hair save for a quick shampoo and blow dry.  Then, all of a sudden, we look in a mirror and realize these tresses need a treatment! 

     Let's face it, blow drying, hot rollers, curling irons, coloring, the sun all take their toll on even the healthiest of heads.  

     Hair Mask with Shea Butter is both a treat and a treatment for dry, lifeless, lusterless hair.  Shea Butter is, of course, the key ingredient, working its magic to restore lackadaisical locks.  

      It's simple - work a palm size dollop through damp hair and leave on for up to 20 minutes.  Then shampoo and rinse hair well.  I'd also recommend using Fekkai's Apple Cider Clearing Rinse.

       The results are immediate - what a difference you'll see and feel.

This product is AMAZING!!!  I did a lot of research before buying these and they certainly seemed like the best option for the price-definitely so!  They came soooo fast and the minute I used them I was floored!  I have a 32B chest and these inserts are awesome for giving me a little more volume without being overwhelming.  They feel incredibly natural too!  I can't express to you all how overjoyed I am and soooo happy that I chose to go with Takeouts.  I would recommend them to anyone looking for a boost!

Listen, I ran out of my bar soap, and all that was left was my wife's liquid stuff and this 'poofy' thing.  So I used it.  No big deal, right?  Except... except, I... I liked it...  I actually felt more clean.  Now I've got my own (white, if you must know), but I use some of the more manly liquid soaps to balance things out.

I've since learned that the extra clean feeling was due to something called 'exfoliation'.  You should pick up a copy of Seventeen Magazine if you want more info

If I could pick one lip gloss to use for the rest of my life, it would easily be this.  (And as a lip gloss junkie, that's saying a lot.)  It tastes fantastic, smells equally amazing, and shimmers on your lips.  Plus, its decadent tint gives your pout added sheen and mixes well with any complexion.  The best lip gloss you'll ever buy

I got these in the mail today and I was very excited. The packaging is very thin and sleek (soft rubber) which is a bonus since I hate being able to feel those hard packages in my purse. Now, the sheets are very good. The only thing is that they're a bit too rough (for my taste), but they remove the oil and leave a transparent powder on your skin. The powder doesn't even come off of the sheet until it hits the oil! Really neat. Plus,the powder actually stays on my skin for a while, about an hour (I have combination skin; that might be why), so I won't look all icky and shiny. If you have sensitive skin, these might bother you a bit but they DO work very well, a lot better than any I have ever tried.

I've got pretty oily skin - I always have.  These are my absolute favorite oil blotting sheets.  I've tried a wide assortment of other brands, and the Shiseido ones are truly the best.  I really like the light powder on the sheets.  You know it's absorbing without leaving tons of make-up left on your face.

I DETEST those oil blotting sheets which are "rubbery".  Hopefully you know what I'm referrring to.  I don't feel like those sheets actually absorb anything - more like push the oil around.  

After using this product you can visably see all of the oil and grime REMOVED from your face.  I haven't found anything I like better than these.  5 Stars

I have very oily skin, and I like to go powder-free in the summer. These tissues work great, they are the best tissues I have tried and the price is good.

Oil Absorbtion - absorbs LOTS of oil. And believe me, I have a lot.

Powder - There is a little powder on the tissue, and it's light blue. Maybe to make sallow complexions look less sallow? Anyway, it goes away after a few minutes, but it makes my skin nice and non-oily.

Portable - Nice lil foldover packet to take anywhere.

I recommend these tissues for any woman with very oily skin. I use them in the winter and summer. They work better than napkins, are more conveneint that face washing and are a great value for the price

This lip gloss is amazing. It's not sticky  but it doesn't wear off fast, and comes in fantastic flavours. My favourite is Coconut flavour as its smells and tastes like coconut oil which I use at the beach therefore reminding me of the hot beach! Its also really fun to wear. The coconut colour is a hot pink but don't be fooled, It does not come out hot pink on your lips, it comes out a nice light sparkely pink! Its fantastic and my favourite lip gloss ever! the packaging is really cool and its cheap unlike most things!!! Quality buy

Burberry London is definitely a compliment-getter.  It's also versatile, as it can be worn in any weather and with any outfit.  It has notes of peach, black currant, vanilla, and cedar.  

Please do not judge this scent by only sniffing the nozzle or smelling a scent strip of paper.  It smells NOTHING like it does on skin.  Allow it to settle for 5 minutes, and if it works with your body chemistry, you'll know right away. :o)  At first sprtiz, I get a peachy/cedar blast that quickly mellows into a gorgeous, clean, but warm scent.  The vanilla isn't sweet at all.. just warm and inviting.  I have received a lot of compliments on this.

The lasting power is wonderful!  By the end of the day, it can only be sniffed by anyone who gets close to you, but it has developed into a super soft, clean vanilla.  Burberry London can be expensive, but there are lots of places where you can find great deals on it.  The bottle is very sophisticated, simple, and classy.

Try it!

I was really surprised by this one. I'd seen all the hoopla surrounding Burberry's other fragrance, Brit, and yet I found it too heavy. This one, however, is wonderful. It's not too much of anything. It's got a wonderful clean, modern scent that is very easy to wear year round and I've gotten lots of compliments. This is a good everyday scent that will allow you to smell wonderful without intruding upon others.

This product is great, and I love it.  Unfortunately, I bought the wrong color.  It make my eyebrows look entirely TOO dark.  It's really hard to see what the color is online, and I couldn't decide which color to buy.  So I bought the dark blonde color, and had to go back to get the pale blonde one.  If your hair is in between the two colors, go with the lighter one

I have ash brown hair with a few blonde highlights and found the dark blonde/medium brown color very natural.  I used Sephora's slanted eyeshadow brush to apply and was very happy with the results.  It's so much better than the Lancome pencil I used to use

I just received my buxom lips in the mail today. Cute packaging! Generous amount of product, too. I only wish I had picked a different color. I dont think the "color swatch" online is all that accurate. I'd buy it again though..even though its a little pricey. I trust the Bare Escentuals line and own a LOT of their products.  It tingles, and thats kind of a sexy feeling! Lisa in CT

I'm so glad that BE finally came out with this gloss.  My sister got this in a gift set.  I wanted my own (just the gloss) and I got it off of ebay.  This gloss smells like chocolate, the color is subtle, and it makes your lips tingle.  The color doesn't last as long as I would like but my lips look great with Dolly and they are soft when I'm not using this

sadly i bought this product because i heard jennifer lopez uses it, i have no idea if that is the truth but i wanted it anyway. i live in the uk, so the delivery took about three weeks, that said , the wait was worth it. i am twenty five with bad crows feet, due to late nights and alcohol a plenty, so i really did need something to help me out. after a few days of applying day and night i could tell that the lines had softened, enough to make me feel good.the dark circles under my eyes are looking lighter as well so that's a bonus. i dont think this is going to make my lines dissapear but they are hardly noticeable anymore. the cost of the product doesn'y seem that steep as the cream will last for ages, i only use a tiny drop and it's twice the size of normal eye cream's you can buy. overall i am more than pleased with the result's and i will definately be purchasing more, when the time comes.

I purchased this conditioner after having used the Fekkai color-treated (the pink one) version thinking it would be even better for my high-lighted and damaged hair.  While it is still a fantastic conditioner compared to most on the market, I really thought that the pink one did a better job.  Both leave my hair smooth and relatively healthy, but my hair is honestly gorgeous after using the pink Fekkai conditioner--shiny, bouncy, like I never colored it.  Maybe this one is a little too heavy for my hair?  I haven't quite figured out the difference.  

As previous posters have noted, this does have a rather strong smell--sort of a floral, almond fragrance--which is a little stronger than most hair products.  I didn't find it particually off-putting, but I do prefer the clean, simple fragrance of the pink Fekkai conditioner.

All in all, a great product, but I'll go back to my original Fekkai conditioner when this one runs out.  I never thought I would say this about a $20 tiny bottle of conditioner, but it's totally worth the $$.(For comparison purposes, I have medium-length, straight, dirty blonde hair with highlights)

Okay, I know fragrance is a personal preference. This shampoo and the conditioner and hair treatment mask have done wonderful things for my damaged hair. However, I hate the smell. It has a very heavy fragrance that I can only describe as being like incense or myrhh. Very overpowering and gives me a headache. I prefer my hair products to have light, clean, fresh scents that won't interfere with my perfume and won't give me a headache. Thus, only 4 stars. I wish the people at Fekkai would consider changing the fragrance for this product line to something less intrusive

I received a sample of this from Sephora, when I bought another Fekkai product.  I couldn't believe it when I tried it.  It's wonderful, it smells great(my boyfriend loved it), it got my hair really clean and left it soft and with some body, not limp and greasy feeling.  I will only use Fekkai products from now on, they really are the best for your hair

DHT is something I first learned about from my research online when looking for a new shampoo.  There is a good amount info out there but not a whole lot of DHT shampoo companies that I could find.  All I found was revivogen and min for DHT shampoo.  I would not use revivogen because, frankly, I think it looks terrible and don't want to have to hide my shampoo when my girlfriend stays over:)  I bought the min DHT Shampoo cleasng and I am quite impressed.  I was also very impressed with how fast they delivered it (2 days!).

I don't know why its sooooo hard for companies to make a shampoo cleanser and conditioner that dont weigh hair down, strip hair, make scalp itch, etc etc.  BUT these guys finally figured it out.  No problems with this product line and have been using it for almost three months now.  I recommend it highly and it also looks great in the shower fyi

I absolutely love this stuff!  I purchased it along with the Bare Minerals starter kit (foundation powders w/ DVD &amp; all) because I wanted some color to add to the foundation.  I think it's worth your money - actually you would save money rather than buying all items separately.  It's nice that you get your eye, cheek and lip products all in one kit.  I particularly like the Buxom Lips stuff and can't get enough of it!  It's so minty, tingly and leaves a light shimmer.  The Clear Radiance is great!  I use it as a blusher, and if I wet it it makes a great eye shadow base.  The eyeshadow brush is FABULOUS!  I like how there's two ends - one for eyeliner, the other for shadow, although I also use the eyeliner brush for eyeshadow.  The gold glimmer is great and if you wet it comes on stronger.  My only concern is it does get messy - particularly with the onyx color which comes on strong so can only use very little.  Otherwise I think it's a great buy!

 I saw this at a local Dept.store, and was quite intrigued by the unique packaging, and name. I sprayed myself with the tester bottle, and LOVED it, straightaway! My Hubby got it for me for Valentine's Day, and I use it faithfully. It has a fresh,crisp, green apple aroma to it. Not too light, yet not too overpowering.Perfect balance.Very girly.Reminds me of a walk in an apple orchard, on an autumn day. A good way to get your apple-a-day

I've always had really dry, chapped lips and was always putting on lip balm under my lipstick, before bed, and probably a million times throughout the day.  But nothing seemed to help...lipstick always seemed to dry them out even more and nothing looks worse than dry lips with lipstick on.  It just makes your lips look even drier.  Buzz Latte Lip balm is the most amazing product ever!!!  It smells like coffee really strong at first but then goes away.  It doesnt taste bad either.  Yes, its $8 bucks for a tube...but the tube is twice the size of normal chapsticks so the cost evens out.  This product lasts forever...why?  Because it stays on so long...even with lipstick or lip glosses.  The first time i put this on was when I tried a friends.  Within hours i noticed a dramatic  difference so I went out and bought my own.    My lips have NEVER been so smooth and full.    Bare Escentuals continues to suprise me with all of their products!!! I dont think I will every try another makeup line.  I think what makes this product work so well is that its got a lot of shea butter in it.  But this product is amazing!  You can even dip it in bare escentuals blushes or eyeshadows and create a matching lipstick.  This is an absolute MUST for any makeup collection or anyone who suffers from dry, chapped lips.  You wont be sorry....you'll notice a difference right away

Extreme caution must be taken if you intend to use this product on your face or neck. The label reccomends not to, however With my sensative skin, I have not exeprienced any negative side effects. Worth the price of admission

Like many other oil strips, this locks up all the oil on your face without removing any makeup.  This is perfect for those with oily skin like mine, who need to blot often.

Although I'm sure there are cheaper brands that would do the same, when you blot with these sheets it seems to last longer than others I have used.

Check out your Sephora stores, sometimes they sell them 2 for $10

Yes, this is just water, but packaged wonderfully.  I have very dry, sensitive skin, and the little Evian spritzers (I carry one with me all the time in the winter) help immeasurably.  I spray a little on before moisturizing, or when my skin is flaking.  I always take these on planes--and spritz my face every two hours--and find that this keeps my skin from drying out and from becoming too oily (in reaction to the dryness) on long flights.

Some reviewers have scoffed at this product, pointing out that it's just water and speculating that the brand name is the draw.  I don't drink Evian water very often (I prefer other brands, if I'm drinking bottled water), and if I could find a comparable product I would definitely try it out.  Similar products, like the Body Shop face mists, tend to be scented and irritate my (very sensitive) skin (the exception to this is the face spritz from the Boots Botanical line, but that is hard to find outside of the UK); I've considered just getting a spray bottle and putting regular water in it, but those tend to have larger, more forceful sprayers and I don't want to point one at my face.

With the Evian brumisateur, you're getting just water, but that's all you need; it's conveniently packaged, lasts a long time for such a small bottle, and I love the way it feels.  Highly reccomended (and thank goodness they're carry-on approved, if you buy the small size!

I do love this fragrance but even when I layer the Falling In Love body wash, body lotion and the perfume spray, it does seem to fade a lot faster than other perfumes. Falling in Love is a really great scent so when I do wear it - I will continue to refresh the scent with an occasional spritz throughout the day.

iv'e been using shear splendor marinade for a month and it is making my hair softer, shinier and healthy looking.  i dont usually style my hair(rollers, blowdry etc.) only when i go out. Since I've been using the marinade my boyfriend always thinks i've been to the salon.  It really is great.  the shear splendor shampoo and conditioner are ok nothing more than just what it is.  But this marinade really works.  Try the 2 oz trial  size in the kit. Ive used it for 4 weeks and I still have more than half the bottle left and my hair is down to my waist

This hair oil is amazing! My hair was severely damaged from bleaching, dying, chemical straightening, and heat styling. I've tried everything from cheap store brands to salon products to repair my dry, brittle hair; but nothing has made any real difference until now. Philosophy Marinating Oil has brought my hair back to life! After just one use it was softer, smoother, less dry, and much, much heathier looking. I have been using it for about a month now and my hair looks better than it did before I started dying and straightening it. This product is worth the money

Don't be afraid of the word "oil". This treatment reversed years of damage from my color-treated very long hair after the first use. I love Philosophy products so when I heard about Shear Splendor I didn't hesitate and purchased the entire system. The shampoo and conditioner are the best things I have ever done for my hair. The effects are cumulative and after a few months of continued use, I'm still impressed. I use the Marinating Oil once a week and it's now a "must have" for me.  

The "Marinating" Oil is not what you might imagine an "oil" to be. It penetrates the hair, treats the scalp, smells really good (very subtle) and doesn't feel heavy. It's easy to leave in all night, washes out so quickly and it's instant gratification - beautiful hair. 

Leave it to a great skin care company to apply beneficial treatment properties to hair care.  

This Marinating Oil also multi-tasks for me. I use a tiny bit and rub it into my cuticles and nails.  I use a few drops to tame frizz before I use my flat-iron. I've rubbed a few drops onto my hands and feet when I've felt extra-dry.  This is good stuff!

I highly praise this product.  This is not just another random addition to the confusing mass of hair care lines.  This is serious *treatment* that won't be put on the shelf with the rest of the "things I've tried".

It's worth it. I actually love my hair again.  My color lasts longer, doesn't fade, and the shine just won't quit.  It's taken years and years of damage away.

I can blow-dry, flat-iron, curl... without the fry-factor.  

The shampoo and conditioner last forever. A little really does go a long, long way.

Thank you again Philosophy, you've yet to let me down.

My hairstylist accidentally bleached my hair too much. As if that wasn't bad enough, by the end of that week I noticed my hair was visibly dryer and had lost its shine. I used this "Marinating" oil overnight - slept in a plastic shower cap. I was surprised how easily it washed out in the morning. There was no "oily" residue weighing my hair down either. I was very impressed with the results, it put shine and body back in my hair - and I've only used it once, as they recommend overnight treatments once a week - I'm expecting even better results by the end of the month. I'd definetly recommend this product.

I absolutely love Clinique for eye shadow. All of their eye shadows go on so smooth, never crease, and are just the perfect shades of colors for my skin tone. The Almost Peach color is great because I can use it as a highlighter under my brow or just as a base, either way I use it just about every day!  :

Zeno works!  It is simple.  Hold the device on a new forming pimple and - zap! - It's gone.  It usually reduces in size immediately and is completely gone in 24 hrs - really remarkable.  Also - no chemicals - that is important to me.  

I hope this company goes public - I've never seen anything like it - so no competition!

Use it and loose it - the pimples - I mean

The Zeno is fantastic.  In 1 minute your "blemish" is gone.  I don't have to use all those "deep pore cleansers" anymore.  All you do is hold the "Zeno" on your pimple for 1 minute and it's gone.  My 15 year old kept borrowing mine, so I got a second one!
This is the best invention for anyone with pimples.  I love it.

"Strivectin-SD is much less expensive than surgery, but it's not cheap. Finally, for maxium efficacy, StriVectin-SD must be applied three times a day, every day for 4-6 weeks...StriVectin-SD works, but you have to use it. So unless you're committed to getting rid of stretch marks, don't waste your time, your energy, or your money." 

After months of thinking about an incredibly large skin care purchase, I splurged and purchased the StriVectin-SD cream. If you have ever gained and lost weight or have been pregnant, then you know that you can get stretch marks and they never seem to go away. How do you heal your skin so they literally disappear? Well, to start with, you need a cream that will produce dramatic results in a short amount of time. Especially as summer is approaching. 

I gave this cream a one-month trial. You need very little because this cream is very concentrated. It seems to increase the skin's thickness and firmness, therefore making the depths of indented surfaces much less apparent. 

Results you should see in 4-6 weeks: 

Decrease in the actual length of the stretch mark 
Decrease in the depth of the indented surfaces 
Increase in skin smoothness, thickness and firmness 

What is actually occurring? 

The cream stimulates glycosaminoglycan and collagen synthesis. It will also correct irregularities in skin coloration. The Peptide solution helps to thicken the skin. 

How often did I apply this? 

Just one to two times a day. At first I tried to apply the cream three times a day, but found it was easier to remember to put this cream on after a shower and/or before bed. It seems to work very well with only two applications a day. 

You may also find yourself using this on your face or on areas where you want to see a decrease in wrinkles. 

Not for use by pregnant or nursing women. Consult with your dermatologist before using this product. Do ask your doctor if this product is right for you and start using it as soon as possible after pregnancy/nursing. You will be amazed at the results after 1 month. My main reason for using this product was due to weight gain and monthly weight gain. It seems to have been very effective and I will continue using the product over the long term for maintenance. 

The ingredient list is long (a proprietary combination of skin firming agents, elasticizers and hydrators) but some of the main ingredients include: Sesame oil, sweet almond oil, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3, Algae Extract, Coneflower Extract, Licorice, Cocoa Butter, Shea Butter, Mango Butter, Peppermint Oil and retinyl Palmitate. 

This product has been clinically proven to dramatically reduce stretch marks and you will find many additional uses for this product. Is it better than Botox? I have never used Botox, but I can say there was a definite reduction in facial wrinkles after a month of use on two main areas of my face. 

What else does this product promise? It will reduce acne scars, burn scars, chicken pox marks and scars from old injuries. If you are looking for even faster results, go to your local esthetician and have a microdermabrasion peel. That will help this product absorb better and you will see even faster results. 

I also just found the Derma E Peptides Plus Double-Action Wrinkle Reverse Creme. It also has the Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3 and is perfect for use on your face if you are allergic to nut oils like almond oil. Once you realize the benefits of this ingredient, you will start to recognize the name in many skin products. 

I would love to see them make this product in an oil-free formula for oily skin or at least a formula you could use all over your face if you have oily skin. Use sparingly and you shouldn't have a problem and it is great for areas of dry skin. 

I now enjoy using this product on my body and the Derma E Peptides Plus product on my face.

I was hesitant to spend this amount and not see results. Well, the proof is in the pudding, so to speak. StriVectin WORKS. As I was much heavier at one point in my life, I had stretch marks to show for it. While they never really bothered me before, I thought I'd give it a try, with summer around the corner. I'm at just about 3 weeks of use and they are FADING. Literally. While they haven't vanished completely yet, I am quite happy with the results. They have drastically faded so far, and have lost that 'silvery' look of before. They recommend using this product up to 6 weeks and I plan on doing just that. Simple and easy. And guess what? You can even use this product on your face! They make the claim that it's "Better than Botox" and I would agree. Something you normally do, like putting on lotion is far healthier, simpler and saner. Although it doesn't bother me; the minty scent could bother some people on their face and hence they've released the non frangrant eye creme. LOVE this product

I purchased this comb in the hopes that it would be gentle enough on my fine hair to reduce hair loss and breakage.  After showering, I comb through my towel-dryed hair to prior to styling.  This comb detangles well, although the process is much easier if I've used a good conditioner.  I still experience a lot of hair loss, so I'm not sure if the comb has helped in this area, but my breakage from combing appears to be minimal.  Overall, I'm happy with this product, which has performed well for almost 5 years of daily usage

I am in love with this product.  It smells fantastic - like fresh juicy tangerines/oranges.  It is my favorite scent from the Body Shop.  Equally important, however, is the fact that it is a great shower gel in general.  It leaves no residue at all, and I never feel sticky after using it, as I sometimes do with other scented shower gels.  I always feel squeaky clean and fresh. The consistency of the gel is fairly thin (more like a liquid than a gel), which some reviewers have said they didn't like, but I actually prefer this type of shower gel, and wanted to point out that it is still a very saturated smell, and is not a "watered down" smell at all.  I give this product a very high recommendation.  If you like the scent of fresh juicy oranges, you should definitely try this product.

This powder is great. It has great coverage without looking cakey. I also have sensitive skin and this has never bothered me. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's still a little dark for very light skin and it needs to be "touched-up" a little more often than other powders I've tried, but it's worth it

I got a mini bottle of Cinnamon Buns in a philosophy.com order, and I was surprised how much I liked, since I'm not a huge cinnamon fan. 
I use the 3-in1's when I travel, and I find it depends on the local water whether or not I need extra conditioner, so I bring a bottle of leave in conditioner with me.  The philosophy shower gels really do a nice job of not drying out my already dryish skin, and my hair is always super shiny when I use philosophy 3-in 1.  
That said, this is one of the best smelling philosophy shower gels, and if you're looking for a deal, QVC sells 32oz of several of the philosopy  shower gels ( including cinnamon buns) for $22.00 to $24.0

After trying pure and amazing grace, I have to say that Baby Grace has quickly become my signature scent. It smells sweet and a little flowery. But I really don't see how it smells like a baby! But the only problem is the staying power! It barely lasts a few hours on my skin. I think I'm going to start layering with the matching wash and lotion

If you're looking for the best scissortweezers, look no further. The construction is impeccable and the feel is very solid. I went thru other brands and makes and came across Sephora's own model - very bad. They sell Tweezerman products, but they do not sell this particular model due to the fact that they sell their own flimsy alternative.

Do not substitute this for other products. The price is unbelievably expensive, but once you get hold of it you will understand. You will only buy it once and this will last more than a lifetime

I love this towel.  I'm a small person with shoulder length hair.  I take this in my gym bag and use it to dry my hair and entire body.  It is so small and light that it takes up no space in my gym bag compared with a big bath towel.  It's very absorbent.  My one disappointment is that I have to dry it separately, because fabric softener ruins the absorbency

This product is described as an anti-ager, but I've noticed in the year or so I've used that it works wonders on any number of skin imperfections. It is moisturizing but not at all greasy. It has dramatically reduced my breakouts and has noticeably evened out the skin tone on my chin. It contains an ingredient to "help minimize facial hair growth" and since using it I've been able to reduce my number of lip waxes. It has very little scent and is easy to smooth on. If I had one suggestion to make, it would be that Philosophy sell it in larger bottles as one bottle generally only lasts me about a month.

I'm typing the same review for all of the philosophy products I own since I don't know what is doing it so I'm assuming its all of them..... BUT my skin looks and feels ** FABULOUS ** I have a tendancy to pick at any small thing on my face, which I hate b/c you know you shouldn't do that. Anyway, I haven't had anything to pick at. This relationship is working out well. PLUS, "Falling in Love" and "Amazing Grace" fragrances that they sell, smell AWESOME, LOVE THEM and of course, RECOMMEND THEM !!

The Chisel Brush works well for all-over.  Actually, it was better than that - it swept over everything on my skin without depositing powder unevenly. That's rare for a brush. Usually you have to spend some time with a sponge or fingertips blending, but not with this.

The light cream powder, named the 4-in-1 foundation, provides excellent coverage without being thick.  (Thick powder base is terrible - it always looks like you dunked your face in a bowl of flour!) My freckles are still there, but my skintone is more even. This stuff is concealer, foundation, powder, and SPF protection. Awesome. So much easier than doing everything separately! And no oil, talc, alcohol, fragrance, chemical dyes, or preservatives, but what it does have is Vitamin E and Shea Butter. 

The Universal Marble Powder spreads into a tint that looks fairly natural - sun-kissed perhaps. It did need darkening with the darker powder - at least for me. But only a touch.

The Mineral Glow didn't go on as dark as it looked either. I was actually kind of surprised with this one - most dark powders end up everywhere if you try to shade them out...or impressively dark in one location if you don't. This wasn't like that at all, though I think I'd like a darker color for eyeshadow accents.

And some mascara...and eyeliner...and..and..and.

Large pores are not a good thing, and many products I have tried do little to help.  I used to just use the silicone gel I apply as a makeup base in the troubled area around my nose, but now I have found Clinique Pore Minimizer and find it much more effective.  I find my pores to appear much less visible when using this product, and it does not clog up my complexion and cause breakouts

I have tried (and been disappointed by) several make-up primers (Sephora, Philosophy, etc.) when I decided to try this. I have very oily skin with large pores around my nose and on my forehead but using this product with a tinted moisturizer makes my skin look naturally perfect! 
My skin stays shine-free well into the afternoon (I still end up using blotting tissues- it says you can use this one top of make-up, but applying it causes smearing)
Overall, I couldn't be happier

For years, I was paying more for an imported French mattifier and was devastated when the company stopped selling here. I tried other popular mattifiers (namely Smashbox's Photo Finish), but this was by far the best. Turns out it was a good thing I was forced to find another product. This product makes my shine and the huge pores on my cheeks just vanish.  I'm matte longer during the day, and since blush sticks to this product well, I don't need foundation. I'd recommend it to anyone that wants their skin surface to look smoother and less shiny. I'm not a huge fan of Clinique's in general, but this one product keeps me coming back

Clinique's "Pore Minimizer Instant Perfector" does indeed change the appearance of your skin.  It is incredibly light, just a touch glides on and your pores disappear in an instant.  You can wear it alone or under regular make-up for even more coverage.  I really think this is a great product and it does just what it says it will.  I recommend you use it with no more than a light moisturizer or else it won't be able to get in your pores to work its magic

This shaving gel is terrific! It is not for sensitive skin, as the shave it provides is very close, so it might irritate for those sensitive skin types. It doesn't clog your razor, and a little definitely goes a long way! The only reason I gave it four stars out of five, is because it goes on rather clear, so you really can't see the shave lines, so when shaving my legs, I have to feel for it, but other than that, it's absolutely fantastic, and I highly recommend!

Not everyone wants to smell sexy I guess, which is why I caved in and gave the 5 starts for the DELICIOUS smell...no one mentioned this but the overall smell reminds me of coconut.  I recognize this perfume on other people and it always distracts me (in a good way).  I would not wear this myself though.  Best in winter.... it'd be annoying in spring/summer.  Now a perfume in which a person NOT wear yet still give it 5 stars has got to be something special :).  Only one other perfume does that to me, Amairage I think...would never wear it, but I enjoy the smell on others

I have been using Lancome moisturizers for many years and every time I try another brand I come right back to Lancome, especially the Resolution D-Contraxol Anti-wrinkle Treatment. (They have updated/renamed this product a few times over the years but apparently only to add some new ingredients - the texture and effects are consistent and I believe better). 

I havent found another moisutrizer that has the same feel as this one- its light and easy to blend and lets your skin breathe so you don't feel "coated" in a thick film. I have found that it makes my makeup go on better and more evenly since its absorbs right into the skin and makes it smoother. It truly makes my otherwise dull skin glow! 

I can't really testify to the anti-wrinkle claims because I'm too young to have wrinkles and wear SPF 60 every time I leave the house, but hopefully its working! My only complaint is that it doesn't have a high SPF protection, but I think adding it would totally change the product and make it thicker, thereby negating all its wonderful attributes. Therefore, I HIGHLY recommend using it twice daily (or once if you prefer a different nighttime one) and adding a high SPF on top to prevent skin damage.

Resolution feels wonderfully luxurious on the skin and is relatively economical in that you need only a little for your whole face and neck - the regular size pot lasts me about two months.  It leaves you with super soft feeling and "pampered" skin, and you can apply makeup rightaway.  As for the promised anti-wrinkle effect, I am not too sure. I think a great deal of the effect is a kind of temporary plumping or masking of wrinkles immediately after application which fades after a couple of hours, especially with makeup on.  But overall, I think it helps keep the skin somehow glowing and I am quite satisfied with this as a nice quality day and night cream for someone my age (slightly younger-looking 37).  Maybe I should also mention that I am quite prone to allergies and sensitive reactions and haven't noticed any adversities with this products in about two years of use

Upon initial word of the Sean John cologne my first inclination was to avoid it.  I figured it would be another lousy celebrity fragrance.  However, after sampling in it I was blown away.  This is by far my favorite cologne I've ever bought.  I highly recommended it

       Ever dream of living on a beautiful tropical island?  Of course, you have.  (Well, maybe not being in residence  forever but perhaps a week away from the 9 to 5 commute would be nice).

	And since we're dreaming there's also a handsome sea captain on the island.  He thinks you're the most beautiful woman he's ever seen - he exclaims about the perfection of  your eyes , your hair, your lips, your hair, your skin, your hair, your face, your hair.

	Wait a minute, what's this fixation he has with your hair?  Ah, it must be the Coolaulin you use, that amazing fresh-from-the-tree coconut conditioner that leaves your hair shiny, soft, and smelling delicious.  

	You should have known!   Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief, sea captain - no man can resist hair treated with Coolaulin.

Smelled like coconuts, but what kept it from sweetness, is it kind of ends up falling off with a bit of a musk.I would've preferred if it didn't have the musk mixed in.The musk unbalances the sweetness of it

The only problem with these cotton squares is that once you use them you won't want to use the ones from the drug store ever again.  They are a good size so they can be cut in half to economize (depending on what you use them for). Nicely boxed

I love this product and can't recommend it highly enough, especially if you love margaritas.  I love the whole 3 in 1 idea: however, I have sensitive skin and very dry hair so I can only use it as a bath gel.  Unless you have normal, perpetually shiny hair and perfect skin I would look elsewhere for hair and face products

Unlike most Lush ballistics, the Happy Pill will foam, rather than fizz.  The two halves smell like Olive Branch gel and Happy Hippy gel, orange and grapefruit.  If it's taking too long to foam, you can break it in half.

Moisturizing and calming, I enjoy this long-lasting, citrus ballistic

I love LUSH Bath Bombs, and this one is a HUGE disc-shaped, awesome smelling product!

A friend in Germany sent me a package with several LUSH items and I couldn't believe how LARGE this bomb was. (I had only tried the round ones before.)

I didn't want to waste it all on one bath so I broke it in half. For those unfamiliar with Bath Bombs, they are made of sodium bicarbonate which means they're like luxury "alka seltzers" for the bath.

The Happy Pill bomb took awhile to dissolve (unlike the round ones) but I was glad for the lingering scent--a delicious fruity aroma.

Highly recommended if you want to get away from it all and have a spa experience in your own bathtub

I was browsing the Bath and Body Works store and saw it, opened up the "Tester" bottle and it smelled devine!  I know it is pricey, but I have thick, straight hair that has recently become very oily, even though I do not use any products.  The first day I used it, I washed my hair and blow dryed it, thinking the smell would not last long.  WRONG!  It happened to be raining that day and when my hair would get wet, that nice apple smell came back.  My hair is very soft and bouncy.  I purchased the 18 oz bottle (yes, sure is pricey) and so far I've used it every day (about a week).  I will try to taper off to maybe 3 days a week, in order to conserve product.  It's a keeper

Glamorous, mysterious, seductive all describe Armani Code, a captivating orange blossom based scent from Giorgio Armani Fragrance. 

As one would expect from this master couturier the bottle itself is a gem. Tapering from a weighted base the slim flacon seems to glow as lacquered shades of blue sweep from an early dawn at the bottom of the sleek holder to midnight nearing the top. Adding to the fragrance's intrigue is an oriental effect achieved by lace embroidery on the glass. 

The scent is sweet yet sensuous with a sparkle provided by orange zest. With orange blossom at its heart Armani Code is enhanced by Sambac jasmine, Madagascan vanilla and honey. The man in my life called it "delicious," and I do, too. It's now high on my list of favorite fragrances.

Even though this scrub reminds me of the teenage days, when the skin would act as if it was being attacked by my own face, trying to get away, I still love using it to fight occasional blemishes. There is nothing this mighty warrior cannot do when it comes to cleansing and purging the skin of clogged pores and dry patches. I don't suggest treating the face like a floor, scrubbing away until the polish wears off, but a good scrub at least once a week for normal to oily skin is not only beneficial but also very relaxing and let me just say that the scent itself makes me feel healthier all ready. I still get this, not only because of my fond memories but for it's ability to perk up and refresh my skin, especially before a mask on a Sunday night right before bed. I love the fresh piney scent of the scrub and its creamy consistency marred with real ground tea leaves.

Tea Tree is found in parts of South East Asia, New Zealand and Australia. The small shrub can survive in places where other vegetation fails to flourish. There are over a hundred eighty species of tea tree, only the oil steam-distilled from the single species of Melaleuca alternifolia is used commercially and it's only found in Northern New South Wales. Since it's discovery the oil has been called a first aid kit in a bottle, not used a moisturizer but as a deep cleanser and antiseptic it's also used to treat pimples, burns, stings, toot aches, gum infections and various other unpleasant occurrences.

Without cleansing and scrubs, skin would take twenty five days to wear off, not to mention the daily doses of makeup, pollution, smoke, mixture of sebum and dead skin, dust, dirt that collect on top, they trap the healthy layers and promote patches of redness and irritation, not to mention breakouts and an unhealthy environment for one part of our bodies that represents us so well is definitely a bad idea. Scrubs such as the tea tree oil one are not only natural but also gentle enough not to harm and over strip the skin when used accordingly to the skin type of the user. To get the most of the scrub, a quick steam bath is also very nice; I cover my head with a clean towel and lean over a bowl of hot water with some chamomile tea in it for five minutes. I don't put my face too close to avoid getting my skin burned but it's very relaxing and a great pore opener before the scrub and a mask.

This is the first foundation I have ever bought that actually matched my skin color EXACTLY.  I seriously can't see it at all on my skin!  It goes on velvety smooth and isn't greasy at all, and after a minute or two, it feels totally natural, with a soft matte finish.  I don't even have to use powder on it to set it.  My only complaint is that is very light and sheer, so it doesn't really cover up a lot of flaws (I have freckles around my mouth that it doesn't cover), but it works fine with a little concealer.  I haven't noticed much in the way of line reduction at all,either, I'm sorry to say.  But still a good foundation in itself

I will start with my age, I am 56 years old and this product is the best I found for covering the problem spots as well as the non-problem spots. 
This Line softening mousse is perfect for our age group who has not only lines to cover, but brown spots and other imperfections that seem to develope. This cream is very soft and you don't even know you have it on. I
I highly reconmend this product

I'll admit after reading reviews on how "small" the soaps where i was bit hesitant but i did it AND I'M SO HAPPY THAT I DID!  I got the rock chick set and fell in love before i even opened it!  The smell is to die for!  I can not explain it except YUMMMM and girls it's monday my bathroom still smells like it from a bath on friday evening!
There was no need for lotion after this bath either!  My skin was so smooth!  The bubbles never stopped!  And the shipping while a bit higher than norm well all i can say is you get what you pay for!  Well worthe it!  I think from now on i'll do a BIG order to save on shipping or what not but after one bubble bath and used the soap once i'm in love love love!  I haven't stopped telling people about this since i got it!
Definitely recommend to ANYONE!
No rings in my tub from the creamy bath or the soap!  And they gave me freebies in w/ my order!  This seems like a company that really cares and knows that word of mouth is what it's all about

People keep saying that you can cut a bubble bar in half and get plenty of bubbles, but I felt indulgent and I used the entire thing. I don't think I've ever seen so many bubbles in one bath! They stayed until the end. The smell was deliciously sweet, and the water was so soft and silky that afterwards I shaved with no shaving cream or anything. 

This may sound silly, but if someone ever made a bed as soft as those bubbles, I'd want one. I was playing with them, kind of patting them between my hands (which didn't pop them), and I just could not get over how soft they were.

When the water got cold, I just turned the faucet back on and added more hot water. Three times. I had so much trouble dragging myself out of that tub that I thought someone was going to have to come in after me!

I still smell like candy several hours later. I even conditioned my hair with a totally different scent, and my hair definitely smells like the bubble bath.

I'm addicted to Lush now! This month has been really stressful, and I'm getting through it by taking a bath every evening with something Lush. The massage bars are also wonderful

I love Lush - have always ordered it from Amazon as we have no local store.  This means that it is hit and miss for me as I cannot preview scents.  This one was a hit!!  This is one of their smaller bubble bars, but still plenty for two baths in a jacuzzi tub.  The smell is yummy and hollywood style bubbles - you know the kind in Pretty Woman!!  Lush is pricey, but I have never bought any other product that makes me feel like I didn't have to fight to get bubbles - like pouring in half the bottle.  If you haven't tried Lush before, this one is a great starter!

This smells of bubble gum or cotton candy and makes lots of bubbles. It is especially nice MIXED with the Butterball bath bomb, which has a vanilla-chocolate scent and the two make a very decadent mix in your bath. If you love sweets, this is a calorie-free way to indulge your senses

I usually add salts and bath oil to my baths as well as bubbles to add skin softening properties....but with this bubble bar, I don't have to!!  It's pink, it smells SO good, and the water and bubbles feel so soft against my skin!!  I absolutely LOVE this one~and I have tried many, LUSH brand and others~so much that I got the rock star soap in the matching scent.  I will say, however, that I have found it necessary to keep it in the fridge during the summer months although it arrives solid-I live in Florida so the humidity makes it soften a bit more than I'd like in the cabinet.  Overall?  20 stars!

I hated to use this bubble bar because it smelled so incredibly delicious!  It is easily divided into two or three chunks for two or three baths.  It does bubble a lot, leaves the bathroom smelling yummy, and leaves my skin very soft and moisturized.  I ended up ordering two more as replacements, I liked it that much.  A worthwhile indulgence to soothe the stress of life away in a tub of candy bubbles

I just started using Pur Minerals' 4-in-1 Pressed Mineral Makeup, and it is a wonderful product. It provides great coverage - even under my eyes, where I have terrible dark circles - and is not as messy as other mineral makeup cosmetics like Bare Essentials. When I used Bare, I used to have to use an additional concealer, too, but not with the Pur Minerals foundation. It was also really easy to find a good color to match my skin tone - and I am Italian, so I have yellow undertones, and it has always been hard for me to find good matching foundations in the past. Best of all, the makeup does not seem to clog my pores. I am not getting as many breakouts as I did in the past, and all I did was switch to Pur Minerals. I highly recommend you try it

I just had my toes done today and picked the color off the wall without giving it a second thought. After I got it on my toes though I just went crazy for it. I had to find the bottle so I could figure out what it was it. It ended up being China Glaze number 71, Sangria. Then my hunt began I went to all the beauty supply shops in my town and no one carried China Glaze. Thank god for Amazon and its vast and every expanding line of products... I can now have a bottle of my own!!! I LOVE THIS STUFF!!

The person from whom I purchased China Glaze Nail Lacquer in Shocking Pink Neon packaged my product safely and beautifully.  She even gave me a free, sample sized lotion.  My purchasing experience was very pleasurable, and I would gladly do business with this person again.  The polish application is a bit streaky, but this probably has to do with the manufacturer and not the seller

I am a fair skinned strawberry blond and was worried about the smokey eye look being too dark on me.  But this kit is great!  You can apply it with a heavy hand or lighter hand and get different effects.  The colors are great and would be great on any skin tone.  BE really did a nice job putting this together

If at first you don't succeed...play around until you get a better result- different approaches seem to work for individual Lush users.  Like most Lush products, Ocean Salt Scrub may take a little getting used to (and may behave differently depending on what type of water you have) but it is lots of fun to play with and delivers a good result.  Probably not for people who want a streamlined beauty routine that can be accomplished fast, but if you like to play... The scrub smells and looks amazing and the vodka/citrus combination definitely helps dry up blemishes.  I have sensitive skin and this has been helpful with once a week usage- any more than that and my skin gets tight and irritated and begins to flake.

One final note of caution: this scrub is serious when it says 'salt', so don't use it on or near broken skin.  Bath &amp; Body Works started using sugar in their scrubs for this reason, but salt has a great effect on clearing up problem skin and tends to help where things aren't seriously broken

This has to be the most invigorating facial/skin product I have ever purchased.  It's gentle enough to use on your face and will leave it polished and smooth (note: use only once a week if you have dry skin!).  If you've had a long day at work, or have been at the mall X-mas shopping all day, grab the ocean salt scrub.  Rub it all over your feet for an instant foot massage and don't forget to rub your hands, as well!  You will soon decide this is another Lush product you cannot live without..

Love, love, love the Ocean Salt. I have very, very dry skin, actually I have psoriasis. I use this to exfoliate my rough patches on my knees and elbows (haven't tried on my face as a cleanser), and it works great at removing all my dead skin. I then moisturize with Dream Cream (another wonderful Lush product) and these 2 products alone help keep my psoriasis under control without using my prescribed lotions.

If you are contemplating purchasing any Lush product, I say go for it. I have been a Lushie for about 3-4 years now (since my trip to the UK), and I have very rarely been disappointed in their products. Be aware that all internet purchases for Lush are shipped from their manufacturing facility in Vancouver, so unless you are willing to pay a bit for expedited shipping, expect a long wait time for delivery.

PS: And, no, I do not work for Lush, I just love their products and their business ethics

I tried this mascara a loonngg time ago at Macy*s and remembered it making my eyes really pop.  So after seeing it at Sephora I just had to buy it and test out my memory.  OMG it's just like how I remember it! With just a couple strokes of the wand my lashes are *instantly* lengthened and curled -- it's wonderful! Especially since I have STICK-STRAIGHT lashes that you can't even see unless I have mascara on (it's so irritating -_-;;).  

I think my favorite part about this mascara is that not only do you see my lashes but you see my whole eyes! They really pop with this mascara on, which is quite relieving considering I was told that it wouldn't help me unless I curled my lashes beforehand with an eyelash curler.  I'm sure pre-curling would instensify my look, but I honestly don't think it's necessary.  Besides, I like how natural my lashes look with this mascara on -- it really tricks you into believing that you were born with naturally beautiful lashes... it's so subtle yet defined!

I would HIGHLY recommend this mascara to any girl who needs an "uplift" with their lashes

Most masks made with clay seem to dry out so fast you hardly have time to put them on your face before you need to wash them off. They also only seem to serve one purpose, drying out your skin or removing oil. There are some that leave your face feeling nourished and this is one of the healing clay masks. I have sensitive skin with a tendancy towards being either dry or oily - guess it is that lovely combination skin problem. So, this mask seems to deal with both issues at once - removing dry skin and deeply cleansing the pores. 

Mask of Magnaminty is made with Bentonite, water, kaolin, honey, Phaseolus Angularis Seed powder, Evening Primrose seeds, peppermint oil, flower extracts, vanilla fruit extract and a chlorphyllin-Copper complex. 

This is fun to use in the bath or in the shower while you are shaving. Put it on for a few minutes, let it dry slightly and then rub off dead skin cells. The seeds provide the exfoliating power. 

Almost immediately upon looking in the mirror after leaving the tub, I could tell this mask had healing powers. Along with Dreamwash, my skin looked especially cleansed and calmed. I can recommend both to you if you have a need for skin brightening and calming. These two products seemed to work well together to create a radiant complexion. You may also want to try Prince Shaving Cream and the Dream On bath bomb. The Figs and Leaves soap is also very moisturizing. 

~The Rebecca Review 

P.S. If you can find someone to rub this all over your back, 
it feels so good and is easy to wash off by yourself later (unlike some clay masks I've tried).

I got this for Christmas and waited a whole 20 minutes before I indulged!  Split seconds after I began the application, my skin felt energized, my pores were singing Magnaminty praises.  Aside from the incredible feel of having this mask on, what I loved the most was it's dual personality - its an exfoliating scrub as you wash it off.  I use a variety of masks on a weekly basis and sometimes they are too strong on my skin.  Some feel like they are sucking the life out of my pores, others are very irritating, I can hardly wait for them to dry before washing off.  This mask is an all around great rejuvenator!  I would definetly buy again

HI

<review_text>
I bought this Lush product due to the high reviews by other Lushies and couldn't wait to get home to try it.  

When I opened the pot, the first thing I noticed was the color - it is a little turn-offish, but don't let that stop you from slathering your entire face with it.  The smell is amazing and not too minty or strong.  Like the previous review said below, it smells like mint chocolate chip ice cream.  I put the mask all over my face (you can put it on your neck and back as well), lie down for 15 minutes to get the full spa feel, then wash it off in the shower with warm water.  I find it is much easier in the shower because when the mask dries, it takes some rubbing to get it off.

When the mask is on, your face tingles from the mint and feels so refreshing!  When the mask is rinsed off, your skin feels even better.  Great cleanser and exfoliator in one!

Be sure to keep an eye out on the 'Best by' date because this only has a shelf life of 4 months

I loved this stuff- it was nice and cool and minty.  My face felt tingly and clean afterwards and the stuff smelled great.  It didn't seem to overly dry my skin.  I loved it and I would buy this again.  It really wasn't around long enough to worry about it's 4 month shelf life.

Its refreshing , and its not over powering. I love it.. I bought it for my friend for her birthday and we both usually wear gucci rush... but I wanted something different and this is perfect. Its light and it stays with you all day with just a spray or two.. and its enjoyable for those around you too.. After buying my friend a bottle I went and got myself one and have gotten nothing but compliments... This is a must have !

"Lovely" by Sarah Jessica Parker is hot right now and comes in a beautiful pastel pink bottle.  The scent is flowery, fruity, light and delicious.  The only downside is that the scent doesn't last!  It smells great when you apply it, but is almost completely gone after a few hours.  A great buy for young and old who don't mind reapplying every few hours:-

I love this shower gel, and coming from me, that is high praise, since I do not LOVE to shower, and am especially crabby when this activity must be done in the morning.  You see, I much prefer to languish in a warm bath, letting the bubbles do the work of getting clean for me, and instead devoting my energy to a good book.  Yet when I'm standing in the shower, enveloped in clouds of delicious blackberry steam, I am miraculously transformed from a crabby morning shower girl into a very happy girl who then goes about her merry way and walks up to friends at work offering an arm and encouraging them to "smell me". Lovely!!

I was expecting it to smell like blackberry jam but it smells like ripe, fresh crushed blackberries! I love it, it's sweet, juicy, just very mouth watering. Of course it's a great shampoo, I have fine hair and I don't have to use conditioner everyday. It doesn't weigh my hair down or make it frizzy. Great stuff!

Southwest sun can take its baking toll on hair unless you're wise and usually wear a hat. (I'm not wise and I don't really care for hats. Every once in a while there's an errant breeze during the summer months, and it feels good touching and lifting your hair) Now, I've accepted the blame for often dry lackadaisical locks, what's the solution? 

For me, Fekkai's Glossing Cream with its addition of pure olive oil delivers shine, hydration and manageability. It comes in the trademark Fekkai tube (easy to squeeze with wet hands). 

Since my hair is fine and fly-away it works best for me if I rub a small amount between my palms on towel dried hair and stroke through. Then I repeat the process after blow drying and before styling. 

It's incredibly light yet effective. Fekkai is simply the finest

I use this cleanser in the morning as a primer for other cosmetics.  At night I use the rinse off foaming cleanser, followed by the liquid mild facial soap, clarifying lotion 2, and Dramatically different lotion.  This soap works very well, delivering a very clean, open pore feeling.  It doesn't take mascara off that well, but that's why I use the rinse off foaming cleaser at night first!  Very good all purpose cleanser

You use it by putting the little metal loop around the blemish, then sort of gently pushing and raking it in one direction. Good for extracting white-heads or soon-to-be white heads. If I were to buy it all over again, I'd probably go for the one with the "lance" or little pin at one end instead of the blackhead extractor, sine that side is fairly useless

The first time I put this on, I noticed that the texture was a little thinner than regular Lip Venom.  The flavor is more... I don't know... medicinal I guess. The tingle of the "Maxi-lip" is nice, and it lasts quite awhile.  I put it on a few times the day I got it and was slightly disappointed that I didn't see or feel a difference -- until I woke up the next morning.  There was a noticeable difference in my upper lip and cupid's bow.  I still prefer Lip Venom over 2nd Sin as far as flavor and texture, but this works

"Cleopatra, renowned for her beauty, bathed in milk and almonds to keep her skin silky smooth and well nourished. Modern day goddesses can also enjoy the relaxing and cosmetic benefits of herbal bathing, a simple ritual almost forgotten in these tense and hurried times." ~Burt's Bees Herbal Milk Bath

The hand woven Abaca bag creates a little mystery because you can't quite see all the treats in the bag. What you will find when you open this luxurious Burt's Bees sampler bag is the following surprises: 

A Lavender Mask - Blocks out all the light so you can relax. A delicate and very natural lavender fragrance is subtly relaxing and not overpowering. The silk is quite luxurious and this is a comforting item that will last for years. 

Burt's Bees Pore Refining Mask - Ingredients (they have changed the ingredients to make it work even better than before): French green clay, bentonite, fragrance, peppermint leaf, shavegrass herb, calendula, rosemary leaf and sage. This mask is a lovely avocado green and will make you feel more calm. I loved how the powder can also be mixed with my favorite moisture mask or with natural ingredients for variety. 
I've rarely seen a product clean pores this well. You can simply pour some of the green powder into your hand and mix in a little water. After applying, let dry and then rinse. 

Burt's Bees Royal Jelly Eye CrÃ¨me - A rich eye crÃ¨me that is more like the consistency of a salve. You may be tempted to use this on hands and feet for a little healing luxury. The ingredients are delicious and include apricot kernel oil, aloe, grapefruit extract, royal jelly and vitamin E. Tempting to use as a lip gloss. 

Burt's Bees Moisturizing Herbal Milk Bath - If you were addicted to the Burt's Bees Baby Buttermilk bath, this is a nice grownup alternative. It contains milk powder, buttermilk powder, lavender oil, eucalyptus oil, rosemary oil and peppermint oil. Very relaxing and you may find yourself reading a little longer as you soak away your cares. You may notice your skin being especially healed and moisturized. 

Burt's Bees Calm Balm - A yummy lemon balm made from sweet almond oil, olive oil, beeswax, lemon oil, vitamin E, comfrey root extract, rosemary leaf, lavender, lemongrass oil and lemon verbena. You may start to imagine you are very close to a lemon meringue pie and wonder if you should probably make one. A delicious relaxing scent of lemony bliss. 

Burt's Bees Calming Candle - The tiny candle in this kit is super relaxing and can take you from stressed out to especially calm in a matter of minutes. I tried this candle when I was stressed and it definitely works. Would be a wonderful item to take with you when traveling as it has a lid. 

Burt's Bees Repair Serum - This product supports skin repair and renewal and works to reduce fine lines and wrinkles. Borage and Evening Primrose oils help to promote healthy skin. The oils absorb quickly and soothe and heal the skin. Ingredients: Rosehip seed oil, jojoba oil, lavender oil, vitamin E, evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, wheat germ oil, hazelnut oil, neroli oil, rose oil, calendula extract, green tea extract, beta carotene, tocopherol, vitamin C, vitamin A.

Burt's Bees Shea Butter Hand Repair CrÃ¨me - A luxurious blend of shea butter and cocoa butter, not to mention lavender, calendula, rose oil and rosemary. Not only will this heal and soothe your skin, it is emotionally calming and beautifully scented. 

As a gift, this is filled with healing ingredients that will create a very memorable experience. If you want to sample some of the best of Burt's Bees, it is also an ideal introduction to the world of natural skincare.

I have used this product daily since 1984 and it is worth every cent.  Do not, however, mistake this for a moisturizer.  That it is not.  But it seems to seal in the moisture on your face, and creates a smooth surface for the moisturizer to stay on.

I was told it was not recommended for the eye region, however that's where I use it regularly, and I have a minimum of fine lines &amp; crows feet for my age.

Use it drop by drop.  A little goes a long way!  Follow with a good moisturizer

This is a great sexy, intoxicating blend of gardenia mingled with white exotics.  It's lush and heady.  Whenever I wear this people always ask what I'm wearing.  The only downside is it's expensive for such a tiny bottle, 1/8oz (way small), but a little goes a long way. I've tried a few dupes for much less.  Haute Tub makes one that's almost spot on for about half the price

Does that sum it up for you?

How about the fact that it's small enough to tote anywhere.  Or the fact that EVERYONE asks what that beautiful smell is.

It's soft and delicious and lasts all day

Hello! I am an African American female,in my mid 30"s and I have never experence anything like this product before. About 3 months ago my stylist talked me into bleaching my whole head instead of just the striks that I usually get. What a terrible experence!!!!!!!!!! My hair started to fall out on top ( from the end of the crown to the very front of my head) and on one side towards the front. Mind you I had very long shoulder length black hair that was very much health. If I have learned anything as a women is that your hair is your beautie. Since then I was looking throuth the Essence Mag. and notice this product at the time. I order me a bottle and have been taking this product for about a month now. I have notice much change in my hair the growth, the breakage and shedding of my hair is gone. I love this product and would recommended to anyone one who ask

I am a white female in early 30s with long straight hair. I had a lot of stress over the last year and my hair was shedding like crazy, reducing in volume by half and thinning especially on the top of the head. I have been using this product for about one month now and the hair loss almost stopped! Nothing else helped before. I will definitely keep taking the product. I am using it together with the Phyto lotion on the top of my head. The overall result is very promising

These vitamins are great for healthy hair. I've been taking them for nearly a year and have experienced tremendous results. My hair is shiny and grows pretty quickly. After growing out my relaxer over three years ago, I resorted to a press and haven't regretted it. With my bi-weekly maintenance and phyto vitamins, my hair is more beautiful than ever

I am a black female mid 30's and noticed that my hair was thinning in the top. I ordered these and after the 1st month I was amazed at the growth. Even friends noticed the length and smooth texture after 1 month. I will be getting a second bottle soon. I hope the growth will continue as it did during the 1st few months

I had only smelled this perfume in magazine samples, but loved it then.  So I decided to order it.  It was so worth it.  It is one of the best perfumes I have ever smelled.  Very fruity and everyone compliments me on how I smell.  If you like fruity/floral, this is perfect for you

I have moderate acne (sometimes severe, depending on the day!), and this stuff is great.  After I wash my face and put on my lotion, I put this all over my face (all you need is a little more than a pea, maybe about the amt of toothpaste you'd use).  The key is to WAIT 2 MINUTES!  The first time I used it, I didn't wait, plus I think I used too much, and my makeup went on cakey and wouldn't spread.  So now, after I put it on, I put on my eye makeup while I'm waiting.  Also, I used to use Neutrogena liquid foundation (as I need GOOD coverage), but I didn't have much luck with liquid foundation over The Present, even after waiting 2 minutes.  I bought Philosophy's The Supernatural powder foundation, and it goes over The Present soooo well.  I didn't think a powder foundation would cover my acne well enough, but it does!  Both products together are a little pricey for me, but since I use them EVERY day, it's worth it.
Oh and I have very sensitive skin, hence all the breakouts, but The Present doesn't affect me.
The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I never tried another primer, and there may be something better out there, but I'm in no rush to search.  The Present works well for me

The Present is in a class by itself!  I have never seen a facial product do more!  After applying sunscreen and/or moisturizer, apply The Present.  This product will make your foundation (preferably philosophy airbrush canvas) go on smoothly, and makes it adhere to your skin.  Your skin is smoothed out filling in lines and wrinkles, as well as large pores.  It is just the greatest product ever. Sharon Perkins, Cordele, G

I've used this product for about a year and couldn't be happier.  I am not a 'makeup person' and this product is just what I need to smooth out my complexion AND moisturize my oily skin.  Fine lines and large pores appear less noticable, skin remains shine-free, skin tone appears more even and skin feels softer.

One recommendation.....the directions tell you to wait 2 minutes to allow the product to 'set'.  To get the best finish, especially if applying powder (like I do) or foundation over the primer, you need to wait the full 2 minutes.  This can't be stressed enough.

I've been using this product for a couple of years, and I can't imagine ever being without it.  The first time I put it on, however, I used too much and my Chanel foundation refused to spread - it just sat as a blotch on my face.  I took "the present" back to the makeup counter where they told me to use an amount equal to the size of half of a pea - for my ENTIRE face!  I was doubtful, but spreading it super-thin worked, plus each bottle lasts a long, long time.

Here are my favorite things about this product:
-Foundation glides on supersmooth
-Fine wrinkles are less visible
-Makeup stays put all day long
-Keeps oily skin shine-free
-Works great as an eyeshadow base to keep it from creasing
-Makes skin feel soft

The one downside is if I don't wash my face at night, I break out, probably because it really is like a "sealant" for your face.  Other than that, I love it, and will probably never switch to another base.

This product is amazing.  I use it under my eyes and on my cheeks where I have enlarged pores then wait 2 minutes and apply makeup and lines and pores are gone.  It makes makeup last longer too.  My daughter breaks out every once in a while and if she has something important then we put this stuff on over the pimple then apply makeup.  It makes a huge difference and again, it helps the coverage to last longer.

Well as you can tell from previous reviews, not every scent is for everyone, but philosophy Grace is definitely for me!!  I love this scent.  I got the Grace trio as a gift last Christmas and I'm hooked.  Amazing grace is my personal favorite, I like baby grace but it does smell babyish, and pure grace is too 'soap and water' for me to wear by itself.  But I like to layer it with the other graces and mix it up a bit.  After I'd been wearing this scent for a few months I tried to wear another one of my perfumes, and I as soon as I put it on I felt like I needed to take a shower. I realized how overpowering other perfumes can be, and now I'm spoiled, I'm definitely a philosophy girl!  I also highly recommend the shower gel and lotion, helps the scent stay a little bit longer

I recieved this as a christmas gift from my mother. I don't generally like to try or experiment with new chocolates as I am very picky about taste and texture. But as my mom gave this to me and raved about its taste so I thought I'd give it a try. I am so glad that I did!! 
At first I had an issue with the texture but I discovered that if you melt it in a couple of tablespoons of very hot water, then add the rest of the rest of the boiling water (or heated milk if you prefer)it makes the texture smooth and delicious!! I have even made the pudding and it came out fabulous! 
This hot chocolate is definately worth a try!

If you like dark chocolate you will love this cocoa.  It is rich and smooth and a real treat.  The pudding receipe is also yummy!  
The dark is not tart like some dark chocolates.  I have to say I now prefer this over the Marie Belle Regular Hot Chocolate and will continue to order it from Amazon b/c with shipping it is cheaper than direct from Marie Belle Site.

I bought this foundation in Light Beige.  After trying on every single foundatin in Sephora, I asked the sales assistant for something that would match my skin tone, look natural, and not be cakey.

She suggested this, and for forty-five dollars, I was leery.  It was a dewy finish, she said (dewy didn't interest me), and it didn't have a lot of pink in it.

I let her try it on me, but I have bought so many foundations over the years where I get home and it either doesn't look the same as it did in the store or I don't apply it the way they do in the store.

This makeup was different.  Very nice for my dry skin, the dewiness of which the sales assistant spoke actually doesn't leave a shiny, greasy finish.  The foundation goes on naturally, evening out my skintone and making my skin feel soft.  I love this makeup.  I'm just so glad I accidentally found it

Dear Gail (see frisky review): 

I have a secret to tell you. I tried the shampoo you recommended, but don't tell anyone else because if the word gets out on this one, there won't be any shampoo left for the two of us. The lemon oil really did make my hair feel frisky and with the papaya juice, not a single strand felt the weight of hairspray buildup. Thank you for showing the way to silky clean hair. I felt like a kid again who was running around in a lemon orchard, my hair loves this shampoo. As an added bonus, it also lightened my Lush henna experience, just slightly, so now I have the perfect hair color. 

Smiles,
Rebecca 

~The Rebecca Review

P.S. 
Try the Veganese conditioner with this shampoo because it also has a lemony scent and seems to be a nice lightweight conditioner. 

P.S. II 
While you are doing the citrus thing in the shower, why not try the Happy Hippy body gel with grapefruit too. I think it really does balance your aura. I feel cleansed.

My favorite thing about I Love Juicy shampoo is how little is needed to do the job. A dime's worth fabulously lathers my long hair. This would be great to travel with. 

I also found it cleans my oily hair exceptionally well. It smells good to boot. The scent, to me, is like grapefruit candy -- almost, but not quite, too fruity for my liking. 

I'm ordering more

The thing I like the best is the awesome fresh fruit smell. Not overpowering at all and not tacky like department-store brands. Actually smells like yummy fruits blended together. Not to mention that my hair looks amazing after.

The only thing I don't like: I Love Juicy smells so great, I never want to use any conditioner in my hair after because I want the smell of the shampoo, however I NEED to use conditioner on my hair. I found that using American Cream conditioner makes you smell like a delicous fruit smoothie! YUMMY

I got this product today and I put it on right away. I have had it on for a little over 5 hours and it stills smells after my workout. It is very subtle but it made my skin feel silky with a touch of shimmer. I do know that your body chemistry has a lot to do with how long it will last so it's not the same for everyone. It's just a nice product to carry in your purse for a little shimmer and glow oh and a wonderful smell of chocolate. It made me hungry though

I was very excited when this product arrived. I immediately opened it and put it on. It smells really nice and it has a very cute shimmer. I will definetly put this on while I am wearing a skirt or a low cut shirt. And the size of this is not bad either. Should last me a while. The only this that I did not like was the amount of shipping I had to pay ($5.95) but it's definetly worth it.

this is hands down my new favorite body indulgence product. smells delightful, just like yummy chocolate, has vitamins to condition your skin, in a convenient roll-on form, easy to travel with, &amp; leaves your skin with just the right amount of golden glow to it. not tacky or over the top, but not noticeable either, just perfect, also arrived on time &amp; the very best, it doesn't leave skin sticky at all!!!!!!!!

The Chocolate Body Glosser goes on smooth and is long lasting.  The chocolate fragrance is something you can enjoy for the whole day.  It has a subtle shimmer that's great in the summer and gives a nice warm appeal to a cold winter's day

Product was in tip-top shape, and is itself a wonderful fragrance, but I ordered in hopes of getting it here by a certain date and it did not arrive by the time I had hoped.  The gift-wrap was very lackluster and could have been MUCH better.

Good product, bad delivery

I bought this after reading an interview with Ms. Brown where she said this one of the pieces of makeup she considered indispensable for herself. She uses it for a bit of coverage on her cheeks or where needed instead of full foundation. So, I got it in Sand and used it on my cheeks, nose and chin, feathering it out to blend with my skin. Sometimes I'm a bit ruddy in those areas and this provided a bit more coverage than my usual tinted moisturizer. I like it and will use it

I absolutely love this fragrance. It smells so light and clean! I'm not usually much for perfume but when I smelled this I loved it. It really does smell like the best soap and water combination. Its a light fragrance but you dont get the strong alcohol smell like you get with other light fragrances. A really great spring and summer perfum

I'm a little leary of buying a fragrance online, but after reading the many rave reviews of Pure Grace, I thought I'd try it. I was NOT disappointed! This fragrance truly does smell like soap &amp; water - you really do have a clean, fresh scent after putting it on. I layered it, so it would last longer, and that would be my one &amp; only complaint - the spray alone does not last very long. But, it's worth it, though. It's a wonderful fragrance

This is the best lotion ever.  It absorbs and moisturizes for a long time.  It contains plenty of cocoa butter.  It is made by the Body Shop so it is never tested on animals.  The fragrance is pretty neutral which is great if you don't want to smell like perfume-y lotion, or if you want to wear a different fragrance.  One of the best products on the market.  The Body Shop even included a free gift

I am COMPLETELY hooked on this face soap-as a matter of fact, I have another bar coming to me in another Lush shipment soon!  Before I had EXTREMELY oily skin-the kind of skin that needed washed multiple times a day in the summertime, but since I've started using this I can go all day and my skin still feels awesome and isn't the least bit grimy or shiny.  It works as an AWESOME exfoliator and, though previous review state that it's harsh, I haven't had any problems with it at all.  My biggest issue with this is that the smell reminds me of a "machine" shop...very "motor oil-ish" which made me VERY sceptical to use it at first but now I can't go with it.  Actually I forgot this item at a friend's house for one weekend and had to go back to using my store bought stuff and my skin was SOOOO oily-I got 8 breakouts in just that one weekend!  I will NEVER NEVER use anything else other than this on my skin again!  If the scent bothers you then I have found that some "Sexy Peel" soap will get rid of it if you use it right after you've scrubbed with Coal Face

My skin is quite oily especially the T-zone area and my face suffers from those pesky small whiteheads around my nose and mouth.  Previously, the only thing that worked for me were regular facials to slough them off.  Not anymore...Within two days of using it, my face is much cleaner and no more visible dirty pores.  I did have to be a bit careful with the drying factor and used it only once a day or every other day.  I don't think this is for everyone but great for those with oily skin.  Ask for a sample if you have a store near you

My husband has very oily skin and this soap is great for him.  It doesn't dry his skin out and leaves his face clean and mosturized.  He also says, "It doesn't smell girly."  It can be messy and leave black bits in the sink, so rinse well and don't use white towels with it.  It is a bit expensive but lasts a very long time.  My skin is combination, and I find the dry spots don't do well wtih this soap, but it really helps with the oily bits.  I use it when I run out of other products, but it isn't my favorite for me

I got a sample of Coalface with another Lush product that I ordered.  The smell kind of turned me off at first, but I figured I would give it a try.  This is the best facial cleanser that I have ever used!!!  Just five days of using it and my face is more clear than it's been for ages!  I'm also a lot less oily, so my makeup stays on longer.  I will be using this cleanser exclusively

I'm in love - Aquolina have done it again!!!

'Chocolovers' is the darker, sexier, naughty but nice sister of the sugary 'Pink Sugar'. Sort of like Dannii Minogue to Kylie.

Not as sweet as 'Pink Sugar', when first applied I got the rich aroma of the lemon and orange, combined with coriander, preventing it from being zesty. I could also smell roasted nuts.

After a few hours the vanilla base comes through and mingles with the hazelnut, with the result being a work colleague commenting on the smell of my hot chocolate (no, I didn't have any).

Enjoy!

Light and refreshing. Different from all other colognes I've used before. Discovered this cologne over Christmas and my wife bought it for me for Valentines Day!  Love it and have used it every day since. Although she bought the bigger bottle. I've been a fan of Calvin Klein fragrances but will have to look into more of Armani's now. This is a great change of pace

       There's something about Armani!  His fragrances are as stylish and classic as his designs.  Acqua Di Gio is a case in point with its virile, mysterious, intriguing scent.  It's fresh and at the same time sensual.

	Notes include Calabrian bergamot, neroli, and the zest of green tangerine, each warming and giving vitality to the fragrance.

	Mr. Armani has said that the inspiration for this scent came from the shoreline of Pantelleria island, a body of land which lies in the Mediterranean Sea between Sicily and Tunisia.   Pantelleria is one of a kind, a rarity as is Acqua Di Gio

okay first of all im not really a kid im 16 years old and while other people my age are trying to impress chicks with Axe and Tag, I am taking the smarter route and using some real stuff. I bought this cologne because everyone I heard about who has this cologne loves it. Yes it may be too popular now for optimal use but it is still one of the best colognes on the market today. When I was checking out Acqua di Gio I didn't think it smelled as good as some of the other colognes and I thought it was too expensive at over 50 dollars, but I bought it anyway. I have not been disappinted at all. Its fragrence is so casual but classy, its so subtle that people who are around go out of their way to smell you and be around you without even realising you're wearing a cologne. The bottle is very good too, its very simplistic and classy which describes the contents to a tee. The bottom line is this is an essential cologne

The concentrated version (Prada Intense Deluxe Eau de Parfum)of this perfume is by far the best version as the 2.7 oz refillable version can smell a bit cheap at first and wears off after about 6 hours.  This one smells strong first thing out of the bottle but never cheap, and certainly not overpowering.  This the best option for the money.  Don't be fooled by the picture used by the retailers to differentiate the Intense Delux from the 2.7 oz refillable; the bottle is not actually purple, that's simply the cardborad cover.  The actual bottle is simply a smaller version of the 2.7 oz refillable

I absolutely love this scent. I originally got the perfume and the 3 in 1 as a gift set and loved it so much I bought the lotion. The scent is a very light sort of cotton candy smell. I have a huge sweet tooth and just love the sweet smells. If you like cotton candy or a sugary smell then you'll love this

First off, I'm a lavender snob.  I like it fresh and grow several types in my garden and so friends/family often gift me with lavender products...but it's rare to come across something with a true, full lavender scent like this product.  It's a great bath product and a little goes a long way.  Just love it! It's so sweet to take a big bubble bath and then go to bed in a cloud of lavender...ahh

This is the ultimate touch when hosting guests at your home. A fresh white hand towel and a new Roger &amp; Gallet soap makes your guest feel so welcome. 

The soaps are French-milled, meaning they are aged and milled under some pressure to make the soap long-lasting. The fragrances are elegant:

Bouquet ImpÃ©rial  
Extra-Vieille  lemon with orange blossom 
Carnation 
Green Tea 
Lavande Royale  
Ginger  
tea Rose
Fern  
Lily of the Valley 
Magnolia  
Gardenia  

All the fragrances are complex mixes with blends of woods, spices and florals. Keep a dozen on hand for your guest bath (and some brand new white towels; these can be bleached and kept fresh and pretty--colored towels tend to fade, so I use white for my guest towels.

I've had the Clarisonic brush for one year now and I love it.  My skin feels really clean and looks very smooth.  Because of the price tag I haven't given any as gifts, but I recommend it to everyone.  Customer service has been great the two times I contacted them.  First because my skin broke out the first week I used it.  They offered to take it back, but I persevered and have not had a break out since.  I also thought the brush had stopped holding a charge, and customer service gave me a number to call, but I was mistaken so I never did make the call. I highly recommend this brush

This is the first bronzer I actually finished. This gives the most natural finish and blends really well. I like that it's matte because I'm not a fan of sparkly bronzer. Ever since I started using this, I'm just addicted and can't live without it. It gives the skin a really natural, healthy-looking flush.

I've got medium/olive skin and I use "Light". My skin doesn't look orangey or dirty. Try it and I'm sure you'll like it. Make sure you use a really good brush.

"Through the ancient process of steam distillation, the fresh petals of a million roses yield just sixteen ounces of the precious essential oil known as attar of rose." 

Attar of Rose is featured in the Burt's Bees Repair Serum. A tiny trial size bottle (5 ml) can now be found in the Healthy Treatment Facial Care Kit, but after you try this product you might want a larger size for daily use. 

This product supports skin repair and renewal and works to reduce fine lines and wrinkles. Borage and Evening Primrose oils help to promote healthy skin. The oils absorb quickly and soothe and heal the skin. 

Ingredients: Rosehip seed oil, jojoba oil, lavender oil, vitamin E, evening primrose oil, borages seed oil, wheat germ oil, hazelnut oil, neroli oil, rose oil, calendula extract, green tea extract, beta carotene, tocopherol, vitamin C, vitamin A. 

Recently I tried this in the bath in addition to 
a bath oil and it seemed to enhance skin softness.

*****
This is a natural facial repair serum from Burt's Bees, and it is excellent for this use.  However, I rarely use it on my face, except at night sometimes, because it is so intense and heavy.  The rest of the time I use it EVERYWHERE else!  I mix it with my overall body moisturizer (which is pure sesame oil) and rub it all over my body.  I use it full strength on my hands.  I use it anywhere on my body that needs attention, healing, moisture.  For special occasions, I use it as an all-over body moisturizer full strength.

I go through probably a bottle a month, so it is "expensive", but I enjoy it so much I don't care.  A little goes a long way, but I am using it for so many things. 

The smell is probably my favorite small of any "beauty" product.  It is an aromatherapy-type smell, earthy, not perfume-y at all. All of the oils are natural, and blend together to create a perfect lovely fragrance.  It is subtle, but unlike anything else I've tried.

The ingredients are: Rosehip seed oil, jojoba oil, lavender oil, tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E), evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, wheat germ oil, hazelnut oil, neroli oil, rose oil, calendula extract, green tea extract, beta carotene, tocopherol, ascorbyl palmitate (vitamin C), retinyl palmitate (vitamin A).  They are all natural and wonderful!

I like the bottle size too, as it is easy to travel with. At the price, I consider Burt's Bees Repair Serum an affordable luxury that I can't do without!

My skin gets really aggravated by almost every product I try. This moisturizer is an exception! I use Aveeno's ultra calming cleanser, and follow up with Murad's skin perfecting lotion when my skin feels dry. I am 39 with sensitive/combination skin and occasional blemishes. This lightweight moisturizer does not cause my sensitive skin to break out -- hallelujah! Thanks, Dr. Murad, for a great product

Saw this product recommended in a couple of magazines as good, and it lives up to its name.  It's somewhat costly, but will last for a while.  Consistency is that of rubber cement which might not sound appealing, but it goes on easy with your finger and after 15-20 minutes peels off easily

I've been exclusively wet shaving for several months, using a Merkur Trac II style razor.  Having decided to take the plunge to a DE safety razor, I ordered the Merkur Futur Adjustable.  For my initial shave I set it on "1" (least aggressive), and got an absolutely wonderful shave, with no nicks, razor burn, or any discomfort at all.  Even around my jaw line and the point of my chin (notoriously touchy areas) there were no problems whatsoever.  At fifty cents a blade this is a wonderfully economical way to shave after the initial investment in the razor, which barring earthquake, fire, or apocalypse should last a lifetime

This is without a doubt the best razor I have ever owned. Combined with a badger hair brush and cream, it is perfect. In addition, this particular razor is constructed of solid stainless steel. So when it is run under hot water, it gets warm and the thermal mass keeps it warm, an extra nice touch. It is of excellent German craftsmanship and quality and worth the price.

The shave from this razor is so spectacular that I almost get carried away and shave my whole body.

Awesome Razor. I save a lot of money of razor blades now too! No more over priced packs of blades were I would spend $15 for 8 blades

This is an excellent razor.  You can get a very good shave without any nicks or cuts if you use proper technique.  Consult the "Art of Shaving" for how to prepare your face.  With this razor you should use short strokes and do not apply extra pressure.  Allow the weight of the razor to to do the work, a couple of light strokes is better than one heavy stroke and is much less likely to cut your face.  After shaving with the grain you can re-lather and shave against the grain if desired.  This razor allows you to have more control over your shave, but requires more effort from the user than cartridge razors.  For instance, a cartridge razor will pivot to adjust to your face to some extent.  A safety razor is fixed and therefore you have to change the angle of the blade (by raising or lowering the razor's handle in relation to your face) to accomodate the undulations of your face.  This is less of a pain than it may sound, after you use the razor for a week or two it will become second nature.  I have used it for about two week and have not cut my face since the second shave.  If you follow this technique and keep your face properly lathered you will enjoy a nick free and comfortable shave.

One more thing, you will need to experiment with the "closeness" setting of the razor to find what is best for you.  Start with the lowest setting and increase it if necessary.

I took the plunge and bought a Merkur Futur Razor, after years of shelling out for expensive Gillette Sensor blades. The problem with my old razor was that it ALWAYS gave me skin irritation and didn't allow me to shave often enough. With a Safety razor like Merkur's my face gets an easy shave that is smoother than any razor I've used before. My fiance agrees as well. The only problem is that I do take much longer to shave now than I did before. The reason is this: Since there is no lubricating strip on the razors, I have to constantly use more shaving cream to keep the face lubricated if I want to get that perfect shave. I also have a hard time defining my goatee since I go for very straight and clean lines

I bought the extra mild soap and the #1 toner, after breaking out with the mild soap and the #2 toner. the extra mild soap is much creamier and gentle. It gets rid of makeup and dirt and my face feels clean. Using it with the #1 toner and the lotion in the 3-step system, my skin is finally healing from my breakout with the mild soap and #2 toner.

this soap is great, and it lasts a long time. well worth the 11 bucks.

I had been looking for a good under eye cream and stopped at the Lancome counter one day and this is what the saleslady recommended. I really love this eye cream and swear it works in reducing fine lines and firming my undereye area.  Although it is a bit pricey, it is well worth it! It has a nice feel when I put it on and a nice smell. I love and highly recommend lancome products. I will purchase it again once I have used the last drop

I used it like the instructions said and the most visible results were that my eyes had a more "awake" appearance and a tightening of the under-eye area. I've had it for over a yr now and there's a tiny bit left so I need to restock. It's a dense cream and you only need a tiny bit.I have ultrasensitive eyes and it didn't irritate my eyes and it did not have a greasy feel at all. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is not usable on the lids. I tend to get dry eye-lids.

First of all, I do not work for Lancome.  
Among the name brand eye creams I have ever used, this is by far the best.  
Finelines are much less visible right after I tapped it around my eyes. 
I recommend this product to anyone looking for good eye cream.

This gel firms up the skin on your butt, thighs, and hips (and anywhere else you need firming) so you don't have as much of that orange peel/cottage cheese look.  It won't make you fit into smaller jeans, but gives you a more toned appearence

i thought this kit was a steal since it is a credible brand and it included all the basic needs that i use everyday for an extremely reasonable price. i don't use the lip gloss as much as the others because for me, the colors of the lip gloss don't match the natural look im going for. all the other products are out of this world though, they are very light and the liquid powder is like none ive seen before. you can put it on underneath or as a final layer and both work. i definitely recommend this kit because it works with EVERY skin tone.

I've tried Cargo's lipgloss in Soho before, and loved the nude shimmery color, but haven't tried its other products, so I loved that they put this collection together, and the price is right. For seperatly, just the Cream to Powder foundation, its $22 and Beachblush is $26, you're saving money right there...

Most pure badger hair brushes on the market sell for at least $50, so this is a bargain compared to most.  For the first week, my brush shed a little; however, this stopped after the first week.  I have been happy with the brush, especially considering the price.  I would recommend this brush for anyone who thinks they want to start using a shaving brush.  This is a good, inexpensive way to "test the waters".  Then, if you find that you will continue using a shaving brush, I would recommend buying a higher-end brush.

Moisturizing but not greasy. Absorbs well, but give it a little time before you put on mascara. The skin under my eyes is more supple, and crows-feet appear less noticeable, I think because of the moisturizing. Stings a little if you get it too close to your eyes.

I absolutely love this shampoo!  The small amount of product it takes to make a mass of lather is incredible.  Which is nice because you won't go through the bottle that quickly.  It did a great job of gently cleansing my hair without making it feel like straw afterwards.  Now the scent...  Utterly addictive!  Now I'm not a big fan of mint smells,  but the way this was blended with the other scents is amazing.  You can definitely smell the mint, but it's not by any means overpowering.  Mixed in with the mint is a wonderful fruit scent,  that literally smells "juicy".  In the background, very lightly is a touch of herbal.  I happen to HATE anything herbal,  so I was surprised that I even liked this.  The smell is very unique and delicious!

Ok,  all that being said though - it did just as good a job as most any other Lush shampoos (including some of the solids).  I also use their Trichomania and Big and they do the same kind of lovely job Rehab does.  The price just kills me.  I know that real oils, juices and herbs are used, but unfortunately I can't afford to make this item a staple.  Still,  if you don't have a problem with the price,  definitely pick up a bottle (start with the smallest size though!) and give it a try.

HI
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
Let me start by saying that, yes, I am a LUSH fan, and no, I am in no way affiliated with LUSH (wish I was... employee discount!).

LUSH has done it again.  Another great product that is safe (no chemicals, all natural prodcuts) and actually works better then name brand items.  Rehab Shampoo smells great, a really nice citrus smell, and is perfect for damaged (or not) hair.  My hair isn't damaged that much, but I found Rehab to be a great preventative shampoo also.  Washes out very clean and when followed with Retread or American Cream, my hair has never been better.

Like the other review said, LUSH products take some time getting used to because they don't use chemicalls to make your hair 'feel' soft.  They actually use ingredients that help the damage, rather than hide it.  Please keep that in mind when you try their products.  Give it some time before you make a final discision

I am a first time Lush customer, but this shampoo alone has me convinced to try more of their products. Recently, I have noticed that my "good old" Matrix shampoo has left my naturally wavy hair limp and dull. I read about Lush solid shampoo in Lucky magazine, and thought I'd give it a try. I ordered Seanick through their website.

The box arrived today, and I eagerly ripped it open. Seanick arrived wrapped in tissue paper and I could already smell it. It smelled great, not girly, but like the ocean. I was so taken by this that I hopped in the shower to try it out. The bar itself is just like the picture shows--bright blue and studded with seaweed. I could see how some people wouldn't like the "plants in my hair" aspect, but I like it. The bar lathered up quickly with lots of bubbles. I actually kind of had fun washing my hair for once. I put a little conditioner on as well, about half of what I normally use. As I towel-dried my hair, it actually squeaked. Pretty clean!

As my hair dried, it was nice and fluffy. Believe it or not, it was actually curlier and my sister said it was a little lighter. All good things. I use a lot of product in my hair, so maybe it cleaned all that off. Anyway, my hair feels silky, shiny, and soft. I even used it as a body soap! What a nerd... 

I love the whole idea behind a solid shampoo and think it would be great to travel with. I highly recommend this to anyone, especially if you have limp and boring hair. My only complaint is that the awesome smell doesn't last..

HI
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
I've noticed that products IN the LUSH stores almost always smell different when you get them out of the store.  In the store, I didn't like the smell of this shampoo bar at all, but I bought it because of the awesome softening benefits of the seaweed.  When I got home to try it out, the smell was much nicer and subtle.  I guess all the smells in the store take over and you can't smell the actual product that accurately.  

This shampoo was wonderful.  Only needed three strokes of the bar down my below-the-shoulder length hair and my hair lathered up really nicely.  Just be sure to keep this shampoo bar (as with all the shampoo bars) out of water when you aren't using it or it will turn into mush.

Took off a star because a traditional bottled shampoo is much easier and convinient to work with and store.  Really nice take with you on trips, though.  If you want a shampoo and conditioner bar, try Hybrid or Godiva

I bought this a while back and used it primarily as a shampoo/shower gel. I recently put my hair through a lot of processing and was worried about what this would do to my perm/color.

Well, one day I ran out of shampoo and used this.

Not only did it not ruin my hair, but it made it look and smell great. No more heinous perm smell. w00t

This is a good and effective cream for creating smoother and firmer skin.  It feels good going on and tightens your pores, creating a smooth feel and look.  Use it with a moisturizer on top.  Even though it is a little expensive, a little actually goes a long way.  I actually felt that my skin felt firmer after 10 days

This mascara is almost impossible to screw up putting on... it keeps my lashes separated and with a few coats really emphasizes my natural lash length.  It stays on all day without rubbing off under the eyes or causing black circles, even if you have to use eyedrops or if it's a super hot day -- AND -- it comes off with simple soap and water... no hard-core scrubbing until your lashes fall off, no need for expensive "eye makeup removers."  Overall awesome product.  Received a sample as a gift and now I'm hooked

This is a great mascara really. It does make you lashes lush and doesn't get really clumpy like some midrange mascaras. The one issue I have is that after a couple hours of wear I notice that black gunk begins to accumulate in the corners of my eyes...not so attractive. Maybe I'm a rare case. I do recommend trying it but just know you might end up with that

I do not have the most luxurious lashes so finding a mascara that will give me the thickness and length that I want is hard. This mascara however exceeds my expectations, the only thing is that I wish it came in waterproof. Other than that, fully satisfied.

Many years ago, I worked in sales management in the beauty industry, and at that time I saw that in some products there was a great difference in the quality of products.

My beautiful wife was a model at that time, but somehow she never learned that fact. For years one of my wife's rituals was to sit in the sink, put on cheap mascara, and spend an hour separating her lashes with an open safety pin. After waiting through this ritual for many, many years, I went and bought her a tube of LancÃ´me Waterproof. After refusing to try it until she ran out of her drug store brand, she finally broke down and tried it. She has refused to use anything else ever since. It makes her day easier, and I get more of her time...

Philosphy's On A Clear Day h2o2 may seem a bit overpriced at $20 for a 1 oz. jar, but it's worth the expense. This tiny jar has a tremendous amount of applications, since only the minimal amount needed to cover the skin is enough to see results. I've had problem skin for years now. For the most part my skin is clear, but I frequently get one or two large cysts that won't go away. This cream has resolved those problems and has smoothed out my skin more in general. It also acts as a gentle moisturizer, without adding extra oil to the skin. I apply a tiny amount to my face every evening before bed, all over--and in the morning I exfoliate with St. Ives Apricot Scrub in the shower. I cannot tell you how much of a difference it has made for me. My skin glows now and is more evenly toned; this was not the case when I was just using the apricot scrub. If you try it, I hope you have the same results as me

This is truly the best in highlighting products and I have tried many high end and cheaper products out there.  This is so light and just doesn't get all cakey and greasy.  I have tried so many brands that claim to look natural, but they just don't.  This really does and don't let the price fool you either.  It only takes alittle and lasts a long time, so well worth the price for the look it gives.  I love this!

I am 51 and recently visited an upscale retail store in Manhattan.  The Yves St Laurent gal behind the cosmetic counter noticed my complexion was a little sallow - put this product about an inch on each side of my nose and blended it in..what a difference it made...a worthwhile investment..I use it under my eyes and just about all over my face for a nice touch-up, concealer and brightener..covers freckles and sun spots, too

I love the taste of this, it's so yummy. Tastes like lemon cookies and cake. Looks good too. I would give it 5 stars except the only downer about Philosophy glosses are that they are pretty sticky, so if you have animals, you get fur stuck on your lips sometimes, or whatever. You know what I mean, sticky gloss attracts things. But it looks good and tastes very good

I saw them use an airspray type of foundation on America's Next Top Model (not sure which brand) But I was impressed with this technique and wanted to try it - the only one I found was Dior.

By far the best foundation i've tried! I like the other Dior tint foundation - but thought it was too heavy.
The mist feels light...maybe a little too light. Yet once you apply, it does the job perfectly - you really do get an even airbrushed look.

I won't give 5 stars simply for the price - sorry but $60 is too much for a 2.3oz can

Good news is if you apply it right it can last a while

The DiorSkin AirFlash is very easy to apply, and gives a light matte finish that wonderfully evens out skin tone.  Once applied, it's very lightweight- you can't feel it on your skin at all.  Not much is needed, HOWEVER, there's barely any product in the can.  I used it off and on for about a month, perhaps 15 applications in my estimation, and the can was bone dry after that.  For $60, this is unacceptable!  And I wasn't piling it on or anything, I would just do a light mist over my nose and cheek area.

If this was half the price, I would give it 5 stars, it's really a great product, but for a can mostly filled with compressed air, I have a hard time shelling out that kind of cash

It is non-irritating and works. Although not as effective as a tretinoin product in keeping hyperpigmentations at bay, I do notice it helps keep my skin plump. It is emollient without being overly so and is light enough to wear every day. The Cream is a little more emollient if your needs require it. I do use this every day after cleansing my face

This is a clean-smelling, refined fragrance that stays on all day long. 
I recommend it to everyone loving fragrances such as "Costume National" and the like. The package has reached Italy in a couple of weeks by standard shipping, suitably packed up, with free samples included. Besides, European shoppers may rely on a profitable exchange rate.
As far as I'm concerned, I advise everyone to trust Beautiful Perfumes and Amazon.com

This is a day-time fragrance that I can't live without. I'm the type of person who doesn't like things smelling too florally or girly-girl (e.g Paris Hilton or Maria Sharpova fragrances, which don't suit me at all). At the same time, I don't want something that's too " mature" and leaving me smelling like an old lady (too strong and musky). Eau Des Merveilles is somewhat of an in-between fragrance that's hard to describe and very unusual. It's woodsy but it has amber, pepper, and  citris notes. It's refreshing, modern, and chic. 
You don't need to overspay this stuff either. It's potent and you'll probably be mistaken for wearing cologne if you overkill it. 

People like how I smell with this fragrance, and some even say that I smell like "clean laundry," which is a good thing (for me atleast). You should try this stuff at sephora or at a fragrance dealer before buying it though. People's body chemistrys ( amount of perspiration, oil production, foods they eat, etc.) can make perfumes smell differently. Spray it on and seell it after a few hours.

I don't know who writes the descriptions, but this perfume is definitely not sweet. If you find yourself drawn to fragrance notes commonly found in men's cologne you will love this fragrance. It is unique in that it is feminine but with a strong woodsy (I think it is oak or cedar) tone to it. It isn't heavy though, in fact it is very light, very clean, subtly floral, subtly spicy and oaky. All in all, a modern and unique fragrance

This is by far my favorite lip gloss I've ever tried.  It's not gooey or gloppy, as one previous reviewer mentioned. Each color is unique, but blends well with most skin tones (I am a freelance makeup artist, so I have used these colors on varying people).  If you use just a dab, it can even last through my hours in the gym, and definitely adds just the right shine for a photo shoot. 

It may be a tad expensive but worth it.  My one gripe -- did they really discontinue my favorite flavor &amp; color, Sin?

I adore these cute little pots and as with all Urban Decay products, the colors! They're very smooth and creamy which I like,because if I wanted lipgloss to be opaque I'd get lipstick instead. I have no problem with it staying on. In fact I put some on before work today and seven hours later I could see in my car mirror that I still had it on my lips on my way home.My only complaint is price which is a thing with all UD products, but one gets the assurance that the product isn't tested on any woodland critters, and that the pigments are high quality

I agree with the previous commenter that the scent doesn't continue post-bath (which may be a good thing if you wanted to apply a different scent, or a bad thing if you were hoping to smell like vanilla afterwards) also, I wouldn't reccomend just shampooing with this to be the only step in your hair care regime (extremely convenient 3-in-1 is great for travel but not for everyday.) definitely use a conditioner!!!

But all in all it is a very lovely scent, makes a great bubble bath and leaves skin silky smooth &amp; clean

This stuff really works. This is the only product that I have ever used in my life that gives me this shine and soft texture. I always use salon brand products, hot oil treatment, treatment at salons and they were never this noticeable. 

I like the smell. It's nothing familiar or fruity. It's a natural scent. I like it. I would definitely buy this brought again. I wish the product was a little bigger though.

This is THE best conditioner you will ever try.  I have coarse, dry, very straight asian hair and this makes my hair unbelievably, ridiculously, shiny and soft.  I don't know about the smell though, . . my husband isn't to fond of it, but boy oh boy this stuff works.  I kid you not!!!  I have tried almost everything out there from the least expensive to the stuff that I have to ask "How much!?"  none of them come close to this.  The only down side is that LUSH takes FOREVER to ship.  I don't know if it would be faster to order direct.  I'm tell you girls, . . try it.

I have dry, fine, difficult hair and have tried (no kidding) just about every product claiming to add volume and body to hair like mine. From specialty stores to prescription items - I've found a few that do work somewhat.  I depend on conditioners to be the most important product in my hair regime because the conditioner you use has the greatest impact on how your hair turns out that day....trust me - I know.  I've got this hair product thing down to a science.  I used the two Lush products this morning: Big Shampoo and Retread.  Holy **** - what a difference.  I am so happy right now - you should see how good my hair looks today - I used this for the first time this morning and here are some of the key points:

1.  You only have to use a very little bit (I have hair past my shoulders and I only used about 2 teaspoons).

2.  The product smells like Heaven. It's got that affluent expensive natural smell - not that perfumey dimestore smell. 

3.  The frangrance lingers on and on - I've had GUYS tell me how good I smell.

4.  After using with the other product "Big Shampoo (or Hair)" - my hair was thick, soft, shiny, silky, with lots of movement - no static. 

5. This conditioner gives me the perfect moisture balance (for my hair anyway - I have very thin, fine, dry hair).

As far as lush overall:

Let me first state that I am in no way affiliated with Lush - I placed an order for over $100 worth of Lush products and this was one of the products in the order. The only negative thing was the shipping turnaround (little over 3 weeks) but when my Lush items came in - I didn't care. The scent of all the products is gorgeous!!! It's made with all natural products that actually smell awesome and last throughout the day. Not too perfumey at all but definitely recognizable to others. I had guys commenting all day on how good I smell!!!!! The packaging is delightful, the product presentation is adorable, and the quality is better than I've EVER experienced. Better than Benefit, better than Philosophy, etc. I buy and try just about every new product line that comes out - some I like some I don't. I can tell you that this line is my new favorite! I'm going to stock up on everything they have because not only do the products work, they are so pretty to look at that I will use them as decorations in my bathroom!!!

Customer service is extremely responsive and doesn't reply with form letters to your concerns and questions. They said they are working to improve their shipping times and were very accomodating. They also gave me some nice coupons with my order!

10 stars out of 5

Rosebud Salve--what a find!  I wanted it because it was something that I had heard about and knew had been around a long time.  It goes on my lips every night, and is something I will keep around the house and with me.  I've been a long-time user of Daily Conditioning Treatment from Blistex, going through many little pots of it, but Rosebud is replacing it.  I'm ordering extra tins of it today

I have recently bought this product to try and I'm already a little obsessed. I'm a lip product junkie, but nothing compares to this salve. It leaves my lips soft, supple, but not greasy or sticky. And unlike other lip balms (like softlips), it doesn't make my lips flake or peel. It may be a little expensive, but it is well worth the cost.I can see why this has been such a staple for so many people over the years. I'm already in love with it

I am pleased to recommend Rosebud Salve.  My children call it the "miracle salve".  My mother always had Rosebud in the 60's when I was young.  I purchased a jar in Gatlinburg Tennessee, but because I live in Ohio to replace the jar was difficult.  I was thrilled to find it online.  I bought 4 jars for my daughters who are now young ladies with homes of their own.

I recently started using this toner again; I used it for a while in college but my post-college budget didn't allow for non-drugstore facial products. Thank goodness I'm able to use it again! 

Tonique Clarte keeps my combination skin in control despite the North Carolina humidity, and feels good both right after application and several hours later. I've tried numerous toners and this is definitely the best

Yet my skin tone looks even and glowing. I love it and highly recommend it. I have gotten many friends hooked on it as well :) It is good for people with problem skin. Since I have been using it I RARELY break out. It is oil free and water based

I was given one of these great bath towels by a friend, and have been nothing but impressed. It is by far the best exfoliation product I have ever used. On my first use, I must say that the salux is a bit scratchy if you are not used to exfoliating.  However, by the second or third use, you've become accustomed to it. The best part about this product is how absolutely smooth and soft my skin is after using it. I feel like silk! It's even managed to take care of the dull rough skin on my elbows, knees and feet. I'm not sure they'v ever been so smooth! The salux also lathers well, dries quickly and does not mildew or mold.

I wear this perfume in the fall and winter (Philosophy's Amazing Grace is my summer and spring scent) and I get so many compliments on it! Everyone loves it (including my boyfriend) and now my sister wants it, too. The description it gives of the scent is pretty accurate. It smells kind of spicy and and warm and fresh all at the same time. A very nice effect. It's strong enough that you don't need a lot to get the desired effect (Translation: don't use too much or you'll knock out your coworkers)

This fragrance packs a strong punch, so use it lightly, and spray it on your legs or abdomen, not around your neck.  This may be why some reviewers aren't fond of the scent.  You'll definitely pick up on patchouli, amber, and sandalwood.  I love wearing this when I have a big event.  I can't add anything about the atomizer; I got a normal spray bottle.

The Prada perfume was authentic and the packaging was genuine. The only problem is the picture shown on the website was not what I received.  I expected to receive the bottle with the atomizer, but it was not.  There was no way to know this from the picture or the description provided.  I highly recommend the perfume good value and smells divine.

I work as a fragrance associate and this is one of my favorites! All of the items are a treat. The body cream is heavenly... The intense is to die for!! If the fragrance is a little too "daring" for you ust the regular lotion with it and it will tame the smell. If you love this other frangrances you'll love are Cartier: Le Baiser du Dragon, and Thierry Mugler: Angel. I love them all!

 I'm going to be cheap and get the larger refillable because it's the same price as a small with the spray. I figure I can just dab it on. I was going to spend a fourtune on the one with the atomizer though seeing all the negative reviews about it, I'm glad I didn't! I'm rating it a 4 for now just based on the scent. We'll see how it works out

I am very picky about perfumes because most of the stronger-scented ones will induce my migraines. My wonderful husband purchased this perfume for me last Christmas, after I sampled it in a magazine. I love the bottle the perfume comes in, and it comes equipped with a "foo-foo" atomizer. The smell is nice and warm, and it reminds me of a winter day spent in front of the fireplace. I always get compliments when wearing the Prada scent.
The downside is that it is expensive- $95 a bottle for the larger size. But I only use it about once a week

When I used to dye my hair this was the only in-shower conditioner that gave me perfect results every time!  Not too over-ladden with oil or weighed down, but perfectly moisturized!  The only thing you may not like is the scent.  It's different than the normal floral or fruity scents most conditioners have.  I personally liked it, but I can see how some people wouldn't go for the musky, almost smoky scent that comes with most Ojon hair products.

I have used this with the Ojon shampoo and my hair's texture has improved tremendously. With the detrimental effects of Idaho's arid climate and turning 40, my thick hair has gotten coarse.  This product has been a pleasant surprise, leaving my hair smoother and softer, like we live on a coast and I'm barely 30. :-

I tried this when I got it in a gift-with-purchase, and wow! This is a fantastic foundation. Repariwear Anti Aging Makeup offers full-coverage foundation with a beautifully smooth finish. It really covers blemishes and discolorations without giving you a mask-like face. It blends smoothly and evenly, and makes a perfect base for all your color cosmetics. It lasts all day without creasing, running, or just getting yucky like other brands do. I am really impressed with it! Plus, we all need to wear foundation with SPF coverage to protect us from the sun. This one offers the best in sun protection, with doctor-recommended titanium dioxide and zinc oxide coverage to prevent wrinkles. I cannot recommend this foundation highly enough

I am a "product freak"....always looking for the best creams and lotions and such for my somewhat aging yet still "combination" skin. ( I will be 41 this spring) I got a sample of this moisturizer as part of a nifty Lancome gift-with-purchase ..and I LOVE IT!!!!!!  It absorbs quickly, isnt too watery, not too rich..not greasy feeling at ALL, and my skin just plumped right up and got VERY pink and dewy after I applied it. Very soothing feeling! Its pricey, but I highly recommend it, and will purchase this when my ( good sized!) sample runs out!

The time had come - the time for some serious reassessment of my skin and the toll time and the elements had taken on it.

 I'd read the ads for Lancome's line - ABSOLUE - which stated it was "one product that addresses the effects of chronological aging." And, IT DOES! It not only addresses those telltale signs (think fine lines, a somewhat dull appearance) but it seems to make quick work of them. 

After use my skin actually has an imrpoved texture and a "life" that seemed lacking in the past. Daily use has made a marked difference. Granted, it is not a minor investment, but it just takes a little for comfortable coverage. My guess is this jar will last me many moons!

i absolutely love these tweezers. they are extremely sharp which allows for precision removal of splinters and ingrown hairs. i also use it for eyebrow grooming because the fine point allows for single lash removal. (helps prevent pulling out too many at a time and creating a disaster) I have just ordered my third pair of these tweezers because I can't live without them! 

as stated below, the tweezers do not come with instructions. Thank goodness my education prepared me for the complicated task of using this tool... If you don't know how to use tweezers, you should probably stay away from this product. it is extremely sharp

OK, I admit the Philosophy line of products are the best I have ever used.  And trust me, I have used them all!  A self proclaimed makeup expert here!!  Just ask any of my friends.  The Philosophy Microdelivery Peel Daily Peel Pads are the best little pads to remove any lingering cleanser, and prepare your face for the Philosophy serum, and moisturizer.  These pads are just full of ingredients that help sluff off dead cells, and let your new bright cells step forward.  Once you try this product, you will never want to apply your makeup products without this first

I use these daily after cleansing my face. They are wonderful. You can feel the product working but there is no burning or stinging involved, just an invigorating toning feeling. The scent is very nice also. The pads are thin but generously saturated with solution, one pad is plenty to do my entire face &amp; neck area.

I've tried Avon's micro peel pads and found them too dry. I often used 2 or more at a time as they just weren't moist enough to do the trick. The prices are comparable and I feel you get more treatments out of the Philosphy peel pads

I jus recently purchased these pads.  I have been using Philosophy skin care for more than a year now, but was feeling like the line was needing a toner like product to help with exfoliation on a daliy basis.  Well, this is it!  The pads are very soft (also very thin).  I definately felt the product working and it made a difference.  I was thinking the product was a bit pricey, but then when I was looking at similar products from other lines, I changed my thinking.  I recommend this product

After the Bathina seductive body wash, this is a sexy cream that leaves your skin feeling silky soft without being overly moisturizing. 

This cream may be best in the summer months as it is not overly rich once applied. It will work well when you are putting on lighter fabrics like silk or anything where a rich body cream would be a disaster. The secret of this formula seems to be the sesame seed oil and cocoa butter. 

There is something powdery soft about this body cream. It has a "whispery don't tell" quality and seems to secretly sink into your skin, leaving only the most delicate hint of sweet cinnamon and faraway ocean breezes. 

The Bathina cream is much more seductive than the body wash, although the two work very well together. You may be amazed at how soft this makes your skin and the scent is delicate enough to allow for the layering of your favorite perfume. I'd recommend the Anna Sui "Sui Love" perfume because it seems to have hints of the same whispery floral beauty. 

The small "to go" size is probably good for two or three applications. I almost used half the container the first time. I'd go with the larger size even if you are buying the small body wash. I like using the body wash for bubble bath but it would also work well if you are going away for the weekend.

Just dampen a cotton ball then swish-swipe, and it's gone! 

This fabulous eye makeup remover quickly removes even racoon eyes as well as waterproof and non-waterproof mascaras - quicker then "Delete" on your keyboard! 

It's the first I've found that easily erases the glitter I love to sport for special occasions. No more pulling, tugging or irritating eyes as long as LAURA MERCIER Eye Makeup Remover is handy! 

Laura, thank you!

Just love it! Been searching for a scent like this forever! When you first put it on it has a soapy clean scent...while at the same time has hints of that "just back from the beach smell!!"
The foaming bath and shower cream is wonderful..creamy and leaves your skin feeling very soft...even good as a shampoo.
The perfumed shimmering body lotion is also wonderful...soft skin with a hint of shimmer..lovely. 
It's light and clean..a beautiful scent. Just bought it as a gift for my sister who like me has been searching for the perfect scent...think she will adore it when she gets it..just like I do!

Pleasures ( Placeres ) for Men &amp; Women!

<review_text>
Women have always been impressed with my name (Placeres); it has attracted them like flies along with the cologne (pleasures) that they find irresistible to them, bringing their fantasies to reality and enjoying a wild adventure with me when I wear the cologne.  These women range from the serious, conservative, glamorous, feminine, sexy elite type to the leather strapping tattoo bike riding, honky-tonk and the sweet cozy ladies of the night, that just want to ride and hump you all the time until you are exhausted.
I personally think that this cologne for men is the best on the market. The name itself is attractive, inviting, intriguing and very catching. All the women that I have dated have always been exited with the smell, and at the end of the night they always thanked me by saying " It's been a great experience and a pleasure, Mr. Pleasures spending the night with you"; they insist on another wild date with me adding that my name and the fragrance have made an impression on them that have resulted in their uncontrollable desires for me! The name of the cologne and my name go very well together bringing out the passion, romanticisms, and animalism with superb ecstasies on kinky dates an experience that they will always treasure claiming what a remarkable man I am. My experience on a tour to South America a few women asked permission to use my name as an advertisement to their exotic full service pleasure agencies; so if your name is not Placeres, try at least the cologne with your mates, and when they complement you, say, Pleasures were made for men and women! Take it from me, SeÃ±or Placeres (Mr. Pleasures) yo se,una buena templada when I get one!

OK, I know it is gross, but if you didn't think you had a problem with your skin then you wouldn't be on reading this right now. I have tried everything, lots of stuff isn't worth 2 cents and then there's Clinique Pore Refining Lotion. This is a must in my daily routine, I even wear it when I am sleeping. How to use: Wash face, then apply after any serums that you may use, but before moisturizer with sunscreen, primer, concealor or foundation. DO NOT PUT TOO MUCH ON if you are planning on layering makeup on top of it, as it will make your makeup flake off your skin. This is not something that you would smear all over, only on your oily areas (such as nose, chin etc). If you use it on your dry areas, it will make your face look to dry. Nobody wants face dandruff on their black turtleneck. WHAT IT DOES: makes your face appear less oily, reduces the size of pores slightly the first few times you use it, but the pores will get smaller if you use it everyday. It also feels pretty nice when you rub it on (warm and tingly). It does contain salicyclic acid, so it prevents pores from clogging. The size of the tube is huge, it will at least a month or two with daily use. I think this works better than any clean-and-clear product, better than biore pore strips, thus the more expensive price. The only bad thing about this product is that it may dry out your skin if you use it too much and cause flaky skin. One of the other benefits is that it will reduce the amount of oil that your skin produces throughout the day, thus you won't have to blot or powder pat as much as normal

i have been looking for a bronzer that was not too orange and just right for my complexion. this one works really well for me. every time i wear it i get compliments on my makeup...not on my bronzer which tells me that it is just adding the extra oomph i need to my complexion instead of looking like i added bronzer. i still use a little blush to give my cheeks an added pink. i'm hooked :

This is a fantastic product! I cannot wash my hair without it.  I am so used to this towel sucking up all the extra water that when I just use a normal bath towel it actually feels weird to have all the excess water in my hair.  This also cuts down on a lot of blowdryer time too. I have fine, medium length hair and this works fantastic for me.  I highly, highly recommend this for anyone who wants to save time on drying their hair in the morning and get out of the door faster.

If you have thick hair, or long hair, or both as I do, then this towel is for you.  It seems a little pricey for just one towel, but believe me, it's completely worth it.  I have hair that hangs about four inches below where my bra crosses my back and it is quite thick.  After ten minutes in a regular towel turban, my hair still drips profusely.  After ten minutes in the Aquis towel, the outer surface of my hair is almost dry to the touch!  Not to mention that the towel holds in a turban perfectly - normal towels are so heavy that I must keep my head upright to keep the turban in place.  With the Aquis, I can bend over or swing my head around and the turban does not come undone or fall off.  I don't like to use hair dryers because it is extremely damaging to your hair; with the Acquis, there's less need to because my hair is half dry after a few minutes in it.  Also, I've noticed that my hair has a lot more volume when I dry it with the Aquis.  I could see how people with thin or very short hair would not get the full benefit of this towel because a normal towel works well enough for them; but if you have a lot of hair, this towel is just like magic

I would never go back to using a regular towel for my hair after trying this little miracle towel. Wrap it around soaking wet hair and it absorbs amazingly. It not only cuts drying time down but makes it unneccesary to rub and rub which is damaging to the hair. They also hold up to many uses. It's really revolutionary!

I have had a 56 year quest for a product to tame my frizzy hair.  I've tried it all.  This product calms the frizz, keeps it calm until my next shampoo-something no other product has ever come close to doing before.  My hair is soft, shiny and everyone is commenting on how long my hair 
is. That is because it is so much more relaxed.  I love this stuff! Do you sell it by the gallon?  Oh, that doesn't mean you have to use a lot.  I have shoulder length hair and I use about the size of a nickel. I just don't want to ever run out!

This is the only product that keeps my hair from drying into a fuzzy, frizzy mess. I technically have straight hair, but it misbehaves a lot and is a bit unruly. This is called a balm, but it is more like a thick liquid that I apply to wet hair. With phytodefrisant I can really see the results after I blow dry. Even if I let my hair air dry, I still see less frizz and my hair is softer. I would not live without this stuff over the winter, especially with dry hair and static woes ahead

Phytodefrisant is one of the rare products that actually lives up to the hype by everyone who uses it. I have heard of it for years but never believed that spending lots of money will ensure great results when it comes to just one styling product, but even after one use I knew there was no turning back. This product is truly amazing as even one application in mid-day turned my hair into gleaming spun silk with glossy reflection and incredible softness and bounce. I can't begin to describe my surprise and adoration for Phyto for crating such a marvel of nature and science in a seemingly inconspicuous metal tube. 

The product itself is an oozing liquidy clear gel like consistency and it disappears into the hair, as I like to put it in the morning after I wash it and brush it through. It makes my hair feel slippery and silky, and I love it. Ever since I've been using it, I get random complements form friends and strangers on my hair, and even my high lights are revived as they look fresh and summery.  This really makes me hair feel luxurious and Im thrilled that I did spend the money on it, for now no matter what I do to my hair, its always a good hair day! As an added bonus I don't need anything else in my hair, which saves more time and money, it's incredible how this one product does such an incredible turn around on my mane, love it

This is my "Holy Grail" haircare product -- I could use almost any other shampoo, almost any other conditioner, almost any other hairspray, but I could *not* ever use any other styling product on my hair, now that I've had a chance to use this. There is a Very Good Reason why Phytotherathie's Phytodefrisant has long been a mainstay of top professional models &amp; has been voted the #1 haircare product by readers of "Allure" magazine more than once -- try it &amp; if you have frizzy hair I guarantee you'll understand, too.

My hair is thick, naturally wavy/curly &amp; prone to extreme frizziness in the slightest humidity, &amp; I've spent most of my post-pubescent life trying to figure out how to straighten it &amp; control the frizziness. Until I discovered Phytodefrisant, the most effective product I had found was Sebastian's "Laminates" (I've tried virtually *every* product promoted to control frizziness that's been on the U.S. market in the last 30 years), but the silicone eventually built up on my hair &amp; on very humid days I had to use so much of it that my hair was weighed down by the coating &amp; felt "dirty". It "looked" reasonably good (for most of the day), but it certainly didn't feel very good to the touch. However, letting my hair go "curly" was a non-starter because the "curls" became nothing but frizz unless the humidity was close to 100% &amp; if I used the "Laminates," it only destroyed my hair's ability to curl &amp; simply made my hair look "dirty" &amp; unstyled.

By contrast, just a teaspoon of Phytodefrisant allows me to blow-dry my hair to soft, sleek, straight smoothness, with no residue detectible at all to the touch. The first time I used it, what struck me the most was how "natural" &amp; "bouncy" my hair felt to the touch (I know, I know, I sound like a TV commercial, but this is *really* true!). I could run my fingers through my smooth, straight hair without detecting the slightest residue of the product &amp; even after a month of daily use there is absolutely *no* build up whatsoever. On days when I want to wear my hair "curly", a single teaspoon allows my hair to dry naturally into crisp, bouncy curls without the slightest evidence of frizziness all day, no matter the humidity.

My hair is shoulder-length &amp; this tube lasts me for about 6 months, which breaks down to a cost of 13 cents a day. If buying a tube for this price seems daunting, Phyto includes a small travel-size tube in its "Petites" travel collection, which would allow you to try a variety of their products &amp; which is also sold here at Amazon.com last time I checked. If you want more reviews from people who take their haircare seriously, check out the numerous rave reviews for Phytodefrisant on makeupalley dot com, where this is one of the highest rated products by a picky demographic group that takes personal care products very, very seriously! ;

...to my suprise though, it was wonderful!  I didn't buy this product on Amazon.com, I picked it up at Sephoria at the mall.  This product is a bit expensive, but so far, it's been worth it.  I've been using for 5 days now, you apply it to wet hair, after shampoing.  When you do, you can feel your hair becoming so smooth and shiny.  I love this product so far, it's all natural too and it really does work.  It isn't going to make your hair 100% straight, no, I gave up on that a long time ago.  What is it going to do is straighten the hair enough, make it managable, and beautiful.  For once, I don' thave to hide behind my hat :)  Will buy again

I have used this a total of 3 times so far and I can already see a difference.
My hair is kinky/curly/unruly. It's fair and I do highlight so I am prone to dryness on the ends.  And frizz?  My worst enemy. The real test will be when the hot/humid weather comes to town.  
But so far, so good.  It's worth every penny

This is the best smelling perfume I've ever encountered--and the only one I've gotten compliments from strangers on.  It's fresh &amp; clean--not heavy and overpowering like many other fragrances.  I keep trying other perfumes out of curiousity, but I always come back to `Happy'

I got this perfume as a gift, and I'm absolutely in love with it!  It's light, refreshing, citrusy, but it's wonderfully softened by pretty floral notes. Nicely feminine, but very contemporary and sophisticated--it's not like the heavy floral perfumes of the old days. I like it so much I went out and bought the Happy body wash--it just brings my mornings alive and takes some of the pain out of getting up for work.  I also bought the Happy body lotion which I smooth on after my shower.  This gives me a fragrance foundation that I then top off with the perfume.  It's a wonderful way to set out into the world, wrapped in a beautiful, light, refreshing fragrance, and it's not overpowering for everyone else--in fact, I've gotten lots of compliments on my perfume.  It's nice to be noticed!

This is excellent lip gloss. I agree with the previous reviewer. It lasts for a very long time, doesn't feel sticky or liquidy, and doesn't taste bad. Unfortunately, the price is painful at which to look and on the wallet, but it's worth it. I've only tried one color (because of the price) and I think it works very well with my natural skin tones (I use 'Cry Baby'). Next time you're looking for a new lip gloss, check out this one. It's definitely worth it

This lip gloss is so wonderful, I don't know where to start.  Long lasting shine, perfect color, goes on smooth-doesn't feel sticky or gummy like some glosses do, mild fruity flavor.  I HIGHLY recommend this lip gloss to anyone-the expense is worth it 100X over

I love this cologne.It has a great first spray smell and smells even better when you let it sit for a while. I like to were it when i work out cause when i start to sweat the smell gets stronger. I'm no scientist but this is the only cologne that has ever done that for me. I honestly come out of the gym smelling better then when i went in. I love this colonge and it drives girls crazy!!!!!!!!!!

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this lip balm.  It has a great texture- doesn't get gooy or sticky after you wear it for a while.  It really melts into your lips.  I have tried A LOT of different lip products- I always have to have something on my lips and this is the best I've tried.  Can't live without it..

This super balm makes my lips so soft. I usually put it on right before bed, because the taste is kind of nasty, but I forget about my slight taste-discomfort after I wake up with the most supple lips imaginable. No matter how flaky your lips are, Kiss Me conquers all! This is especially good for before/during/after skiing or snowboarding. It's also good for summer as it is somewhat light. I reccomend it, but beware if you get nauseated easily as the taste is enought to do it to you

I LOVE THIS LINE, ESPECIALLY THIS FRAGRANCE. I HAVE PEOPLE ROUTINELY ASK ME WHAT I AM WEARING. ONCE YOU START WEARING THIS LINE OF FRAGRANCE YOU WILL BE HOOKED. I ALSO LIKE PURE GRACE, IT SMELLS LIKE FRESH LINEN OFF THE CLOTHES LINE. THESE ARE THE TWO MOST UNBELIEVABLE SCENTS. TRY IT AND  YOU WON'T BE SORRY. I AM ON MY FOURTH BOTTLE AND I HAVE BEEN WEARING IT FOR ONLY A YEAR! 
IT IS NOT OBTRUSIVE, MY CO-WORKERS AND PATIENTS COMMENT ON THE CLEANLINESS OF THE SMELL. NOT FLOWERY, FRUITY, OR MUSKY. A SMELL ALL ITS OWN.

I received a sample of the Amazing Grace Shampoo,Bath and Shower Gel and was smitten by the singularly heavenly scent!  This prompted me to order a full-sized bottle.  Then I had to have the fragrance to layer with it, so I ordered this.  It's the best! It's like no other scent on the market: very clean and sexy. I've recently added the conditioner to the mix...it's hard to stop

This stuff does exacatly what it says. I have put in on for the past 2 weeks 2x a week. I have a mild case of acne and it seems to get rid of the oil in my skin really well. One thing I will say is that it does dry out your skin. I also sort of wonder why there has to be so many oils and stuff like that in it. I guess it all works together somehow. Overall a very good cleanser.

Sexy, young, VERY sweet..a little bit overbearing if not applied with a light touch. A little goes a long way. Absolutely adorable bottle! ( definitely one you don't throw away)  To me this scent is best described as " cotton candy with an attitude!" I have to be in a certain "mood" to wear this one, but..it IS one of my favorites!

I have worn Lolita for many years,  and everyone always wants to know what I am wearing because they love it.  I have had 2 X-boyfriends, that I am still friends with, tell me they have never forgotten the smell of my perfume.  One of these guys dates back to college and I have been outta there for 8 years now.  I broke down and told them the name of  " that smell they loved" because they want to buy it for their new significant others.  The scent made an incredible impression on me,  but apparently on the other people that have been in my life as well. The scent is dark, seductive, and delicate at the same time.  I notice the scent changes more as the day wears on which I love because it only gets better.  I am told this is called the dry down phase.  Of course I am no professional perfumer,  but out of my collection of scents,  this one is my Annie Hall.... beautiful but different..  and not to be missed.

Now i'm a guy, but I buy this for my best friend back home whenever she runs out. Why? Cause from the male side of it, its literally the best fragrance I've ever had the pleasure to smell on a woman. And once you've experinced this smell guys, you'll never forget it. So don't waste time and go spend the cash and by your girl this gift

I like it, but it is VERY sweet and VERY strong.  Cute bottle, too--best I have seen in ages.  Probably should be worn by younger (than I) women and not if they are going to be riding in a plane or an elevator.  This scent elicits some strong reactions

This is one of my all-time favorite scents. If you love dark fairy tales and you like deep, rich fragrances that last but are not overpowering, this is for you. Wearing this is like entering a shimmery gothic dream. For me the best aspect of this fragrance is the slight licorice undertone, which gives it an edge I haven't come across in another fragrance. And did I mention it's romantic? Just look at the amethyst and gold apple bottle! They're too pretty to get rid of

I love the Brazil Nut Body Butter! I really do, so Im glad youve asked for my review! It absorbs quickly and aids in dry skin healing immediately. I like to layer it a few times over the course of an hour or so. I just cant live without it actually. I had tried with failure, alot of different moisturizers on the market over the years, wasting a ton of money on what I would say is basically false advertising of products that are mostly water and wax based, and was given this butter a few years ago by a friend and have been ordering it ever since. It pays for itself with the first use, and is not only excellent for dry hands but legs and well, just about anywhere you want healed, soft real skin again. I use it on my cuticles after manicures and have instant results there too! I totally recommend it to anyone who just cant get their dry skin to heal and be truly soft. Its not to heavy for summer use either, its just perfect

This mirror is super for tweezing and applying makeup.  So many of the magnifying mirrors are not that sharp.  This one is.  Very handy, it has two suction cups on the back so you can attach it to any mirror, so you always have the kick check to make sure to mascara doesn't end up like Tammy Fay Baker.

Very highly recommended

When I first saw CURIOUS while on holiday, I bought it without trying any. I just wanted the pretty bottle. When I opened it up back home I didn't have high hopes, impulse buying rarely works out does it? So what did I think?

I love it. My first thought was; Sophisticated and classic. CURIOUS can be worn for work, shopping, evenings out - anywhere at any time! 

On the first spay you notice the top notes of magnolia and lotus flower, then the dreamy base of vanilla-infused musk, which lasts throughout the day. The best surprise of all?   After you've worn it for a few hours, you are surprised with the mouth-watering aroma of tangy pear.

As a model, I often have to do my own makeup for my photoshoots. MAC StudioFix Powder is one of my favorite products, as it is a light-weight product with light to medium coverage that I use on top of heavier coverage foundations to provide a matte finish and a tiny bit of extra coverage. 

One of my favorite features is the fact that there is such a wide selection of shades to match virtually any skintone. As recommended on Asianbeautyblog.com for my Asian skintone, I can use C35 and NC35 pretty interchangably - both are yellow based shades, though I find that C35 is more natural looking when used alone because of its golden/olive undertones. There are few other companies that offer such a wide range of shades, especially ones that suit ethnic skintones. I love MAC

MMMMMM Roses. Like a bath in a rose garden- and not that cheap perfumey fake rose smell, its a rich, real, natural rose oil smell. It leaves your skin soft and smelling lightly of roses. A wonderful before-bed soak! We slept like babies. I like that it isn't full of unnecessary colors. Mine was crumbling a little when it arrived, but who really cares- it still does the job. There's nothing more perfect for a Valentines evening

This is a definately must have for rose lovers, the fragrance isn't overwhelming (but if you do find it to be so, you can just use half of the bomb). One tip for all the flower bits is to put this in a old pantyhose (or a mesh bag type of thing) so you don't have to clean the tub afterwards

I have been trying tinted moisturizers and looking for one that suited me since Estee Lauder discontinued their Fresh Air Moisture Tint. I loved that one (in fresh sunlight) as it was just enough to give me a hint of color and worked well with my skin. I have rosacea and experience break outs from many products. I haven't had any problems with the Clinique Sheer Tint (in Neutral) and I am very happy with the lightweight feel of this make-up. As the name implies, this product only gives a sheer tint, it evens out some flaws but does not give nearly as much coverage as most foundations. I like the light coverage as it gives me a more natural look and feel

  Ever since I was a kid I've been using my dad's Hugo cologne. This cologne has a scent that doesn't get old. I should also mention that I own lots of colognes and this is still my favorite. Like the other reviewer said I don't think the amazon description really describes this cologne. You should just go out and try it out. Hugo boss has also came out with other colognes which I've been dissapointed about. Some are good but they can't ever beat the original hugo. Take my advice and buy Hugo

I have been mostly a Calvin Klein cologne supporter the last few years but a few months ago I gave Hugo a try.  I gotta say that I really dig it.  I don't know about it being the scent of "northern air, deep rich forests, and surf crashing against a rugged coastline", but it smells good.  And the old lady likes it.  Not to sound gay but the scent is light, not heavy like CK's Obsession, and it hangs around for a good while unlike alot of the lighter colognes that seem to disappear after a few hours.  

If you haven't tried it, you should.  You'll like it and so will the old ball and chain

Laura Mercier's Metallic Creme Eye Colour is the best eye shadow I had ever worn. I have it in Gold and will soon purchase another Gold and the Barnished Cooper. I wear this eye color every day because it lasts through out the day, no need to re-apply and no creases (which is a plus). Don't let the size or price of the tube discourage you from purchasing this product. This product should last a good six or more months depending on how much you use and you don't need to use a lot because this stuff is highly pigmented (love that). I don't regret buying it at all, it's the best creme eye shadow out there

Just a little pump of this stuff each day keeps your skin nice and clean, but not too dry. I have sensitive skin that tends to get oily--Olivella has been great. So many products overdry, not this stuff. I highly recommend it. 

By the way, my husband uses it too. We've had our bottle for 8 or 9 months--a little goes a long way, so it's pretty economical. Smells pleasant, too

I was a skeptic and not a mother, but was still told that this cream is meant for anybody with stretch marks. So I had to try this stuff out. I was so amazed that this stuff started working in a few days. When I noticed such quick fading of the stretch markes around my stomach and my shoulder joints I was impressed I could actually see normal skin, I was thrilled and have told everybody I know about this stuff. This stuff is also good for dry skin and sunburns, I had to test out the possibilities and the stuff works like magic. I don't know how they formulated this stuff but after all these years somebody finally got it right

As a rule,I never buy fragrances named after women but for Paris Hilton I make an exception - I LOVE her fragrances! They have persistent high topnotes and are long lasting. I also bought both her Colognes for Men for my husband and he loves them too! In fact he goes through his faster than I go through mine. These fragrances also make great gifts.

My boyfriend wears this cologne and I love it.  It's not too overpowering and he still smells great at the end of the day.  It has a slight vanilla scent that is not sweet but I think it's what makes the cologne "warm".  Rumor has it this scent may be discontinued, which will make us both unhappy...... I'm stocking up for him now, just in case

Hugo Boss in Motion is definitely one of the secrets of many modern men. The fragrance is alluring and seductive. It is long lasting and easily recognized by above average women. If you want to get noticed especially among women you will want to get this one

I really like this product and the only thing keeping me from marking it 5 stars is the fact that it makes my skin feel sticky for a while after I put it on.  The smell stays around for a long while which is great!  I reccomend this product if you like the smell of cinnamon, it's so homey and comforting!  :)

Instead of indulging in one of those fabulously aromatic concoctions of sugar, cinnamon, flour and white frosting hawked in every airport food court in the country, buy yourself a jar of this whipped body soufflÃ© that accurately mimics the irresistibility of the smell without the worry of all those extra calories or the concern that your friends may think that too much overtime has been accrued rolling out dough at the bakery.

This light emulsion goes on smooth, sinks into the skin within seconds, leaves none of the stickiness attributed to the real deal and converts into an actual perfume with cinnamon notes. Rather than doling out an overdose of cinnamon bun hot from the oven, the initial scent morphs to something light but lingering -- not cloying---you will be soft and feel as delicious and delectable as you smell. 

As I am tempted to apply it more than once a day, my only complaint may be that the jar is too small and will not last as long as I would like.

Nevertheless, Philosophy has come up with a calorie free treat that allows you to have your cake without eating it. 

Recommended to all those who like a fresh light scent that generates a warm feeling of yum.  Not recommended to those who may have extremely sensitive skin as one user that I know complained of a slight rash that appeared after using it on the skin under her arms

Great eyebrows ALONE can change your entire look. They are to your eyes what a great frame is to a Rembrant and THIS product by Laura Geller is the ULTIMATE in eyebrow perfection; a mascara for your brows that grooms, lifts, tames, colors, and--with it's marvelous tiny fibers embedded in the tint--fills in sparse, thin or thinning brows in as little time as it takes to do your lashes. I've often seen people mistaken for having their hair done or losing weight or some other major aesthetic improvement when all they did was have their eyebrows groomed--it's THAT important. THIS product replaces all the brow pencils, powders and brushes of the past and it's all you'll ever need to get those elegant, sophisticated, perfect brows seen on the glamorous actresses of the 40's and 50's films. It may take a few patient practice applications but anyone can become a expert with this product. After you've filled in and colored your brows with the color right for you, use the clear end to brush in a perfect all day hold. I recommend using a magnifying mirror while you're applying for a flawless application. As long as this product is around, I'll never be without it again

If you have any issues with hair loss or dry scalp issues, this will heal and soothe the scalp and possibly nourish the hair at the roots (I find this to be true with essential oils). 

This is the product to reach for in the dryness of winter when you are looking for just about anything to calm your scalp and keep in the moisture. The surprising aspect of this conditioning product is how deeply cleansed and nourished your scalp will feel. It also deeply moisturizes your hair like a conditioning treatment. 

One thing about this product is that it is super rich and it may take as many as four shampoos to get this out of your hair. I'd suggest trying this at night in the bath, washing it out twice and then putting your hair up for the night. That way, you don't have to worry about it until the next time you wash your hair the following day. I think of this as a sort of overnight treatment, even though I wash it out right after using it. 

This can be used as a preventative treatment once a week. Almond oil, nettle extract, rosemary, beeswax, papaya, menthol, peppermint, lavender, rose, juniper, salicylic acid make this a winner. I'll be ordering this one again!

I have fair skin and have a very hard time finding foundations that are the right the color, it seems like everything is either to dark or to yellow.  After the last two brands I used cancelled my foundation shade I finally broke down and decided I would just have to go with a more expenssive foundation.  I sales clerk at Sephora recomended Vincet Longo to me as the best foundation they carry and I am so glad she did.  I use golden porcelin if I have been in the sun lately and porcelin if I have not.  The coverage is on the sheer side, so it is not heavey or cakey.  Because it is a little bit sheer you could probably wear a shade that is not an exact match and not have that mask look.  Most people can't tell when I am wearing this foundation and when I'm not.  Usually if anyone comments on my skin while I am wearing it it is to complement my skin and ask what cleansers and lotions I have been using. In my oppinion that is the reaction a good foundation should get.  I also love that that it is SPF 15, because as fair as I am my face burns pretty easily.  The dew finish is not shiney like some some dew finishes, just not matte.  Plus it contains ceramide 3, chamomile, vitamins E and C, all of which are supposed to sooth skin, protect it and improve texture.  I was not looking for a water proof foundation, and I have not tried it while swimming so I don't know if it stays on.  I will definatly be buying more Vincent Longo products.  I just hope they don't cancel or change my shades and I have to buy an even more expensive brand of foundation

This is wonderful!  The scent is like no other.  I am so glad that I decided to experience this fragrance...it reminds me of pineapple, citrus...and other notes.  I can truly say that this has just become my signature scent.  I also purchased the Blue Orchidee which also smells wonderful.  I actually layered both scents and it just heightened my fragrance experience.  What more can I say...Wonderful!!! :-

I am in my 50's.  Throughout my life I have used many mascara's and this is the only one that doesn't give the panda eyes with a few hours.  It washes off very easily.  The only problem I have with it and it's a very minor problem is that when I put it on, no matter how careful I am I always blink and it gets on my skin (lower lid).  It also has a tendency to drop a few dust flakes which I need to remove with a q-tip.  It's true you can go swimming in it because it is not waterproof, but for everyday it's the best.

I purchased this fragrance last summer and I as well as alot of other people around me love this fragrance. It smells like a light breezy day at the beach. It is perfect for the daytime and also works well for the evening. 
If you cant stand strong fragrances this might be for you. I am a nurse at a nursing home and this does not bother my older patients at all. As they are sometimes sensitive to strong smells. 
It also last for about 4 or 5 hours which is a good thing for me

The other person who reviewed "Happy" by Clinique is incorrect. There is no musk undertone in this perfume. I know because my body chemistry brings out the musky undertones in any fragrance whatsoever, regardless of if it maybe perfume, body spray, lotions, whatever. Instead this fragrance is light and flowery with citrus undertones. Additionally, the scent lasts all evening. I can put on a light spray at the beginning of the evening, go to a smoky club with a punk rock band, drink, get in a fight, have a roll in the hay and still smell like Happy in the morning!

This is the only perfume my fiance really loves to smell, and contrary to another person's review, it lasts longer than many perfumes of the same quality and price.  Its subtle, citrus nuances make it ideal for cuddling and nibbling, especially since it won't overpower or leave any taste residue.  

Delightful

I absolutely love this perfume. Whenever I have it on people always ask me what I am wearing! It has a citrusy floral note to it so it smells crisp and clean. I wear a lot of different perfumes- but I think a bottle of this lasted me over a year (a little goes a long way.

I think I smell the citron the most in this scent. At first I thought is was similar to grapefruit and then I got the fine balance of other tones. Beautiful and light scent. Look for a good deal on it though, pricing varies greatly

This product goes on silky smooth and (just like they say) produces a bright metallic sheen on the eyelid.  It's awesome

        Bonanza!  Urban Decay has broken the bank - not at Monte Carlo but of makeup with the new Precious Metal Eye Sheens.  They're ultra smooth with a cream to powder formula and stay on and on and on.  A subtle glisten of metallic gives eyes a wide awake look by day and a sexy come hither gleam by night.

	The Eye Sheens come in four different shades which you can either apply simply to the corner of your eyes or smudge all over the lid.  Try "Big Thicket" for an innocent lavender, or "Loaded" for a full throttle jade.  "Platinum" is a sheer sliver of silver, and "Trust Fund" a super sapphire.

	You know what a girl's best friends are,  and these Sheens come in dazzling diamond shaped cubes.  Which is all to say these eye colors are gems.

        - Gail Cook

What's so great about this product is that it allows you to look fresh without trying too hard.  The colors are soft and radiant and the brush is great, very soft and easy on the skin.  I love it

Ojon is a great brand for hair.  The main thing you should look out for is use very, very little of the restorative treatment...It is very oily and in turn will make your hair smooth, yes but quite oily looking.  Once you get used to how much you should use for your hair type - you will LOVE the product!  Take a chance, if you want smooth, silky hair

This is by far the best-smelling cologne i've ever purchased. Vera Wang shut alot of competition with this one because unlike many fragrances on the market today, Vera Wang for Men offers a sweet, minty, long-lasting scent that is very distinct and wearable by men of all ages. I recommend this fragrance mostly for evenings, but i'm sure any man today who cares anything about how he smells can pull it off during the day. It starts off with a thin stream of mint and amber and finishes with a touch of pine and soft julip. Great fragrance and my personal favorite, it'll leave you breathless

This fragrance has something about it that seems very addicting to wear.  It is for a distingusied and sophisticated person.  I love to wear this one when taking the wife out to eat or enjoying the evening with her.  She loves the scent on me as it last for several hours. This fine fragrance contains Green Mandarin Leaf, Yuzu, Nutmeg, Viantge Leather, Anise, Sandalwood, Tobacco.  I highly recommend this one to the distinguished man.  This one is definately a hidden treasure and when your done with the bottle I'm sure you'll hurry to get another one, like I will

I am 51 and recently visited an upscale retail store in Manhattan.  The Yves St Laurent gal behind the cosmetic counter noticed my complexion was a little sallow - put this product about an inch on each side of my nose and blended it in..what a difference it made...a worthwhile investment..I use it under my eyes and just about all over my face for a nice touch-up, concealer and brightener..covers freckles and sun spots, too

Awesome product - best concealer I've ever used.  It is lightweight and does not settle into the under eye "creases" that my almost 50-year-old eyes have.  The pink undertone brightens and lightens.

This is the BEST shampoo/body wash I have ever smelled!  I can't wait to shower - just to use this product.  I am very picky about hair products -  and this is an A++++ product. It worked well on my thick corse hair and was creamy as a body wash. The only thing missing is conditioner and lotion for after the shower!  I do like the cin buns - but this is sooooo much better!!!!!!  You MUST try this product

This is the cutest packaged eyeshadow on the market.  The brush sits down in the shadow for the perfect amount of powder gets on it.  If you don't get much shadow on the tip, just shake the bottle a little and the brush fills up with more for a more dramatic effect.  Unlike with other loose eyeshadow powders that you have to use your own brush with, this doesn't get too much on the brush or your eyelid and it's easy to layer.  It has a fantastic shimmer to it and each color looks good on my skin color (which is REALLY RARE with most cosmetics)  I can't tell you how much I love this stuff!  So go ahead and buy it, and don't forget to shake the bottle with the cap on and brush in each time you apply so that the powder re-dispursts in the bottle.  :

I'm always skeptical of "age defying" products, but this one really works.  I've been using it since it first came out (maybe 10 years?) and people often think I'm younger than I am (27).  I'm not really using it for that though - I use it because it is unreal how good it is with acne.  It prevents breakouts and also heals current pimples SO fast.  When I run out, the breakouts are back

I have been on a hunt for years to find the best mascara out there! This is definatly on the top of my list. I recommend this product its great and long lasting, but the only thing I didn't like about it was that at the end of the day it started flaking a little bit. Other than that its one of the best mascaras on the market

For the past several years, I've been using mineral powders on my sensitive, acne-prone face instead of liquid makeup. I liked some better than others, but then I tried this powder from Clinique. It's fantastic! Seems more natural than any other makeup I've tried, and it can go from extremely sheer to as much coverage as you could possible want, by just adding more.

I love it

I agree with everyone!! It feels as if you're not wearing any make-up. Also it is the best powder/foundation for everyday use. I hate wearing foundation since it almost always feels that I am wearing a mask. But this is the total opposite. Also make sure you get the right shade. I recommend trying 2-3 of their shades to see which one suits you. This is a definitely a MUST HAVE

This new compact base by Clinique is THE BEST face makeup - liquid or powder - I've EVER tried.  And believe me - I've tried bazillions of them (even pricier brands)!  It covers amazingly well.  My face tends toward redness, so I got a yellow based shade (104) and it evens out my skin perfectly while covering all redness.  It goes on like an ever-so-slightly creamy powder and is SUPER EASY to apply with no goofs.  It manages NOT to look powdery on, although basically matte in nature.  It mimics perfect skin.  I went out with friends last night with this stuff on and they kept complimenting my skin!  I told them it was this makeup and they were surprised I had makeup on at all.  Kudos to Clinique for coming up with wearable, PERFECT skin!  A dream come true!  Comes in a pretty (although not particularly cute or memorable,) nice quality compact with separate sponge compartment and a good quality sponge

I've tried a lot of compacts to find that combination of coverage yet natural looking.  Before Clinique's Perfectly Real Compact, I used Bare Minerals.  In order to get the coverage I wanted, it took a long time and after couple applications with the brush my skin started to dry out and saw little bits of flake.  
With the Clinique compact, it's quick and totally natural looking with great coverage.  I use the sponge in the areas where I need a little bit more coverage and then use a brush for the rest of my face.  It's really great.  My face doesnt look like makeup is caked on.  
But WARNING; if you DO NOT know your color, I recommend going to a couple different department stores and getting consultations about the perfect color for your skin.  When I went to find the color of my compact, I got recommendations ranging from 104 to 116. Some workers really don't know what they're talking about. I ended up buying 106 and this one worker recommended 116, which is a HUGE difference. Really try to find the perfect color because your skin will look more natural and money and time wouldn't be wasted

Since Marshall Fields had a gift with purchase for Clinique, I ran right out and got this today. I was able to find my exact skin color match in shade 114(N). My skin is fair with yellow undertones. This went on smoothly and silkly with no powder streaks/marks as I seem to get with other powder foundations. This foundation has no smell and I feel like I have nothing on my face. I think they have a winner here with this foundation!

Karma smells just like a head shop to me. You have to decide for yourself if that floats your boat or not. The powder smells even more delicious than the perfume. My only problem with it is the texture. It's slightly gritty. I wish they would fix that. It may sound strange, but also, if you use the powder in white undies, it will color them orange..

I love Karma. It's one of my favorite scents. I smell more orange and gardenia than I do patchouli, though. It's a very sweet, vibrant scent, without being too sweet and candy-like. I have had no problems with it being gritty or anything like that. I use a powder puff I bought for it, so there have been no problems applying it. I just love this stuff, and it goes further for the money than the soap does, too

I wear the scent all the time and people compliment me on it. To the lady who stated that the scent is faint and she has to scramble for another perfume, maybe it the scent just doesn't mesh well with her.

It's not interesting enough that it would be my signature fragrance, but it's great for casual, everyday wear. The scent is light, flirty, but never overpowering. I REALLY recommend the body lotion. It makes my skin so soft and leaves a subtle glittery shimmer that lasts all day

This is the best hair care product for naturally curly hair...I was so bummed when the company discontinued "curly head"...I have spent thousands(LITERALLY) on hair care stylers,conditioners, etc...it leave curls defined, hair frizz fear, smells great and it is so light! I do not even use conditioner or any other styling product when I use this...just shampoo and a few drops(I comb through) and air dry....hear it is great on straight hair too

personally my hair is curly super thick and always ends up dry or undefined or fluffy or frizzy or hard stiff and sticky from products and never gets defined with other serums...but not this one! I know it is expensive and wish the amount was bigger but it is worth its weight!!!

This is truly the best in highlighting products and I have tried many high end and cheaper products out there.  This is so light and just doesn't get all cakey and greasy.  I have tried so many brands that claim to look natural, but they just don't.  This really does and don't let the price fool you either.  It only takes alittle and lasts a long time, so well worth the price for the look it gives.  I love this!

I am 51 and recently visited an upscale retail store in Manhattan.  The Yves St Laurent gal behind the cosmetic counter noticed my complexion was a little sallow - put this product about an inch on each side of my nose and blended it in..what a difference it made...a worthwhile investment..I use it under my eyes and just about all over my face for a nice touch-up, concealer and brightener..covers freckles and sun spots, too

Awesome product - best concealer I've ever used.  It is lightweight and does not settle into the under eye "creases" that my almost 50-year-old eyes have.  The pink undertone brightens and lightens.

I couldn't disagree more with the previous revue.  I've been using the original StriVectin-SD for almost a year and have been very pleased with the results.  No, all my lines did not disappear but they have gotten noticably reduced as evidenced by the comments I've gotten from friends and coworkers.  My only problem with the original formula was that it irritated my eyes.  I was very pleased to discover that StriVectin had already come out with an eye cream to combat this very problem.  It is exactly the same as the original formula except it does not contain the mint extract as that is what was causing people to have adverse reactions around the eye area.  So now I start with the StriVectin-SD Eye Cream around my eyes and crowsfeet then I apply original Strivectin-SD to the rest of my face and I'm set.  No more eye irritation and my skin looks great

A short history!! The House of Creed is one of the oldest perfume manufacturers in the world and was founded in 1760 by James Henry Creed. The House of Creed quickly became a favorite among the English Court and Queen Victoria appointed the House of Creed the official perfume supplier. The House of Creed also became popular with other royals too!

Alright, so Himalya was created for men. I'm a woman and have  fallen in love with this classic scent and enjoy wearing it myself. Himalaya is one of my personal favorites made by the House of Creed (however I'm pretty partial too all the scents created for both men &amp; women by the House of Creed). 

According to the descriptions I've found, Himalaya is a blend of mandarin, grapefruit, sandalwood, cedarwood, amber, pepper and tonka musk. I feel Himalaya has a rich, smooth, classic scent that will never go out of style. This fragrance is concentrated, so a little goes a long way and the scent lasts a long time without having to be re-applied. I have received plenty of compliments on this fragrance when I've worn it

Well I love the scent, and it makes the skin soft, reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish the scent was a bit stronger to where I could smell it without putting My nose to the skin.  I will buy it again, just wish they'd make the scent more appearent.

The Silk Elixir is a great leave-in conditioner.  It does not weigh down my curls or leave any kind of residue.  It has UV protection, which is a bonus.  It makes my hair soft and my curls smooth.  It is a little expensive, but a little bit of product goes a long way

I really like the Hard Candy Lip Gloss Ring! 

Fist off, the cute packaging makes it both fun and easy to wear (I like clunky things like that). The ring fits my finger, which is about a size 6.5/7 or so.

Secondly, the actual gloss is pretty good. However, that's also the reason why I only gave it four stars. The gloss doesn't last that long, and certainly doesn't taste that good. It isn't extremely shiny, however it is pretty moisturizing.

All in all, I recomend this as a cute gift topper or stocking stuffer for anyone who wears lip gloss or cute rings like this. I personally think it's worth it just for the container, but the actual gloss is nothing to write home about

I wasn't sure how I would fare with this product, but I am so glad I tried it! Here's a tip: I used first aid tape (the fabric kind, not the kind with really sticky adhesive) and I taped the stencil onto my brow. It took a little maneuvering to position the stencil at just the right place, but I taped the stencil down and brushed the powder on. Then I did the other eye. I  recommend using the stencils on both sides first and then doing the plucking, because I tried plucking right after removing the stencil on the first side, and I actually overplucked a tiny bit. (I was able to mask the almost indetectable difference in the two sides this morning when I put my makeup on by using just a teeny bit of the brown powder and the wax...I live in Texas and even in the humidity the powder stayed put and did not smudge!) Overall, this is not a snap to use, but definitely worth the effort, and I even got compliments on my brows from my coworkers who thought I had had them done professionally. I bought this kit for the price of having my brows waxed twice at a salon. I am very happy with the purchase and would highly recommend it

After spending a good hour playing with Anastasia's eyebrow colors at Sephora, I decided to give it a go and bought the Brunette ex-press kit. The colors are a bit dark for my golden, med brown hair, but if you go lightly, it looks better. I had bought her tweezers a month before and could not stop raving about how great there were compared to my tweezermans. So, her signature eyebrows color had to be just as good or at least almost as good as the real thing (Anastasia, herself). The Stencils were intimidating at first, I had to take a deep breath before plucking the hair outside the stencil outline. But once I was done, my eyebrows looked great! Like a mini-eyebrow lift; couldn't believe how much removing hairs from my already sparse eyebrows, could look better. Worth the buy

After months of wanting, I finally ordered it.  I am brunette, but ordered the blonde coloring as I have very fair skin and light eyes.  Glad I did!  The darker of the blonde colors was perfect, any darker and it would have looked fake.  It's a little awkward using the stencils, but I managed fine.  Try them all out- the first three were never going to work on me, the last one I tried was a near perfect fit.  

I love the finished look- I didn't have a lot to pluck, but now my eyebrows look much neater.  My hair grayed very early in life, and now my stupid brows have gray and white hairs running through them- the powder covers that up nicely.  I didn't realize how aging my brows were to my face till I used this!

My only gripe is there is very little information with the kit- just minimal instructions on the back of the small box.  The website had a little more detail, and a few photos.  I could find no help with color choice- for the high price, I would hate to goof and get the wrong coloring for my skin type.  I am glad I went with the blonde

I saw her on Oprah and immediately wanted this kit for my unruly, thick brows. I have always struggled to maintain a nice arched shape and always mess up the plucking of my brows. It is a bit difficult to use the plastic shapers by myself, but they have helped me a lot to see the correct shape to pluck. The shading powder is really helpful for shaping too. It's a sleek little compact kit and has helped me with at home maintenance

This product is good. The only problem is that the eyebrow tint looks kind of weird on the part where you don't have eyebrows. I only use it when I am putting on a lot of makeup, otherwise it looks kind of fake for everyday use. The coloring is really good for blondes

I, too, was an unbeliever.  After 29 years of Erno Laszlo products for my oily skin, my complexion is quite good. I haven't even tried a moisturizer of any kind for over 20 years.  Creme de la Mer is a revelation. It's not too heavy or oily for my skin, it heals OVERNIGHT those pesky little "bumps" that still pop up from time to time, and I love how it makes my face look! People guessed my age 10 years less before I used this product, now . . . they will never believe the truth

Ive tried all the supposed best of the moment,breakthrough skin care,anti-aging,anti-wrinkle products in the past 5 yrs,and I just keep going back to La Mer.I use other products for at least six months to reap their full benefits,and honestly,my skin looks its most radiant and best when Im back with La Mer.I just stopped trying out other products now since its only La Mer that brings the best results.My skin always looks radiant and dewey.In terms of wrinkle improvement,there will only be a cosmetic change due to the fact that your skin will look moist,which lessens the appearance of lines.Lines are pronounced when skin is dry,thus all moisturizers work on keeping the skin moist which gives you the illusion of less lines.But this product is truly the best among all!!!Nothing else

Yes, it is about $100 for an ounce, but that should last you a few months... and this stuff really is amazing. I find it so funny that so many reviews obsess about how expensive this is. Yes, it cost more than a lot of creams, but $100 every few months for glowing skin is NOT much in my book. No one complains when people spend that much on their hair, and dinner with wine at a good restaurant is more expensive! I think my face is worth it. Be sure to use the spatula, and warm it between your fingers prior to application

I was the kid who had horrible acne as a teenager and mild scarring as an adult. My hormones went wild after my daughter was born and this stuff was a miracle!  The texture of my skin is perfect. I have people constantly say how gorgeous my skin is- then I have to confess that it's completely the La Mer. WELL worth the money- the 1 oz lasts about four months so really you're not paying anymore than you would for Clinique etc that doesn't get the job done. Invest in La Mer, give it a few months, and you'll have amazing skin

So many volumizing shampoos just leave fine hair limp; this manages to both soften hair and give it fullness at the same time.  I'm not a fan of spending this much on a product but when something works so well, it's worth coming back to.  It doesn't take much to get great cleaning; the volume and shine are wonderful.  Well worth the price!

My daughters and I have naturally curly hair and this stuff is a life saver. It gives shine, and hold without stiffness. It creates very soft looking curls. The only thing is a little goes a long way. It can give a greasy appearance if you put too much, or put it to close to your scalp. We usually go down about an inch from our roots. It also leaves your hair touchable without that gross grimy feeling on your hands.

I've tried a lot of hair products to tame my very huge and very thick, natural afro, and CD's Mimosa Hair Honey is one of my favorites. I use it as a sheen for my natural curls as well as to balance my dry scalp. It's a little thick, but if you have very course &amp; dry hair, then this product is definitely what you need.

If you're like me and your scalp itches like crazy after you get your color done, Nioxin System Scalp Therapy is the answer. (The numbers only represent the type of hair you have, use a lower number if your hair is more fine.)

Use this once or two times after color, and the scalp itch goes away. 

The product claims to help thinning hair. I have no issue with that, and I think I found an "off-market" use for the product, but it works for me so I'll take it

I use this the first day or two after getting my hair colored, as my scalp is always irritated from the color.  It calms my scalp down and immediately feels better, plus it makes my hair look great from the oils!  I like the scent and couldn't do without this for my hair

I usually use the "New! (hair)" shampoo bar but decided to try this one during a recent online shopping spree on Lush's site.  I LOVE the smell, the scent seems to linger in my hair all day whereas the "New!" shampoo bar doesn't so much and my hair did seem a bit more manageable and soft after use that what it is normally so I would most definitely recommend it!  I will likely stick with my "New!" shampoo primarily but will order this again in the future for sure

If you haven't tried a solid shampoo before, you definitely should! Great for camping, travelling, bringing to the gym, or just using as an everyday shampoo. To cut down on bringing a whole bag full of bath products to the gym, I use this as a shampoo AND soap, and it works wonderfully for both purposes.

This shampoo leaves my hair FAR less tangled than most shampoos I use, so if you don't often have to use conditioner, you probably won't need it if you use this shampoo! 

The smell, of course, is grand - if you've smelled other karma-scented products from Lush, you'll know this. It's a unisex kind of scent, so I have to fight over it with my husband when we travel. MUCH better than those little bottles of foul-smelling shampoo and bath gel you get at most hotels. The earthy, citrusy smell of lemongrass, orange, lavendar, and pine is a wonderful way to wake up in the morning.

If you go to a Lush store, you can usually get a free tin to store your shampoo bars in if you buy 2 bars

This is my all time favorite of the LUSH line!  The scent is hard to describe.. and I wasn't too crazy about it when I first bought it, but it has come to be one of my most favorite scents!  I'm hooked!  This is also the only shampoo that the smell stays in your hair ALL day, even after using Conditioner.. It's so light and fresh..  simply amazing.

This shampoo is amazing.  A rub of the bar over your hands or at the roots of your hair and you have a head of lather.  Far, far better than I expected.  And  someone always comments on the smell of my hair.  Leaves your tresses soft even without a conditioner.  Give it a try; you'll love it

I'm a recent convert to Lush products and I have to say I'm thrilled to find this new shampoo. 

I started using this a couple of days ago and I've noticed a positive difference in my hair. My hair wasn't a total mess using silicone shampoos, but now that I've changed brands I can see the potential my hair had and I didn't even know it. 

I have shoulder length really thick hair with a few waves and curls. I don't have too much of a problem with tangling to begin with. All I needed was a couple of swipes down my hair and this will lather right up. It smells awesome in the shower. Lush describes it as oranges in a bowl of spices; I'm not so sure about that but it definately smells kind of foresty and nice. It rinsed off very well with hot water and I followed with Jungle conditioner. 

Hours later in the day I can stil smell Komba shampoo wafting around my head. It's amazing. I've never had a shampoo stick with me like this and my hair feels light and shiny and just clean. No matter how much I try to clean regular shampoo from my hair it seems to weigh it down. My boyfriend mentioned today my hair looked much less "poofy". This is just amazing. 

I would reccomend keeping the shampoo in an airtight container. Keeping it on a shelf where any water will hit it will deteriorate its longevity. I keep mine in a very tiny tupperwear container in the shower. The size of the bar is small, but it will go a loooooong way.

I am a new convert to LUSH products having stumbled upon them while at the Orlando airport. This is the first solid shampoo I have used and I really like this one. It lathers really nice and smells fantastic! It leaves my hair feeling full and shiny and better than any bottled shampoo I have ever used. My hair feels clean but not stripped and that is important since I color it. I am looking forward to trying the others and a conditioner as well. I am completely impressed with all the LUSH products I have tried and am looking forward to giving LUSH for Christmas

For a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is MAC. Lipglass feels good on your lips, as if it contained some emollients. And (this is a big AND) it's not tacky or sticky. 

The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. 

Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. 

Enjoy!

MAC LipGlass is the absolute best. There are plenty of colors to choose from, SUPER-Shiny, and the gloss is thick, stays on and doesn't run. 
The best colors are....
NICO for a cute lavender pink color with a glittery shine. 
OYSTERGIRL is a shimmery baby pink.
OH BABY is the perfect gloss for any earth toned lipstick.
CHAI looks amazing with black smokey eyes. It's the perfect neutral earthy gloss and has no glitter or shimmer - just pure shine

I'm REALLY anal about scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored with vanilla, but MAC LipGlass isn't that vanilla-ish at all!  It's got very pigmented color, it stays on a LONG time for a gloss, and each tube lasts a long time...  Don't let what the other reviewer said about the vanilla scent throw you off

I bought a Fantasy gift set (fragrance, body soufflÃ© &amp; jewellery box), and wasn't really interested in the soufflÃ©. I have sensitive skin &amp; suffer from migraines, so have to be careful about which products I use.

But curiosity got the better of me, so I gave it a try. The non-shimmering lotion melted into my skin immediately - no stinging or rashes.

 The FANTASY scent - chocolate, cupcake, lychee, quince and kiwi - is subtle enough not to overpower me, yet strong enough to have people comment on my wonderful fragrance. (The scent of the fruity ingredients seemed to last longer on me, but then again everybody is different).

The body soufflÃ© can be worn on it's own on subtler days, or layered with the fragrance for a longer lasting impression.

These are the replacement sponges for the Dermanew system. Each sponge includes a foam top section that comes in contact with your skin and a plastic bottom section that snaps securely on to your Dermanew applicator.

The sponges are very effective at applying the Dermanew dermabrasion creams. Very gentle on the skin with just the right amount of pressure. Each one also lasts a long time if you clean it after each use. But because of wear and tear and bacterial growth they should be replaced periodically.

The Dermanew system is great!(See my review on it) The sponges are excellent. However, I deducted one star because I feel $4.00 is pricey for the item.

I went to Sephora looking for a high quality bubble bath and the associate recommended Deep Steep and promised "movie star bubbles."  She was right!  I went back to get more (several months later), and Sephora no longer carries this brand.  Luckilly, I found it here.  The bubbles and the fragrance are long lasting, with no harsh chemicals or greasy residue left in the bathtub.  The fragrance is nice but not overhwelming.  The bubbles are full and lasting...they won't end up in a mound at your feet.  Somehow, they're distributed all throughout the bath water...just waiting for you to slide in!
You don't need to use a lot of bubblebath, which is good..because of the  price....but even with a small amount, you'll have a tub full of bubbles!!!  Enjoy!!

Perfect for touch-ups throughout the party season!

The best selling fragrance; the sweetness of chocolate and cupcake, before settling with fruity scents of lychee, quince and kiwi. The base note of vanilla lingers throughout making FANTASY a truly delicious classic in the making!

The gloss; Despite its greenish colour it is clear &amp; shimmery!!

Never mind the party season - this is a handbag must have all year round!!!

I'm 36 ,light normal/oily skin, freckles due to past sun damage . I've tried many other products (Neutrogena copper serum, did nothing, olay, did nothing, l'oreal, nothing or takes a lot of weeks and money to start working)so I decided to give this serum a try and I loved it! I've been using it for a year, every night and my skin has changed a lot,it looks fresh,healthier of course you have to have a routine :clean,exfoliate and moisture, but it's worth every penny! I highly recommended it

I started using Face Oasis when H2O Plus first opened its stores.  There are two specific reasons why I continue to use it.  I am sensitive to most cosmetic product smells and perfumes - it has its own unique "light" smell, but it certainly does not make my eyes water - and its ability to be absorbed by the skin without leaving a residue, or greasy feeling. Some skin products (some very expensive ones)have left my face dried out even though labeled as "moisturizers". Face Oasis has this wonderful 'cool' feeling to it.  A $34.00 jar lasts 3 months - do the math.  Some over the counter skin products cost over $9.00 and Face Oasis and H2O Plus products on the whole, are fiscally sound purchases for those looking for a bargain

 I have dry skin, this moisturizer worked so well when I used it in my 20s, I felt my skin being hydrated instantly after putting it on my face. However, after i reached 30s, it's no longer good enough for my skin. If you have very oily skin (or outer oily, inner dry), it would be a very good moisturizer for you.

I have another Fekkai product, and loved it so much I wanted to take a look at what else dear Frederic had to offer.  I've always wanted a product that would put waves in my hair, but every one I tried before just made my hair stiff, crunchy, and icky looking!  I read good reviews about this product, so I decided to give it a try.  It amazed me!  My hair really doesn't have much natural wave- maybe one or two semi-waves in the back.  Frankly, if I leave my hair air-dry without doing anything to it, it looks like cave-woman hair!  But not with this stuff!  I towel dried my hair until it was just damp.  Then I sprayed it all over my hair, flipped my head over and scrunched. (If your hair tends to get frizzy, you may want to add a little cream- such as Fekkai glossing cream- as this product doesn't do much to combat frizz)  Then I blow-dryed on low for just a minute or two while scrunching, and let the rest air-dry.  I have a few pieces of hair in the front that is quite damaged from coloring, and the waves weren't that defined there.  But the rest of my hair- wow!  I never imagined having such fun waves with my relatively straight hair!  Frederic Fekkai is a genius!

This liner is thin as advertised, goes on easy, stays, and is really nice stuff.  Be warned, though, the lightest shade is REALLY light, and only good if you're REALLY pale.  It barely shows on me - I'm really pale with strawberry blonde hair and even I should've gone darker on the color.  Recommended

It is amazing! I didn't believe it at first until my friend showed me how to use it. I cannot believe how it stays on all day. Completely accentuates and lengthens my lashes. I curled them first and then applied Fiberwig, my lashes were up the entire day, they never came down. Probably because of how light it is, it is not heavy at all. My lashes look totally natural...and the best part...when I washed it off at the end of the night, it was sooooo easy to remove! It never smudged...not during the day or even after I washed them off. I absolutely love it

I'm on my second day of using this mascara and I think it's love. I wear contacts and this stuff doesn't irritate my eyes at all! My lashes look so much longer and thicker and it doesn't flake or smudge. Plus, it comes off easily with my makeup towelette at night.

Word to the natural girls - this is not a mascara for you my nuetral, peach gloss loving friend. This is pumped-up, girly-girl, make-up faced stuff. If you're in the mood for a little drama, try it. You'll love it

I got it, and I love it. Simple as that. I was a little suprised that there wasn't much lather, but it does get my very thick hair clean. Upon further thought I took to reading the ingredients again, and it's mostly all natural stuff. Kinda makes on wonder what is in the Rx bought stuff???
Try it, yes, it fragrant but I like it. However, it could be overpowering for some,especially if you are over sensitive to sents

When I first tried this bar, my hair did feel very conditioned, but I didn't realize it was a 2 in 1 bar, so I used American Cream conditioner too. They do work very well together, but you can probably get away with just the shampoo bar. I was amazed at how much fun it was to use the shampoo bars, except you do have to keep them out of the shower or in a shampoo bar tin. 

If you are in love with the Flying Fox shower gel and temple balm, this may be the one you want. The ingredient list is impressive: Hibiscus Extreact, Shea Butter, Camellia Oil, Jojoba Oil, Macadamia Nut Oil, Coconut Butter, Jasmine, Ylang Ylang Oil, Cypress Oil, Palmarosa Oil and even a few little jasmine flowers just for fun. I loved this bar almost as much as Trichomania, also with coconut. 

I'm wondering if having hard water makes a difference when using the shampoo bars. I bought a shower filter and haven't noticed any problems with anything I've tried so far.

I travel a lot, and yes I only take one carry-on bag, with the new restrictions I tried this shampoo, I have a LOT of Hair, it's colored and is veeeerrrryyy  choosy about shampoos, so is my scalp (overly sensitive and does itch if I use the wrong product) ..... so I always travel with my own bottle never trusting the hotels tiny punny bottle, 

I was a little skeptical since it's not really that big (smaller than a regular bar of soap) I have been using it a week, my hair is manageble, no tangles, and oh so shinny , soft and NO itchy scalp !!!  I wet my hair wet the bar and 4 nice big circles over my shoulder lenght hair and taddaaa  suds, and yes I agree the smell is a little overpowering but hey, I can't take my perfume with me, the soft aroma that lingers in my hair will have to do...

I was skeptical at first.  I mean, a shampoo/conditioner bar?  I haven't been super impressed with Lush's other solid shampoos or conditioners (at least, not enough to write a review, good or bad), so I was doubtful about this 2-in-1 bar.  But I loved the idea, and I was curious, so I bought it and I must say that Godiva far surpassed my hopes!

My hair is about shoulder length, and it only took about 6 or 7 good swipes on wet hair to work up an incredible lather! (3 or 4 swipes wasn't enough, and 10 was too much!)

My hair felt clean, but not that styrofoam-squeaky clean where *everything* is stripped from your hair.  And the conditioner is light, but doesn't really kick in until your hair dries.  I don't personnally recommend using a hair dryer, so I don't know how that would affect the conditioner, but air drying has worked great for me.

I also recommend it for travel since it's about the size of your palm, is 2-in-1, and won't leak!  

(The only warning I'd give is for the shampoo tin.  I got it for free, so maybe I shouldn't complain, but... let the shampoo bar dry before putting it into the tin!!!  It is a PAIN to get it out if you don't.)

I also LOVE the scent, but could be too strong for some people (or not strong enough).  Everyone is different, but if you don't live near a Lush store, you'll never know until you buy it!  :

After years of relying on other people's opinions about products, Godiva is the one that finally inspired me to write.  If your idea of heaven is rocking on a sunny veranda with a glass of iced tea in one hand and a good book in the other, a ceiling fan spinning overhead and the heady scent of jasmine filling the air...you will love this product.

Not only does Godiva leave my hair smelling wonderful, it also leaves it shiny and full of body.  Because my hair is very long, I do use some conditioner on the ends of my hair.

Godiva is paradise in a bar...and it's much less expensive than a trip to the islands

I've been using this shampoo/conditioner in one for a month or so now.  I have color-treated otherwise normal hair that is wavy and prone to frizz.  This bar is great because it lasts FOREVER - as i said, I've owned it for a month but it still looks brand new!  A little bit goes a long way...I lather my hands with it (as if I was washing my hands) then distribute evenly throughout my hair.  Lots of lather!!!

The smell is amazing: jasmine mixed with ylang-ylang.  I wouldn't recommend this product to those who don't like strong-smelling products, or to those who don't like essential oil type scents (you know who you are). 

I feel as this shampoo (along with all lush hair products) results in hair that dries quicker.  I reccommend that you blow-dry shortly after washing if you don't drip dry.  

As far as a all in one product, I still use a seperate conditioner - but that's just me, and that goes for all brands.

This rejuvenates hair, and makes it SHINY!!

I've been using this product for years.  Every now and then I try another product in hopes of finding something a little cheaper.  I have NEVER found anything that comes close to this one.  
I'm over forty, but still have somewhat oily skin, and get breakouts on occasion.  IF I use this two to three times per week, I definitely notice that I have fewer breakouts.  My skin is smoother and more even.
I like the menthol feel.  I don't smell it at all, and find it refreshing.  I've also tried the 7-day scrub and don't find it to come close to this product.  The grains in the 7-day scrub are few and far between.  With the exfoiliating scrub, they are very concentrated.  Too much?  Just add a little water.
I only hope that Clinique doesn't stop making this

I don't know why so many reviews say they get six or seven shaves. Aren't you using hot shaving soap? I have an average European beard. I shave in the shower each day with mug soap and a bristle brush.  That is the key.  I get a good hot lather going. The lather is just to keep your whiskers wet and soft. Using a Merkur blade, I get well over fifteen or twenty shaves....or more. I don't really keep count, but one blade lasts me at least four weeks, and I shave daily. I reluctantly change blades when it seems it is a bit dull..But I think I could use it much longer...Honest. I can't imagine spending three dollars for a multiblade razor good for seven days.  Love my Merkur razor, too

This is the first double edge blade I used in my Merkur safety razor &amp; for me they work alot better than the other ones mentioned above.
I usually get 5 to 7 days per one blade. I have found that the Feather brand DE blades to be the sharpest of all I have tried but they do not seem to last as long

I was timid to use my Merkur razor for the first time, and was very careful around my neck. A week or so after starting I feel like a pro. These razors are very sharp and keep their edge for at least six or seven shaves. It truly doesn't even feel like I'm shaving, the cut is so effortless

If you let your beard grow a few days between cuttings like I do you need to use these blades.  They will cut through heavy hair with one or two passes.  They will not nick or cut if you are careful.  Then I use my regular razor with the 5 blades in it, I think it's called the fusion, and I don't have to shave for 3 days and my face stays hair free

I stumbled upon this shower gel collection this past Christmas season. I knew right away this would be a perfect solution for a lot of holiday gifts on my list. I was pleased that I could knock off a number of ladies off of my list with one purchase. I was even happier with the free shipping and $30 Amazon gift card offer they had going on at the time. 

I couldn't wait for the package to arrive. I ripped into it as soon as it got to me. The gels were all packed nicely in a sturdy box with handle from Philosophy. I had to restrain myself from keeping all of the gels. I managed to give away nine of them after some agonizing deliberation. (The mint chocolate chip, lemon custard, and berry ones were mine.) Plus the cool box made a perfect container for all of my other gels that I rotate according to season.

I'm a big fan of most of Philosophy's products. They have some awesome smelling shower gels as well as wonderfully working skincare products. I was already familar with the excellent cinnamon buns and double cocoa scents so I figured most of these should be pretty darn good too. The mint chocolate chip is nice but the lemon custard is weaker smelling out of the bottle. As with all of their 3-in-1s,Oh well, some will be a hit where as others will miss.

As with all of their 3-in-1s, the shower gel makes mounds of lather, cleans your skin usually without drying, and works fairly well as a shampoo too - though conditioner is typically needed. I like the shower gels a lot. I know my gal pals enjoyed their Christmas gift too. All things considered, this was a fantastic deal!

The fragrances are marvelous, yet after the shower they do not interfere with your scent of choice. I find the shower gel is very creamy and not drying at all. I do use it as well as a shampoo, but have found in the dry harsh winter I still need a conditioner. I highly recommend this product

This little tool really does help.  It gets blackheads out especially well.  The lancet is O.K., but not as sharp as it could be.  Still, be careful with it!  You're still poking your face!  

Another note: Tweezerman is a good company to buy from- very socially and environmentally responsible.  The company thats sells it through Amazon is good, too.  Prompt, and includes little candies in the box

Okay, so 80 bucks seems like a lot of money to plunk down for an at-home microdermabrasion kit...especially when everyone from Homedics to L 'Oreal is marketing a more cost-friendly version of what appears to be the same EXACT thing.  However, experience (and lots of money not-so-well spent) has taught me that, in most cases, you generally get what you pay for.  Case in point: a few months ago I finally made the decision to trade in my 99 cent ultra-black mascara for a high-end name brand version of the same product...I immediately discovered that mascara-induced racoon eyes really can be avoided!  Who knew?  After that, I vowed never to pinch pennies when it comes to beauty.  Now there are, of course, some exceptions; my mother swears by Oil of Olay -as do I- but when you're talking about microderabrasion, a proceedure that can cost as much as $150 per session, it's hard to believe that you can achieve the same exact results with something that is a mere fraction of the cost.

Skeptical but desperate for youthful looking skin, I opted to splurge on the DermaNew Facial Rejuvenation System.  Prior to my purchase, I did a fair amount of research so I knew that what I was getting the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of the more than twenty-plus versions that I had to choose from.  

Just two weeks after using it, I began to notice that my once sallow complexion (thanks to stress, lack of sleep and yo-yo dieting) had been replaced with a healthy glow.  Now my skin looks soft and peachy, kind of like it did when I was twelve...you know, when youth and beauty was effortless...sigh!  

All in all this product is best for someone with little to no skin flaws.  Those who are expecting miracle results or results similar to what you would get from a full-service salon treatment may be dissapointed.  My advice, shell out the necessary funds in order to get your skin under control, then use this product for the upkeep.  This is great for removing the dead skin that regular washing tends to leave behind.

At first I was hesitant to ante up the $ to purchase the dermanew system, but after a few friends raved about it, I decided to buy it.

The system includes a battery operated applicator tool (batteries are included), sponge tops for the tool, and dermabrasion cream.

You pop a sponge on top of the applicator, put cream on it and apply to your dampened skin. I set a timer for 3 minutes and work the applicator around the surface of my skin. 

The results are great! Dead skin is sloughed off, circulation is stimulated and the results are glowing soft skin.
My skin looks lovely and feels smooth to the touch. It felt soft and wonderful after the very first application!

Dermanew sells other applicator sponges and creams separately to use with the applicator tool on your hands and feet.

Though the initial price tag seems high, this tool will last for years and help you to glowing skin! I highly recommend it

The entire line is fabulous, but the rose zircon lip gloss is by far the best. I have never been one to wear lipstick, but since I first tried this lip plumping gloss, I rearly leave home without it.  It doesn't feel like you are wearing anything, yet it stays on while eating and drinking. The rose zircon matches my lips and that of all my friends who have borrowed it and not returned it because they love it so. It just makes me feel glamorous

I started with a regular hair towel by Aquis, then received the turban as a gift.  Both are great, but the turban stays on better, as it can twist to fasten at the nape of the neck.  The products are super-absorbant and make blow-drying much faster.  I've tried the generic brand, but it can't compare to this.  I use it after every shower.  A must-have

The emotionally healing benefits of orange oil and lavender become immediately apparent when you apply this to your scalp. If you can find someone to give you a head massage with this product, then you can truly relax. If applying this yourself, it works well as an at home hair treatment to nourish the hair follicles and promote healthy hair growth. You will also notice your hair becoming stronger and retaining a much deeper shine. The essential oils in this product help to activate micro-circulation which may cause a slight tingling and warming of the scalp. Leave this in for about 5-10 minutes and then wash your hair as normal. You may find you need less conditioner when using this product. Many hairdressers will use this product when giving a conditioning head massage and that is where I first found out about this product. I bought my first bottle the day I had the massage. I was that impressed and I keep buying this product.

I LOVE this foundation. I have Warm Sand Moisture Rich Foundation. It is incredibly smooth, long wearing and the color makes my skin look bright and radiant. Bobbi Brown makes very natural foundation colors and there is a range of colors for all different skin tones. When I'm shopping it seems that most lines cater to lighter and medium skin tones, but Bobbi Brown really does come through with flattering options for all skin tones. The only draw back is that this foundation does not provide adequate SPF protection, even though it says SPF 15. Therefore, you will still need to wear a sunscreen underneath of at least SPF 15. I use this foundation every day and I wear sunscreen from Paula's Choice (which I love). I think that the color options available, the long lasting color and the smooth texture make this foundation worth the price.

I have used this product for the past 16 years. It is wonderful!The Super Double Face Powder is actually a foundation and matte powder all rolled into one product. The product comes with an application sponge, goes on dry, gives superb coverage! I don't even use my Clinique concelar when I wear this product, it is that good! This product works best with those individuals who have normal or combination skin.

The smell is the only caveat for me, it's a little bit sour/bitter/funky smelling. Another thing that I find strange is I have to use alot of this to feel like I've saturated my skin. I go through it pretty quickly compared to other spray type toners. The whole Hauschka regimen is so amazing for my skin. To use, spritz on after cleansing and press gently into the skin

I was skeptical at first.  The only beer I ever drink is pale and icy on a hot, HOT day.  But my skin is terribly sensitive and 99% of shampoos make my scalp scream and my face blotchy.  So I was willing to try anything, especially from LUSH, because all of their products are of such high quality.  Last time I visited their shop, I bought the 8 oz bottle of this because it didn't have anything that I knew I was allergic to in it.

Over three months later now, and I'm still using it.  I've even come to like the smell.  And I only have to use a scalp treatment shampoo (Nizoral or Meted, which are great for the scalp but hard on the hair) maybe once a week for maintenence.  I can wear black and not have to shake my shirt off every 10 minutes.  There are no painful lesions hiding under my hair.  And the couple of people who have noticed the scent have enjoyed it and had a good chuckle when I told them what it was.

Thank you, LUSH

The scent of Cynthia Sylvia Stout shampoo is fabulous, sticks with you, and the shampoo also is great.  The price is steep, yes, but worth it.  Don't bother with the 3.3 oz "trial size" because you'll most likely only waste shipping charges and go on to order the bigger bottles next time

...but I didn't care for the smell.  It does smell like beer and I could smell it throughout the day after I used it (smell fades throughout the day), but I guess if you like the smell of this shampoo, then it won't be a problem at all.  Did notice my hair was shinier and softer(which is hard to say for my hair), but had to knock off a star for the scent.  

Cynthia Sylvia Stout Shampoo was just `okay' and I will be sticking with Rehab, Big, and I Love Juicy (see my reviews).  Try a smaller size bottle first, and remember that some of the products IN the LUSH store smells different when you get them home

As I stated in my other reviews, I have color-treated otherwise normal hair which is wavy and prone to frizz.  I like this shampoo for it's calming effect, best experienced after a couple of uses.  If you straighten your hair, this will work great because the shine and smoothness will be most noticable.

To those of you worried that your boss may think you spent your lunch break in a pub - the stout scent fades quick and is only really identifyable while washing.  

A word to the wise, this shampoo is a bit drying.  I make sure to deep condition at least once a week to avoid crispy hair.

I purchased this cleanser about 3 weeks ago. I saw a dramatic difference in my oily, acne-prone skin after a day or 2. It works well if you remove your makeup first with a cleanser and then use it. It has really refined my skin and made it more smooth and I've had much less breakouts. I am very happy with this product and plan to repurchase again. It works well with the oily skin solution too! A great product

This is a great product to enhanse and define curls. It's work perfectly with very curly hair without any stifness. The only reason i don't give it five stars is because if you have long hair and want to define your curls but hav some volume as well, this mousse as a tendancy to reduce the volume of very long hair. So great for curls, but without volumizing effect. The price too is kind of expensive. This product is cheaper in france: around 18-24 Euros. It is worth the price though and Kerastase products are seen as the best in Europe

       There's something about Armani!  His fragrances are as stylish and classic as his designs.  Acqua Di Gio is a case in point with its virile, mysterious, intriguing scent.  It's fresh and at the same time sensual.

	Notes include Calabrian bergamot, neroli, and the zest of green tangerine, each warming and giving vitality to the fragrance.

	Mr. Armani has said that the inspiration for this scent came from the shoreline of Pantelleria island, a body of land which lies in the Mediterranean Sea between Sicily and Tunisia.   Pantelleria is one of a kind, a rarity as is Acqua Di Gio.

I bought this and several other Philosphy 3-in-1 products totally based on their yummy smell, and this is probably my favorite!  It truly smells like a melting strawberry milkshake made with fresh strawberries and whole milk ice cream.  I never get tired of the smell!  

I will admit I have only used this as body wash, not as shampoo or conditioner.  I have found that combination products do not work well on my dry curly hair, so I cannot attest to the hair cleaning properties of this product.  I can say that I've been using Philosphy products on my skin for about a year, and I love them.  I have found that my skin has been slightly less dry since I switched from my old product.

I (and I've heard many others say this same thing) have found that the fragrance does not linger strongly on your skin after your shower.  My husband never smells my flavor du jour on my skin after my shower, and I am glad, because I don't think strawberries and Clinique Happy go well together.  So if you are concerned about smelling like you stepped out of Dairy Queen, don't

It has the perfect consistency - rich, but not greasy.  It leaves my skin looking dewy.  Makeup glides on over it, and the nice rose smell is an added bonus.

Try this cream on your neck and chest (the areas that often get neglected-- once you get wrinkle or sagging on your neck, you can't do anything to hide your age!!!).   I was surprised to see an immediate difference in appearance of neck and chest, giving it a smooth glow.  My mom tried it on her neck and before she even told me I thought her neck looked smoother.  This cream is too creamy for my combo face which tends to get oily throughout the day.

I am by no means any kind of expert on the in's and out's of quality cologne.  I do however know what works for my chemistry and what works for the ladies.  When I first smelled Touch, I thought, "Not bad, and an attractive bottle."  The initial spray did not grab me, however with the dry down....it was wonderful.  I actually had a young lady at my job physically stop me in the hall, sniff my neck, and look at me with longing eyes and ask what I was wearing!  At that point, I knew that Touch was going to be part of my "smell good" arsenal

Let me first start of by saying I love 'Touch' by Burberry, I wear it more than I wear any other cologne I own. It is very versatile and  not too strong in its fragrance. However, the scent doesn't last very long and you may have to spray a few more times than usual to achieve results that will last to your hoping.

'Touch' is the first cologne Burberry has designed that leans towards a "sour" smell but in this case, it works. 'Touch' is very romantic, elegant, provocative, and sensational all at once...but its effects are only minimal. Maybe if it were redesigned to produce long-lasting results then I would probably add the 5th star to this rating but unfortunately, the scene span of 'Touch' can only leave me wishing.

"Touch" is one of 10 kinds of colognes in my collection and it's the best, hands down.  It's that kind of scent that you can wear to any occasion (formal, night out on the town) with any kind of clothing (suit, casual).  I get a lot of comments from the ladies, too

So glad I was able to find the Estee Lauder Equalizer Smart Loose Powder on this website... Thank You, Thank You, Thank You!
All the stores I've been to have discontinued it and it's the best stuff around for me. All I have to do after applying my moisturizer is use a little concealer where necessary, use this powder &amp; I'm Done!  No more foundations, nothing!  The color 03
Medium gives me a little color, smooths my pores making my face look soft and radiant. I ordered three just in case Estee Lauder's really going to do away with this powder (their so-called "replacement" in the stores "Lucidity Loose Powder" in the supposed same color 03 Medium is nasty stuff!  It smells yucky, it's cakey, and the color is not even close!!!)  I'm going to order at least 3 more (even at $25 a piece it's well worth it.

this is a review on the new makeup called souffle. i like it. it feels like nothing. the only thing it needs is a paddle to get it out of the jar so as not to contaminate it before its gone. it is an swesome makeup and worked well for me. a good value for your money and the best part it feels like nothing on your face but makes it look fresh and not caked on. a wonderful product and great value. i will buy it again. since it did not come with a paddle for use i used a plastic knife to get it out of the jar without getting it contaminated. makeup does sour. so better to be safe than sorry. good job avo

The powdery scent of fresh flowers and musk; Chanel # 19 is sex personified. I could spend an entire evening in a pair of Italian heels and this fragrance alone. A matter of fact I did. 

When I smell Chanel # 19 I think of cold winter nights wrapped up in cashmere laying on a leather chaise with the heat of a warm fire bath me. Chanel #19 evokes the glorious feel of crisp winters and elegant evenings. A subtle fragrance that becomes more powerful with the heat of your body so it's best in the winter or very special occasions.

I highly recommend Chanel # 19 if you need a lift in mood this winter. One whiff and your mood will be elevated, I promise. Even the sight of the perfume is wonderful. A beautiful classic glass Chanel bottle' the delicate liquid beckons you to put it on and enjoy. Just the feel of the bottle in your hand is glorious.

Evoke your sense of smell, sight, and touch with Chanel # 19.

girldiver:)
Thank You Jim Pfrommer for the gift.

This is the best foundation for my skin. I have rather fair, sensitive skin, and have been searching for the "perfect" foundation for years. I have found it in this product which is lightweight and silky. My skin feels so soft and delicate and looks great with this product on. It provides excellent coverage and stays on for hours; it goes on remarkably well and blends just as easily.

I really like this cleanser. I have tried many different brands; both high-end and over the counter, and this one really does exactly what it should. It cleanses my skin without drying and actually makes it feel moisturized without feeling weighed down. I tend toward dry, flaky, sensitive skin on my face and this is just a great cleanser for my problem skin. You just need to make sure that this product is fresh and doesn't sit past it's shelf life because it does contain shea butter and will go bad after it's expiration or if exposed to sunlight/heat.

For a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is MAC. Lipglass feels good on your lips, as if it contained some emollients. And (this is a big AND) it's not tacky or sticky. 

The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. 

Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. 

Enjoy!

MAC LipGlass is the absolute best. There are plenty of colors to choose from, SUPER-Shiny, and the gloss is thick, stays on and doesn't run. 
The best colors are....
NICO for a cute lavender pink color with a glittery shine. 
OYSTERGIRL is a shimmery baby pink.
OH BABY is the perfect gloss for any earth toned lipstick.
CHAI looks amazing with black smokey eyes. It's the perfect neutral earthy gloss and has no glitter or shimmer - just pure shine

I'm REALLY anal about scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored with vanilla, but MAC LipGlass isn't that vanilla-ish at all!  It's got very pigmented color, it stays on a LONG time for a gloss, and each tube lasts a long time...  Don't let what the other reviewer said about the vanilla scent throw you off

Finally, women everywhere can have the same effects of a facelift without the expense or the pain! This sumptuous cream from Clarins will help avoid that "rugged" look on the neck as soon as it starts to become evident; thus making you look younger because, once the signs of aging start to appear on the neck, they reflect on a woman's appearance as a whole.  You will notice a difference in the tightness of the skin of your neck right after the first application.  Subsequent ones will just make a good thing even better.

Clarins has been a leader in beauty products for years now and they have been my favorite brand since I discovered them in my early twenties. Their line is extensive in very specific treatments (such as body and bust oils, etc.); so much much so, that I've never seen a neck cream from any of the other prestigious skin care brands - such as Shiseido and Guerlain for instance. I use most of their products but this one, I truly love. Highly reccommended

I have recently became a Clinique lover. I was a little worried about buying at the full price before either testing it in stores or getting it somewhere cheaper in case the color was wretched. I got my tube from Ebay for a little less than retail. When it came in the mail the color was just gorgeous. Surprise is actually a bronze shimmer color, almost a sparkle metallic. The color is so rich on my lips but doesn't look overdone. It feels light and stays with me which is a plus. Before wasting your money on colors that you will use once or twice, why not splurge a little for something you're sure to love a lot? In the end it's not a splurge really because you're sure to use use use and come back for more!

My wife casually mentioned that she really liked this new Hypnose perfume she smelled in a magazine advertisement.  Hint! Hint! Hint!  So, I bought it for her, of course.  I like the smell - to me it has a hint of citrusy, flowery, vanilla aroma.  And it's a lighter, not cloying perfume, which I prefer.  I would definitely give this perfume a thumbs up

In the search for a signature scent- I've found my bliss. I first smelled this perfume in my Lucky magazine. Just rubbing the paper on my wrist, I was transported. Of course you can't tell how a perfume will work with your chemistry until you've tried it for at least a week. I picked up a sample in a department store and each time I wore Hypnose I was hypnotized again. The name is very appropriate. 

It's a feminine scent that is fresh, and actually induces a soothing and happy mood. The notes are vanilla absolut, passionflower, and vetiver. It's joyfully calming. 

Also, it's not overwhelming. Others will have to stand very close to you in order to smell it.

I have tried every product out there and have spent thousands of dollars for my dark under eye circles and puffiness.
This is by far the best I have tried.  The under eye circles look much better and I don't look horrible anymore in the morning.  Please try it, it works.  Would love to hear what everyone else thinks

While it seems these days that most shampoos have a specific purpose (ie- volumizing, de-frizzing, curl-enhancing, color-protecting, etc.) this one is an amazing all-around shampoo, wonderful for daily use for all types, colors and styles of hair. The smell is incredible - truly invigorating to wake up to in the morning shower. It doesn't leave any buildup or residue as many shampoos often do, so you don't have to worry about switching your shampoo every few weeks. Its a great classic which I hope stays around forever- I'll remain a loyal fan!

Good stuff!  A little pricey, though.  Great for summer - makes you feel cool and tingly all over - even makes me get goosebumps sometimes!  The cooling effects even last for a little while after you get out of the shower!  Very concentrated so you don't need a lot of it, and it doesn't run all over the place like some other body washes do.  Even my husband likes it!  Would be nice if it were a little more moisturizing, though.  If not for that and the price, I would have given this a 5 star review.

During a recent stay at the W Hotel in New York City, I thoughtlessly used the complimentary toiletries, which happened to be Blisslabs products.  I was so impressed that the same day I went on a major shopping spree to Bliss's in-hotel boutique and I haven't used anything else since. I love their products and cannot recommend them highly enough. Their Shock Therapy is my favorite product. If you don't like the smell of peppermint, this is not the body wash for you, but if you do, this will become your new morning ritual. The smell of mint is very, very strong, and refreshing, truly helping to clear out the early-morning cobwebs. The shower gel is clear and smooth, not grainy. It washes off cleanly and is SO refreshing. It's a great change from the ultrafeminine floral/fruity scents out there. There's a 16-ounce size out there for $32.00--almost twice the size for an extra $9. You can't go wrong. You'll love this stuff.

I don't like liquid eye shadows because they seem to wear off but this
stayed on all night and all the colors are pretty It also worked great as a liner under my bottom eyelashes. I don't care for the wand it's to goopy I used a eyeliner brush to apply. Also A little goes a long way

One of the few moisturizing products I have used that doesnt't make me

One pump is enough for problem areas -around my mouth, between brows, forehead.
Absorbs quickly, lasts all day. Skin looks healthier, wrinkles less noticeable

This stuff goes on easy, stays well (but WILL rub off with water, won't withstand a good cry).  Nice.  Not quite as nice as the Victoria's Secret liner (I swear by that stuff, discontinued 3-4 years ago), but WAY better than anything cheaper.  I have TRIED other things.  Plus, won't irritate my very sensitive eyes

This is a great little lip gloss collection - all of the LOLA lip gloss colors in mini bottles. While kind of pricey, I love it since I can never make up my mind and would have a hard time shelling out $16 for something I might not wear. I love these glosses, they're light, tasteless-to-slightly-minty, long-lasting and relatively non-sticky (as far as glosses go - I'm a very low-makeup girl, so the fact that I can wear these without getting my hair glued to my lips is a big plus!) One caveat: this is a sampler - these are TINY bottles (each roughly the size of my pinkie), but that can be a bonus if you want something to slip in the smallest pocket or purse. I've now bought two of my favorites (celestial and rush) in the full-size version for daily wear, which lets me save the mini versions for days I need something tiny, and the rest aren't colors I'll wear every day, but I love the option when I want something different.

The Lola Gloss Menagerie is all a girl could ask for in a small, cute gloss. The colors are perfect for layering, and each cute tube lasts quite a while longer than I would have expected. The refreshingly light peppermint taste is very pleasant, and is not overpowering at all. Although it has a hefty price tag, the Menagerie is very much worth it. These make cute gifts as well, and almost every girl will love the convinient sizing, as well as the super shine it emits. It's not sticky at all. I love it

I usually wear the socks with the cream for 2 to 3 hours. I've had them since Christmas and have used them twice a week and after only 4 treatments (using the softening sock salve), my heels are SO much smoother and softer! I had really deep cracks in my heels with sharp chunks poking out - even using a heel file didn't help! But these things are already showing drastic improvement!  The only part that's hard for me is soaking my feet first, so I usually do it in the morning after my shower.  {Another nice benefit of being a stay at home mom ;-)}

My box lists step by step instructions including how to hand wash them. After 4 uses (2-3 hours as stated previously) I feel no need to wash these - my feet do NOT sweat in them.  I've even worn a pair of slipper socks over them to help keep them clean when I walked around the house (careful with that one - they're pretty slick when you first put them on with the softening sock salve!) and my feet still didn't sweat.

I DO recommend using the softening sock salve with them for faster results. 

I hope everyone is as happy with these as I am

I first tried Tend Skin from an article in a beauty magazine. I first bought it from Sephora, and the worker there told me it does hurt when you put it on..but it's worth it. I do agree that it does sting when you put it on after shaving, but it's the only thing that has stopped my sensitive skin from breaking out in rashes or bumps.  As far as preventing in-grown hairs, it does help. It doesn't prevent them totally, but with a combination of exfoliating and using Tend Skin, I've found that it works pretty well

I received a smaple size of this face creme with my recent order of my hunny's anniversary present from Estee Lauder. It came with a bunch of other stuff that I either swapped or gave away, but this was a real winner for me. It came as a 5-day supply, and I just wish I had more. 

I used this creme as a supplement to other lotions I wasn't thrilled with, namely, Neutrogena Whip Moisturizer with SPF 15 or 30, and Clinique Super City Block SPF 40(but I'm still undecided about this one). Both of these weren't smooth enough. they didn't have that nice slip to spread easily across the skin. The former I had to use a lot of on its owen to really moisturize the lower half of my face, and the latter I had to rub very hard in order to get it to spread without this creme. 

I love that this creme gets the job done. Out of all the moisturizers I have used for my face, I have had to use this one the most sparingly in order to moisturize, and I like that. I can imagine it coests more than the other two moisturizers, but it also does a better job. 

I don't like that when I first put it on, it seems to warm up my face a bit around the nose and mouth. Ordinarily this wouldn't bother me, but seeing as to how almost every other thing has been breaking me out recently, it makes me a teensy bit paranoid. Howver, this sensation does not persist, so I don't worry too much about it. The other thing is that it takes alittle longer to sink into the skin, and until it does, it gives my skin the look as if I have been sweating, but then it's in and my skin just feels good. 

Isn't that what moisture is all about?

I'm usually a drugstore mascara girl--my current fave is Maybelline's Full and Soft--but I had the opportunity to pick this up cheap, so I decided to try it. Immediately, I liked the thinner-sized tube (can't stand those overly fat mascaras!) and the stiff-bristled brush. The product is a bit on the dry side, but I much prefer that to wet and gloppy. There wasn't too much product on the brush, and it was easy to apply. I definitely noticed a lengthening effect beyond what I've seen with any other mascara, which was great because it made my small eyes look much more open. Also, the product stayed put all day long, absolutely no smudging or flaking. My only slight disappointment was that it left my lashes looking a bit thin, as the effect is long and spidery; I guess I'm used to the fullness I get from my everyday mascara, Full and Soft.  I will continue to use Definicils for times when I particularly want more length, and I've found that I can layer it with my Full and Soft to get both the length and fullness I want.  I would repurchase this if I could get it for a discount again, but I would not pay full price

OK, this is a true story. I was in the gym last week, and I went into the locker room to wash my hands after my workout. I opened the door and was immediately startled by an amazing scent -- unlike anything I had encountered before. Someone's perfume? I wondered. But it was so different! I wondered whether the person was still in the locker room. I was at the sink when I saw someone walking around by the back wall. I couldn't help myself from what happened next, even though I knew I would sound like a freak: "Is that your perfume I smell?" I asked her. "Yes," she replied pensively, probably thinking I was going to complain about someone using perfume in the locker room. "WHAT IS IT?? It's the most wonderful thing I have ever smelled," I said. "Burberry Weekend," she replied, as her face melted into the the confident, self-satisfactory smile of a woman who knows she has something another woman wants. 

I excitedly told my husband what happened that day, and I am hoping he will buy me some of this incredible fragrance for Christmas.

These are great candles and make great gifts because they are packed so nice.

The candles burn evenly and nice and slowly.  The scents are great!  Natural smelling and strong enough but not overwhelming in any way.  I can burn one of these on my first level and scent the whole floor unlike most other candles where I need to burn multiple candles to get the same level of scent...

So yes, they are more expensive than candles you can get but when I burn this one, its the only one I need to burn at a time...  with cheaper candles I dont really end up savings because I am burning several at once.

Ordered two of these candles as gifts (Red Current &amp; Moroccan Fig).  They come carefully packaged in a nice box, and the candle is in a clear glass voltive.  Red Current is a more perfumey scent with an undertone of fruit, while the Fig is sort of sweet-earthy.  A good housewarming/hostess gift

This summer I have been using Neutrogena's tanning mousse in medium.  Allure gave the Neutrogena product a great review.  I like it because like this product, it gives an instant color while also including the chemical that develops a tan over the hours.  However, I have been having to bleach my bath towels to get out the leftover mousse on my legs after I get out of the shower at night (If I don't it gets on my sheets.)  Also, you have to work quickly with your hands to spread the mousse before it streaks. Then you have to clean it from your fingernails.

I tried this Modelco spray at Sephora today.  It goes on very evenly, no hand blending needed.  It is lighter than the medium Neutrogena, which is great bec I am very fair skinned.  Much easier to apply, but costs a lot more.  I'll prob use it on weekends because you can spray all those hard to reach areas.  During the week when I'm just doing my legs I'll  stick to the cheaper Neutrogena product.

I don't know what I would do without this mascara!!  This mascara is to me beyond the best that I have ever used, (and I have had my share of investments in other brands of mascara only to be sadly disappointed).  I would give this product 10 stars if Amazon would let me.  I have to confess that I carry this mascara with me everywhere (not that you have to re-touch up during the day -- because you dont, but just so that I won't ever lose it). Truly a product worth trying.

This is the very BEST hairstyler and hair dryer in one! I have very fine, thick, shoulder lenght hair and was a little skeptical that this product would be usefull for me. It is! Actually it is the best hair styling product I have ever purchased. It dries and sets my hair very quickly, usually in five minutes or less. What a timesaver. I am so delighted with this product that I purchased eight (8) to keep in my closet so I don't have to hunt for the best product EVER!!!

I love the fragrance of Happy, I have the perfume and body lotion as well as this body wash.  Even if you use a different brand of perfume, you should get this body wash.  It's light and pretty--citrus with soft floral.  Showering with it is a refreshing, energizing experience, and it leaves my skin soft and silky.  The scent is light enough that it won't clash if you use other fragrances. It's really comforting in the mornings--highly recommended!

Not sure how someone in their early 20's can be worried about wrinkles!  One has to have wrinkles in order to apprecialte the results of this product.  I am in my early 60's and have very wrinkly upper eye lids.  All I have to do is use one drop of this product on my eyelids to see instant results.  It doesn't seem to matter if you use it over or under moisturizer.  I use it before I put on my makeup and it has saved me from going for eyelift surgery!  I think that says allot

If your into light smells, this one is for you.  After becoming pregnant I realized I could not wear most of my perfumes, but I still wanted to wear some sort of fragrance.  This one is perfect because it is very light, and smells just like a lemon with a bit of sweetness!

I was having a very bad week and the other day I fell down and today I was aching so much I didn't want to get out of bed. But, I had to and I figured today was a good day to try Wiccy Massage bar. It feels cool on the skin and you can smell the peppermint and cinnamon it smells really good. This product works because almost all my aches are gone. Highly Recommended

I got this for my boyfriend, who works all day lifting heavy plants in a nursery. He loved it from the minute I applied it to his sore back. The smell is calming, and the spices warm up the sore muscles like an icy-hot patch, but much better. It melts easily into the skin, but lasts a long time. It feels so creamy and warm. Now he always begs me to give him a massage

Woooo! This one lets it presence be known! It is a great thing, but it definitely kicks up some smell- not necessarily a bad smell, just a Strong one!! It has a cinnamony/rosemary smell that will kick your sinuses into high gear. The beans and the melty oils are great and they certainly do their job, just don't expect to rub yourself down at the gym and head back to work! Be prepared to bathe before sleeping with a body covered in this. Rosemary and whatever else is in it will keep you awake.

If you haven't used a massage bar before, this takes a little getting used to. It's solid at room temperature, but melts right away in contact with skin. This bar has cinnamon and other lovely things to really 'sink in' and warm up muscles. Not as much as medicated creams like Ben Gey and such, but enough to add to a good massage. And it smells so much better. The aduki beans are a nice addition, as they definately help with the massage around the neck and upper shoulder areas, as well as the bottom of your feet. A little goes a very, very long way. I give my husband weekly back and foot rubs with this and we've had the same bar for about three-four months and its still going strong

Tough to understand unless you are near one of their outlets.  I found this soap in the Macy's on Michigan in Chicago.  It is highly addictive.  They send samples of other soaps and things with each order, and we like almost all of them.  Good stuff

Normally at our house, we threaten to wash the cats (they don't like water too much and will normally only peer curiously into the bathroom when I'm in the tub. Now and then they have played with bubbles), but this does have an amusing name. 

I did think it was more like "Honey, I lost the soap in the tub again." This is one melting dream soap that can easily slip away into the depths of a luxurious lush bath. This soap is good with the Think Pink bath bomb and some of the Creamy Candy Bath bubble bar. 

If you love this, you may simply faint when you order a Sultana of Soap (oh my!). Avowash (avocado and olive oil), Ooh La La (lavender) and Bohemian (lemon) are also fun.

Loved the scent and feel of this soap! I'm a bath product junkie and my latest cravings have been for anything honey scented and this soap is wonderful.  My only complaint is that it did use up pretty quickly and left a mess in the dish.  I'd not leave it in the shower next time.

This product leaves your skin slightly sticky feeling (not in a bad way, it disapears in a few minutes). The scent is light enough to not be overbearing (though it smells stronger in the shower). It does help if you have slightly dry skin. Overall, I really liked this product and plan to savor it till the end

If you have tried such products as ProActiv to help clear up your breakouts and haven't been that impressed, try this line of Murad products.  (Clarifying)  Used after the Clarifying Cleanser, this toner leaves your face feeling fresh.  It removes all the residual oil from your skin, but doesn't leave your face feeling dry.  Just the opposite, it hydrates your skin while helping to control breakouts and oil.  I have nice clear skin for the first time in years - all due to this line of Murad products.  I couldn't be happier

Murad Clarifying Toner has helped in controlling my facial breakouts. I have been using this product for six weeks and noticed how great my skin looks. This toner is so cooling when applied. Murad Clarifying Toner features algae extract to help in diminishing the excess oil in the skin. The toner gets deep down to my pores and effectively hydrates my skin without any irritation.

The Essie Protein Base Coat is two steps in one and while you are giving yourself a manicure or pedicure (or taking these along to the salon - a good idea because they are better than the other polishes and dry faster!), you will notice how this smoothes out your nails and prepares them for a perfect nail polish finish. This formula contains camphor, silica and collagen for healthy, strong and flexible nails. The nail polishes also go on perfectly and there are so many colors to choose from!

Safari has been discontinued and is no longer sold in department stores. I think it was one of Ralph Laurens better perfumes. I wore it from the year it came out until it was discontinued. I was complimented on it constantly. I even had a guys angling to sit by me just to breathe in the scent. The reason I think it was dicontinued - it changed into a totally different scent after only a few months of the opening spray. The real fragrance didn't last long enough. My sister had a bottle that she kept for three years - it reeked! I know, I know, all perfume ages, but not like Safari did. It happened to fast, within three months or less. So I loved it, and wore it for years, but I can understand why some people complained about it. I was thinking about making a purchase here at Amazon, but I don't want to get the old smelly stuff.

The new Estee Lauder lipsticks seems to be very moisturizing and smooth and this lip liner helps to keep your pouty look all in place. The lipstick alone does not give you well defined lips and this liner really takes the look from a 5 to a 10. You can apply it before or after you apply lipstick and it works equally well. If you can find the cognac shade, it goes very well with the sumptuous lipstick.

Burberry Brit is one of my staple fragrances ... I'm on my third bottle which my mother thankfully supplied me at Christmas this year. Brit has a deep, warm vanilla amber scent, but it is not sweet. It is rich and oh-so-slightly woody, with a creamy undertone. It's fairly long-lasting too. If, like me, you're not big on florals, you'll appreciate Brit's spicy amber glow. I don't find it particularly strong, but then my tastes in fragrance run on the strong side (as long as it's not overpowering). I know I'll love this one for years to come.

My mother bought this perfume for me two Christmases ago. At first I thought it was too heavy. However, once I started wearing it I fell in love with it. I've never received so many compliments on a perfume in my life. Men and women randomly stop me in hallways, in restaurants, and the street ti ask me what I am wearing. "You smell so good..." I wear it everyday now and am on my third bottle.

I absolutely adore the Burberry Brit fragrance! As someone who dislikes floral scents, this scent is for me. I absolutely adore the deep vanilla and spice accents. While it may be a bit intense for summer, it is perfect for fall and winter. The scent also wears well throughout the day. Unlike many other, perhaps less expensive perfumes, this scent will stay with you throughout the day. I love catching just a hint of the fragrance as I take off my coat or untie my scarf on chilly days. Buy it for yourself or as a gift, you will not be disappointed

I have searched for a great perfume for many years, and have finally found it! Burberry Brit is sexy, yet not overpowering. Both men and women are attracted to the smell, and I suggest smelling it in Vogue and then ordering several bottles before it is out of stock

       What is it they say about love?  A better question might be what don't they say about love?  It makes the world go round.  What the world needs now is more of it.  It's a many splendored thing.  A moments madness.  The list goes on and on. .Little wonder it's also the inspiration for a bold, seductive new fragrance from Cacharel.	
	
	It arrives in a brilliant red bottle, the color of a heart, the shade of passion.  Amor Amor is both romantic and vivacious with top notes of pink grapefruit, blood orange, sweet mandarin and black currant.  Heart notes are found in apricot, red rose, jasmine melati flower and lily of the valley.  

	Available in 1 oz, 1.7 oz. and 3.4 oz. sprays, it promises to be a highly coveted fragrance at an affordable price.

We lose so much time over it - and you know what I'm talking about, you debaters of scissors v. tweezers - but God has told me to tell y'all to rest your souls. Thusly: Proper nasal care can only be accomplished with tweezers.

Yes, there's pain. But pain is the holy child of vanity, to whom we must bow down

Is so true of this product.  I have to admit when I first saw the price tag of this product, it was half out of curiousity that I purchased.  I mean could a pair of $20 tweezers be THAT much better than the ole $1.75 or $3 pairs at home?  

Well if your asking yourself that question, YES!  These things have amazing grip and can pull the tinyiest of hairs.  Things that you would have to dig with normal tweezers until you finally rub your skin raw.

Without a doubt, you will get your moneys worth from this product as well as be amazed at their performance.  It's the type of "WOW" that makes you feel like, "How did I ever get along without these before".

Worth every penny and I'll never buy another cheap tweezer again.  These have lasted for years and still retain their fine point.

These tweezers rock! This gets all the hairs you want gone fast and effectively. This is also easy to manuever around the eyebrow area.  I can get into spots and get the hairs I could not get with any of my other tweezers which I have since gotten rid of.  This is worth the money.  These tweezers will last and last and you will not be disappointed. You can also choose from a variety of cool colors too. I highly recommend these tweezers.

I had an Amazon reward certificate and was looking for something practical to use it on.  It so happened that I needed new tweezers.  I read the reviews and thought I'd give these a try.  Wow, I can't believe the difference in quality from any other tweezers I have ever owned.  They almost seem to adhere to whatever your are trying to grasp.  It is so easy to precisely and almost painlessly remove even the finest eyebrow hair.  Tweezerman Tweezers ROCK!

Tweezerman really are the BEST tweezers on the market and to say, the cutest. With different colors to choose from, the fact that they're reliable and strong only adds to them.

Tweezers gone dull and you need them sharpened? You don't need to go to the store anymore and buy new ones. Tweezerman sharpens them free of charge with S&amp;H so long as you send in an envelope.

My final point: I don't see a point in buying any other tweezer since you buy one pair and it lasts you the rest of your life

I picked this up at my local Body Shop store because truthfully I couldn't decide between all the flavors in large sizes, and I got to try all these beautiful scents in one easy purchase. Great for traveling or simply displaying in the bathroom, these little gems make me happy in the morning when an extra ompf is needed to get me out of my warm bed and under cold water!

My favorite so far is the Mango, and in all honesty I don't like to eat the fruit raw, but I love it in mixed recipes and in bath and body products.

Each wash is 2 oz. and enough for a few uses, making it fun to do a switcheroo every time I hop in the shower. The scents are Tropical Mango, Coconut, Passionfruit, Strawberry, and Satsuma.

Mango is lovely, slightly tangy and bitter , like a grapefruit but with a velvety sweet scent that is a pleasure to use. This is a gel.

Coconut is another favorite, creamy and juicy, like real coconut milk, not overly sweet but pure and authentic smelling. This is a creamy wash, not a gel.

Passionfruit is refreshing, green and purple at the same time, smells like a mixture of kiwis, lemons and melon,  a contrast of tart and sweet succulence.

Strawberry is not bad but has a hint of plastic in it, it's not the truest flavor I came across, but it seems pretty hard to fabricate, since the fruit itself is slightly sour and delicate. For a shower gel its fine, but if this was a flavored food product I'd probably skip it. This comes in the gel form.

Satsuma is crazy, a sugary tropical warm orange like hot flavor that turns my bathroom into a wicked retreat from reality. Very strong and pungent but fun when I'm in the mood for intense tropical experience. This comes in the gel form.

Overall I have nothing but praise, although the price is a bit high, but the whole set is a fun way to try out all the flavors and makes a great gift, it also lookS beautiful in the see through container, like a carousel of colors waiting to be enjoyed.

Okay, it's silly but I originally tried this cologne because Liv Tyler was the model for its launch. Well, I was hooked.  Although its base is rose peony, it's not strongly floral.  When it dries down, the scent that captivates you is the star anise - spicy and a little addicting.  And it lasts so long!  One little spritz and I'm good for the whole day

I have tried probably every Volumizing product on the market (including the much lauded Phyto Volumizer) but I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this Kerastase product so much! It is by far the best! It leaves your hair silky smooth and with TONS of volume (even after blowdrying it for 15 minutes). It doesn't leave behind a gummy or sticky residue. It is a little expensive but it has a lot of bang for its buck and I would even pay more for it if I had to. I will never use anything else again!

I've enjoyed using the Loc Butter on my natural hair as well as my two pre-teen daughters' natural hair.  It is a tad heavy and sticky - just right for keeping plaits, braids, and twists, frizz free.  I also found that it works well for hot combing and flat ironing.  The scent is kind of musky/spicy, and we like it.   It doesn't overwhelm, but is quite pleasant. (the scent is not as pleasant with heating implements) I don't think it would be good for daily use because it would probably get very heavy and greasy (it has beeswax, and multiple oils).  I don't have locs but it works beautifully for my daughter's two strand twists.  The twists hold together well with minimal frizzing.

I purchased 07 sheer caramel, which is a pretty accurate description of that color (warm medium brown).  It's a very natural and beautiful shade.  It is sheer as the name implies, but there is still a good amount of color.  The smell is pleasant and sweet, with a smooth and light texture.  It has the coverage of a lipstick and the moisture of a gloss, without being sticky. It's kind of like a tinted lip balm, but the color is more substantial.  It actually feels better on my lips than a balm.  The appearance is semi-glossy, but not goopy looking like a traditional gloss. There is a little bit of sparkle, but it's not chunky like glitter.  I would prefer it not to have any sparkle at all, which is my only complaint (and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5).  I think the formula is shiny enough that it doesn't need any added glimmer effect.  Honestly, I think cosmetics manufacturers have gone overboard with putting glitter in virtually everything.  Enough already!  Anyway, I still like this lipstick despite my sparkle hang-up.  It is packaged in a slim silver tube that is very chic, simple, and easy to apply.

I have really long hair and I use a lot of conditioner. This is a good treatment for the winter when my naturally blonde hair starts to grow out a bit darker than my summer haircolor. It doesn't lighten hair very dramatically at all on its own, but it conditions very well and smells really nice, like a lemony custard.

I use this by warming it slightly in the microwave so it sinks in better, then applying it to dry hair. I tie my hair into a bun and wait twenty minutes or so, then rinse it gently, wash my hair using The Blonde shampoo, and condition with a light conditioner.

If you don't really want your hair lightened much and just want a bit of extra shine and highlight to your blonde hair, this is great on its own. If you want a more dramatic effect, The Blonde solid conditioner works for a stronger effect. The Blonde can be drying though so I do like to use them together

I have been using Carol's Daughter for about 8 months now and I swear by this line! I really like the Kizzi because it slicks down edges, baby hairs and tames frizz. IT ALSO WORKS WONDERS ON BRAIDS! I have been able to keep my cornrows an extra two weeks because I tie my hair with Kizzi every night. Here is the secret: Spary hair with CD Black Vanilla Leave in Conditioner and then use about a quarter size of Kizzi on the edges of the braids all the way down to wear your real hair ends. In the morning your hair will look smooth, polished and shiney!

Happy Heart - even better than the original Happy which is a bit more Citrusy. I use it day or night.    

The roll-on applicator is a great idea as it's small enough for a purse yet lasts and lasts. It doesn't leak and the cap doesn't fall off either.

Even better, it doesn't seem to trigger attacks with my allergic friends. (You're wearing perfume but I'm not sneezing! OMG! What kind that?)

I cannot say enough about this fantastic product.  Clinique has (probably) the best skincare system out there.  My face was a mess and other moisturizers had clogged my pores and caused terrible breakouts.  The moisturizing gel is the third step in their skincare regime.  First, you wash your face with the Clinique soap best-suited for your skin type (normal, dry or combination/greasy), then you follow it with their clearing lotion (ie exfoliant/astringent) and you (finally) apply this gel to your face and neck.  Their moisturizer is also available as a lotion for for drier complexions.  The gel is oil free and gets the job done, without clogging your pores, while working with its PH balance.  Highly reccomended!!

   I originally received a sample of this in the mail.  I was so surprised by the scent of pumpkin and spice when I used it that I immediatley went online searching for it to purchase.  Not only that, but the scent stays with you all day.   There will be moments when I have to smile because I catch it in the air.  Smells so good you want to eat it.  It also made my hair feel so healthy and soft.  Definitely worth the price.

My skin is very sensitive and my face breaks out in little bumps if I use anything that leaves a residue.  I've used Cetaphil soap for years but it doesn't get all of my eye makeup off.  I bought this on impulse and it's the best face cleanser I've ever found.  It doesn't dry my skin at all, and removes every speck of makeup.  I think the soy also evens out my skin tone

Fresh is a company I have been interested in for awhile. I first fell in love with their product line when I used the Brown Sugar Body Polish. I knew this was a product that would become a beauty staple around my house. I have since purchased several other items from Fresh, especially from their skincare, bodycare and fragrance lines. I find that Fresh Soy Formula f21c Face Cleanser is one of their best products. And the price is right, especially given the cost of some of the high quality face cleansers on the market.

This unique face cleansing gel is fabulous. The texture is somewhat unusual. It is a clear gel and feels very slippery when applied. The gel foams, ever-so-slightly, almost like a lotion,  and feels great on dry skin. The face cleanser does an excellent job of removing makeup and leaving the skin soft, comfortably clean and glowing. It also tones the skin, revives the eyelid area and conditions the eyelashes in the process. What could be better? And all in one single product! 

For the winter months, this is a perfect compromise between the fresh, clean feeling of a gel and the comfortable, soothing feeling of a lotion. It is my normal-to-dry skin's new favorite cleanser. Soy Face Cleanser contains rose extract, cornflower extract, glycerin, mallow extract, chamomile extract, ginseng, aloe, soybean powder, soybean protein, borage seed oil, cucumber extract, vitamin A, vitamin E and gentle cleansing agents.

I cannot recommend Fresh skin and body products enough - and the Fresh Soy Formula Face Cleanser is a winner!

Clinique makes the best eyeshadows, they're so light and creamy! They don't crease and don't fade. I love Beach Plum (a rich, shimmery plum and shimmery-gold duo), it perfectly accents my brown eyes. They're a bit pricey, but they're worth every penny

I bought this product at Sephora with some friends. I'd give it a 4 out of 5.

POSITIVES:
absolutely beautiful colors
they can be layered and mixed to create new shades of gloss
small enough to fit in the tiniest pocket or purse
the case is worth keeping after you use up the glosses, I still have mine :)
the flavor is delisious, so realistically the taste of sugary sweetness

NEGATIVES:
they are a little on the sticky side
all the shades cannot possibly look good on one person. I recommend spliting them with a friend
they are not long lasting, the flavor lasts longer then the color
the tubes are incredibly tiny

I have been a rabid fan of Lush products for years, often having them shipped to me form Canada before they were so easy to buy in the states. Each product has a certain Earthy quality it and its nice knowing that people who make each an every single on of these luscious concoctions love them as much as the customers do and it shows!

The Karma soap looks like a slab of gold in shape but is really reminiscent of candied carrots I would find in fruit cakes I used to eat as a kid growing up in Poland. The clarity of the fiery jewel like color is quite attractive as it makes for a nice soap to put in the guest bathroom or for self spoiling with hand made soaps that beat the other cookie cutter types by a mile. The scent itself is a breezy breath of citrus with mother earth embedded deep in the core. The lavender and patchouli are a whisper, a shadowy backbone to the zest and freshness. The multidimensionality of layering scents makes fore a very uplifting experience and I can smell the heady aromas every time I was my hands with it. I also love the Karma perfume, which smells almost exactly as the soap.

I find that my hands don't get as dry when I use this glycerin soap as opposed to regular soaps laden with chemicals and lards. But I always use a hand cream afterwards, preferably one of those gooey Burt's Bees creams that come in heavy glass jars. My hands never crack or get dry no matter how dry the air or how cold it is when I used Lush soaps and a good hand cream.

for its fresh, zesty, orangy smell.
generally, i prefer soaps to shower creams and lotions, cause soaps make me feel squeeky clean. but they also dry my skin out like crazy, so i try not to use them often.
but when i do, then it's one of my three favorites among lush soaps.
the fact that they are all natural and not tested on animals is added value in my world :

Smells like Xanadu!  I feel like grabbing my rollerskates, putting on some lip gloss and flying into another dimension! The forward note is tangerine/mandarin, for me. Followed by tiny fingers of vanille absolute with an earthy backbone. I absolutely hate patchouli. I know they say there is patchouli in here, but I can't detect it even as it wears throughout the day. Good lather, translucent fire orange color are stimulating. The soap goes well with the Karma Shampoo bar. This is one of my top 3 favorite Lush products.

I make my own hand and body soaps, so I'm pretty picky about anything store bought. I was given this as a sample with an order from Lush, and I loved it instantly! I haven't been able to duplicate the smell exactly in my own soaps, so I am willing to buy it just for that alone. I'm not a fan of patchouli in general, but it doesn't smell as strong on this soap. It blends very well with the other scents and smells divine! My entire bathroom smells great when it's hung up drying in the shower. I highly recommend it and have even given others karma as gifts, too

I love the pattern of squares on my 100 ml cologne bottle. Just one spray can make me feel utterly happy and clean. Im wearing shorts and a tshirt on this lazy Sunday and listening to Nick Drake, for some reason, his voice sounds even better with Brit sprayed on me. I know there's no logic but it's just how it is. This cologne can be described as a superstarter to one's eventful day, either at home whiling away time or when outside conquering the world.

It's funny and loveable how Amazon describes this fragrance by correlating it to British Men.(" Epitomizing the modern, British man, Brit For Men captures a relaxed elegance and effortless style.") I must say it makes me feel confident.

Thanks mom. You should go to Dubai more often and get me Burberry colognes.

This cologne is very spicy and is perhaps one of my favorites next to Burberry Fragrance for men. Whereas Burberry Fragrance was fruity, Brit is slightly different in that the scent is more floral and certainly more spicy (and yet not as heavy or as complex as London).

For something as spicy I'm quite surprised with how light this one comes across (in comparison with London which was just a little too heavy for me). I have to agree with other reviewers and say that it's still by far very masculine indeed. Vanilla is immediately noticed, as well as more fruity undertones which only increase as time passes ("juicy green mandarin," perhaps but you need to be a poet to sense it... again, admittedly sweet). Warning, this product is not nearly as citrus/lemon/orange the Burberry Fragrance; instead it follows in London's footsteps and provides spiciness in yet a more minimal way.

Can be worn in a similar fashion, either for formal affairs or casual ones, though I'd gather it is selected most often for casual ones (I did find a similarity between this and Chanel's Allure, and yet I find Allure much more pungent... I love Allure, but if you want something a little more mellow for the night, this is your product).

Sweet, spicy, deep and complex Brit marks itself as my second favorite from the Burberry line - sharing the spot right on top with the Burberry Fragrance! Can be worn daily without becoming tiring, a feature which I think it holds over Burberry Fragrance whose citrus-sweet Fragrance may become an annoyance

This cologne smells great! It is much more appealing than Chanel's Allure Sport, Versace's Blue Jeans, or Ralph Lauren's Polo.

If you like a slightly stronger, sophisticated scent, this is a great option

This vanilla-banana cream smells delectable, mostly light natural vanilla with a hint of fresh banana, and is a thick cream that works well and is very nourishing. It doesn't sink in anywhere near as quickly as Dream Cream or Skin Sin (or the now- discontinued Potion), but it works wonderfully for chronically dry skin. 

I apply it in a thin layer after a shower or bath in the morning and the moisture thins it out so it sinks in right away, and a thicker layer at night so it can sink in fully while I sleep.

The lotion works perfectly, but honestly, I buy it for the scent. It isn't often you can find such a naturally scented vanilla lotion. The banana is so light you can barely smell it, but gives an overall feeling of an ice-creamk or lovely dessert scent, rich and delicious.

I have a problem with most synthetic scents changing on my skin, and so I am pleased that Lush relies so heavily on natural plant essences and infusions.

This stuff is great for when my skin needs some hardcore moisturizing. It might feel greasy to some, but when your skin is very dry, it's not like that. If you feel it's too heavy for day wear, it does work great as a nighttime treatment. It sort of smells like oatmeal and vanilla ice cream to me

HI

<review_text>
I initially bought Sympathy for the Skin because of the smell (I just love it!) and for the reviews that I've read.  I was really excited to get home and try it, but was a little disappointed.

The lotion smelt wonderful, but when I used it, my hands felt like the lotion didn't really sink it.  Sympathy for the Skin left a slight shinny coat on my hands and felt a little oily.  At first I realized that I was using too much, so I started to use less and that really cut back on the oiliness.  Since I use this at night time, it's not that big of a deal, but I wouldn't use this as a day cream because it's a little to heavy for me.

Besides the oiliness, the lotion did work well and really helped to moisturize my hands, which are usually dry and cracked because of so much dishwashing.  I follow with LUSH's Lemony Flutter Cuticle Butter and my hands have never looked better.

Will try some of LUSH's other lotions first before I buy this again.  Overall good product

"Sympathy for the Skin"?  Hmmmmm, seems to me that consolation, condolences and commiseration should be extended to those who don't have a small tub of this at the ready.  They probably have to put up with dry, tight-feeling skin crying for a kind word or, better yet, a moisturizing body lotion.

Truth be told,  skin needs our utmost attention - summer, winter, springtime and fall.  In the cold months it's buried under so much warm clothing that it can't breathe or dehydrated by central heating.  In the warm months it's parched by the sun and blown dry by air conditioning.  Yet, it stays with us.

When we're having fun, our skin is not.  Did you have a ball dancing all night?   Think of how those tired tootsies feel in the morning.  Were you the belle of the beach playing volleyball in your teeny-weeny bikini?  Too much sun, eh?  Your skin took it not only on the chin but all over your toned bod.  It needs TLC.

"Sympathy for the Skin" is a rich, soothing potion of a lotion laced with healing ingredients such as Almond Oil, Cocoa Butter, Sandalwood Oil, Fresh Bananas.    Creamy in appearance it's a luxurious emollient that is absorbed quickly by your grateful skin and leaves a lovely subtle scent of vanilla.

There are those days when I must have a soothing hot bath, which I know depletes skin of moisture.  So, after bathing I simply pat skin with a towel and then smooth on "Sympathy for the Skin" while skin is still damp.  Works wonders!  That's what's known as having your soak and silky skin, too

I am 32 years old and have been using the Idealist system for about 2 weeks now and I have definitely noticed an improvement in the softness/clarity/blotchiness and overall appearance of my skin. I had acne as a teenager and I also have larger pores. The scars have diminished (not completely, mind you!) and my pores are much smaller. I also have sensitive skin and this system does not irritate my skin. My skin also tends to be flaky when irritated and the idealist system had taken care of the problem. My advice is that you must use the Idealist in the morning and at night for your skin to get the total benefit of the micro-d product. I tried using the Idealist only at night and the benefits were not as great. It's expensive, but worth it. By the way, I have been using the .5 oz. sample size of the micro-d and I still have plenty left after about 5 uses. So this stuff will last you a very long time. You only have to use it twice a week (use it any more and it will irritate your skin). 

The first time you use it, you may be a little uncomfortable as there is a definite warming sensation. It also felt a little uncomfortable and made my skin a little pink, but it subsided very quickly and it was all worth it in the end. 

Great product

I love Fresh's Sugar perfume and so I was busting to try this deodorant to match.  Not disappointed at all!!  It's great and smells exactly the same as the fragrance.  It's so more like lemon than sugar, but that's what is fresh about this which makes it perfect in summer time.  It glides on well and doesn't leave white marks at all.  When your body temperature is warm, the smell comes out more which I love and if you use it with the matching perfume, then you're going to smell great all day long.  I love this, but I use it only on weekends because it's too nice to use it all up only for work

This is excellent lip gloss. I agree with the previous reviewer. It lasts for a very long time, doesn't feel sticky or liquidy, and doesn't taste bad. Unfortunately, the price is painful at which to look and on the wallet, but it's worth it. I've only tried one color (because of the price) and I think it works very well with my natural skin tones (I use 'Cry Baby'). Next time you're looking for a new lip gloss, check out this one. It's definitely worth it

This is a great alternative to clumpy, mascara and clear mascara - it's in the middle of those two.  It's thin and doesn't clump AT ALL, nice and moist, quick drying.  No smell, and good for my sensitive eyes &amp; contacts.  It doesnt do much besides darken the lashes, though, nothing fancy, and it WILL come off if wetted/rubbed.  It won't run down your face, but it won't survive a good cry

This is my favorite mascara hands down.  I've used this for years now. Even if I do stray I always come back to it.  I use this in Jet Brown.  I think this is the most flattering color for me.  This mascara is phenomenal; it never clumps up on my eyelashes, looks phony, spikey etc.  It goes on perfect everytime and makes my lashes look natural, thick and full. I never can tell when a particular wand is getting old because it does not start to smell bad and it never clumps up like a lot of other mascaras do.  I highly recommend this mascara.  And I will always buy it as long as Clinique never discontinues it.

I cannot say enough about this fantastic product.  Clinique has (probably) the best skincare system out there.  My face was a mess and other moisturizers had clogged my pores and caused terrible breakouts.  The moisturizing gel is the third step in their skincare regime.  First, you wash your face with the Clinique soap best-suited for your skin type (normal, dry or combination/greasy), then you follow it with their clearing lotion (ie exfoliant/astringent) and you (finally) apply this gel to your face and neck.  Their moisturizer is also available as a lotion for for drier complexions.  The gel is oil free and gets the job done, without clogging your pores, while working with its PH balance.  Highly reccomended!!

I received CD lip butter a few days ago and I love it. It naturally moisturizes your lips and makes them feel soft and buttery. It is not overly greasy or waxy like other lip balms. I would recommend it to everyone!

Even in the cold Midwestern weather I have oily skin that's prone to breakouts and this is a great product for oily skin.  It cleans and removes makeup but doesn't feel as though it's stripped my skin of all moisture.  It is a little pricey but it's worth it and you'll have great skin that doesn't still feel oily, or feel too dry, after you wash your face

"Highest of all the oils (Spiritual); approximately 320 MHz. It enhances the frequency of every cell, bringing balance and harmony to the body." ~Connie and Alan Higley

Many rose oils are reminiscent of a rose garden. This rose oil reminds me of a wild rose bush you would find in a cedar forest. There is a hint of comforting cedar wood with varied elements of fragrance not unlike a fine perfume. Spicy notes mingle with sweet rose perfection while delicate high points capture your attention. Of all the rose oils, this one has numerous elements to lift your mood and scent everything from bath products to laundry soaps. The highly concentrated oil will last for a long time. One drop of this in a spray bottle of spring or mineral water and you have a beautifully scented skin refresher. Put a drop on a  cloth and toss it in the dryer for rose scented towels. Add to your fabric softener or drop the tiniest amount on a card you are sending to a friend. 

The sheer value of this product is astounding when you consider how expensive rose oil can be. The high concentration is superior to all other rose oils I've tried and this is very affordable. In this case, you seem to get more than you paid for. If you are looking to add rose oil to your collection, this is the best one I've found for blending with other oils and making bath products and scenting products I use around the house. 

This oil will bring a poetic beauty to your life and can alleviate times of emotional upheaval. Use for dry skin (add to creams), addictive behavior, anger, despair, depression, grief, nervous anxiety, heart problems, emotional fatigue, irritability and insomnia. Since this is highly concentrated, you may want to blend it with jojoba oil first before mixing into beauty products. 

Caswell-Massey also sells a divine Egyptian Musk, Ylang Ylang and Lilac oil. Very affordable oils and unlike other brands were you have to almost pour the oils in the tub, a few drops will do. Highly Recommended. 

~The Rebecca Review 

P.S. The Aroma Vera Pearl Aromatic Pottery Diffuser with a cork lid is perfect with this product.

I have been using these since sometime in the early 1990s. Before the web made them easier to find, we used to ask family friends visiting Hawaii to pick them up for us. I've recommended them to many others over the years because they are easier than a back brush, more vigorous than a wash cloth, and quick-drying. The Salux brand is rougher (and I think better) than the imitations I have since seen

Long enough to wash your back, will wad up something like a pouf, but the texture is perfect! You will wonder why you've ever used a cloth to wash your body (not ideal for the face with sensitive skin).  Makes super lather from your bar or liquid soap.  Rinses clean after every use. It will spoil you! Lasts for years with daily use

I have tried many brands of lipstick, expensive and drugstore brands and this is the best lipstick I have found. I love the texture and sheer color. I was not certain if spending this much on lipstick would be worth it, but it definately was for me. No more searching...I found what I like and I will stick with it. Quality. That's this lipstick in one word

Chanel's Aqualumiere lipstick is, in my opinion, the best lipstick formula on the market. The lipstick goes on as shiny as lipgloss but has the texture of lip balm. The colors, though sheer, still have good pigmentation; the sheerness is actually a benefit because it allows the lipstick color to blend well with your natural lip color, lessening the chance that your lip color will come out looking unnatural. The Aqualumiere line of lipsticks do need to be reapplied more often than a less sheer lipstick, but the lasting power is still relatively high, and reapplication is less of a bother because of the lipstick's texture.

Though I have not tried all the colors, the pinks in this formula--Waikiki in particular--strike me as especially natural and face-brightening

I love these! Wore my last pair out. I love that you can put them on after moisturizing and let them stay on for about ten minutes and then remove them leaving you oil free. They are really great. I also use them when I am touching photos or silver so I don't leave oil smudges on them.

Creed Vetiver is the greatest cologne ever
Very attractive to men and women
The very first time I've used Creed was on New Year'eve 
Then went to few paces such as Whiskey Park, Armani cafe,mostly everyone were asking the same question"what kind of cologne you have on" Few weeks ago,I was at this Lounge call Saint almost 90% of the people asking the same question " I replied that's CREED  one of a kind" buy it now,you will be thanking me later

We purchasedthis for oil control on someone with acne-prone skin, and as a base for makeup on oily facial areas. It works great for both. It has a smooth, cool texture that feels refreshing when applied, and is absorbed quickly, leaving the skin soft and smooth. I highly recommend it for acne treatment! One note though- It must be used on a daily basis for results.

i received this scent(the mid-sized white bottle)for christmas 2006. it's beautiful! a really warm, vanilla-ish scent that lingers forever and is incredibly comforting and sexy as hell. this is a little much for office or casual wear, but i definitely think it would go over well for evening or a date-i've found that guys respond pretty well to it.

also-the packaging is exquisite. the bottles are solid fuschia, white, or orange and shaped like a decorative bud vase. i love the box the scent came in, white with some sort of pink and orange bird on it. i liked it so much that i actually store the perfume in the box rather than throw it away. a really, really special product

I just returned from a cruise on the Carnival Spirit.  I was given a sample in the gift shop.  I went back down to purchase it as I loved it.  Alas, they had carried 120 bottles on the previous cruise which they sold out of immediately as their price was so good.  Most perfumes are offensive to my sinuses but this one is not overpowering and the scent really is wonderful.  I just can't imagine someone not liking it.

This scent is very light and sugary. I enjoyed it because I prefer fragrances that are more spice-based than floral-based, and in this scent the note of sugared almonds stands out to me the most. It's a good summer scent because it isn't too heavy and it's very sweet.

I gave this a four out of five stars because while it was enjoyable, it just didn't have that certain 'something' that makes a fragrance truly memorable

This is a very fresh gel. I really felt the difference in my skin next morning. Actually, in my opinion, I don't need to apply "a cherry-sized ball" of gel to my face. If I do so, I feel my face a little sticky, however, a smaller amount of gel will let your skin feel comfortable and will do the work. It smells slightly of natural bergamote and hibiscus. I think is perfect for sensitive skin but if you are allergic to alantoine this gel is not for you. Thank you

I was never able to find a scent that wasn't too much flower or too much musk.  This one is perfect.  The scent is feminine but not too flowery and the bubble bath is very rich.  Only a little is necessary.

If you are a fan of subtle, high-quality scents, this product is for you. If you want to stand out with your fragrance (ie: We can all smell you from miles away) skip this scent. I'd also recommend Philosophy's Kiss Me gloss and any of their vesatile body washes. Enjoy

I love this! It has a powdery, clean smell that isn't overpowering- but even if it was, I could probably stand to smell it all day long! I used maybe about 1/4 of the bar, but it still made nice masses of bubbles! Unfortunately, the bubbles disintegrated pretty quickly...I didn't mind though, and didn't feel it was worth taking off a star, because it left my water scented and my skin soft. This is something I wish I could use at every bath

When the weather outside is blustery and ugly, I like nothing better than to get into a hot bath with half a sweet Hot Milk? bubble bar and a spicy Hot Java ballistic. It's one of my favourite Lush bath combinations, for an all-over warmth and general good feeling that will carry you into dreamland.

I grew up using a square hairbrush just like this one, and was disappointed that all of the hairbrushes that you find in stores were much narrower.  This is an excellent men's hairbrush

The deep purple color of this soap holds memories of grapes and lavender blossoms. In fact, the organic grapes in this product are from Provence. The main natural ingredients are lovely and include: Water, Lavender, Honeysuckle, Marigold, Grape Juice, Rosemary Oil, Thyme Oil, Lavender Oil and Rosebuds. I found the fragrance to be very elegant, like walking through a field of lavender along a paved path in high heels by the light of the moon in a chiffon gown. It is silky, sensuous and very relaxing. Recommended for romantics who dream of outdoor gardens filled with lavender and kisses by rosebushes.

I ordered this soap just because I thought it would look nice in my bathroom and not to really use. I do have to say, however, I am pretty tempted. One warning I do have to say is it was 90 degrees (F) outside the day this soap showed up. It was not melted but was pretty soft. We just let it sit for an hour in the AC and it formed right back up. It did take a while for this soap to show up though so dont order it if you dont want to wait

It seems as if it is working for me.  I notice a slight difference in the 2 weeks that I have been using it.  But on the bottle it says to use it for a month.  I have noticed, though that it makes my stretch marks more visible? I don't know if this could be caused by my tummy having more elasticity and firming because I am also working out, or from the product. However, it smells nice and is not sticky like I thought it would be.  Overall, it is a wonderful product and I would definately recommend it to anyone whose tummy was severly stretched during pregnancy

It is very delicate. Does not irritate the skin. Complexion looks improved after 2 or 3 times of using it. My friends notice the difference and the skin gloves. It is not easy to wash it off and you get a lot of hydrogen foam vs only few enzyme tablets(little minus for that),does not work toward acne but I'm still happy with it

This razor's best virtue for me is its ability to cut a thick beard without clogging like the multi blade cartridges out there. I always dreaded shaving after a hunting or fishing trip. Even the old Gillette twist-open requires that it be partially opened to properly rinse out the cream and whisker sludge. This guy has a nice round cavity underneath each cutting edge that allows water to wash everything away. Even shaking it in a bowl will clear it most of the time. If it should clog, one can blow it out quite easily. I have only used the lower settings, and they are all I seem to need with good blades. The Gillette blades sold in the US are horrible, BTW. Use Merkur blades or Swedish Gillettes for the best shave.

My only complaint is that the alignment marks to match up the top and body are faint, and the adjustment marks do not line up properly, and I am forced to do math to get repeatability. I have higher expectations for German engineering and the price.

This thing is overpriced for what it is, but a good shave is worth a lot, and you only buy it once

..Is Eau Des Merveilles, which I've been wearing for the past year.
I have tried and tested many, many perfumes over the years, and never really settled on one definitive scent personal to me.
 If a good fragrance is important to you, then you know the one you choose is key - I'm glad to say I have found it. 
And simply, if you wear Eau Des Merveilles once, both men and women, will complement you on how good you smell! Now, who can get bored of that?

This perfume contains all my favourite components especially vetiver, bitter orange and 'BALSAM of PERU'. It takes me away to where I want to be, (teases my imagination), even though I may sometimes be at a boring place or with boring people. It makes me smile, and I can't wait to start the day after wearing it :)

It's hard to find this product online on the places you'd think it would be like Sephora.com, Gloss.com or Neiman Marcus.com.  I am very happy to have found my favorite moisturizer on Amazon.com so now I don't have to brave the crowds in the brick and mortar Sephora or, let's say Saks Fifth Avenue where they hawk you like carnival barkers.  Even the Sephora salespeople have become more aggressive than their original philosophy of letting the customer browse uninterrupted.  This moisturizer is perfect if you hate anything greasy on your skin.  It's light, yet truly moisturizes and is the least sticky and stinky of any I've ever tried.  If you even get one or 2 pimples from other moisturizers, you won't have to worry about using this one.  Great for oily or combination skin.  I'm forty and I still love it!  Anything else slides off or makes me break out.   The only annoying thing is that my boyfriend uses most of it

This is a very good cologne 
Cologne is not suppose to be overbearing ...... FOOL 
because after 15 minutes your sense of smell is dulled by it but EVERYONE can stilll smell it 
Trust me I got several phone numbers from this and scored as well

To those of you saying "it doesn't last, I can't smell it half-way through the day", you're not supposed to be able to smell your own cologne, if you can, you've put too much on and will most likely offend people with your overbearing scent!!!!

It smells great and lasts as long as any other cologne I've tried

It turns your water a pretty, pale apple green color. Oh and I didn't have any glitter in mine either, so don't worry all you glitter-phobes

kai gift set is complete - scent is very floral, like gardenias. be advised that the size of the kai roll-on perfume is smaller than a standard lipstick.  $40 is pricey for the quantity, but the roll-on is convenient and i carry in my purse - the spring-like scent is worth it!

I don't know how many mascaras I own but there's always about two or three that I hold as my favorite or just for different occasions. One of those is Hypnose and I really like it for when I go out or just looking for that dramatic look.

Postive:
1.) The look: I've never neccessarily wanted to wear fake eyelashes but they do look almost perfect. Unbelievably, Hypnose gives you that look. It's amazing just how feathery your eyelashes look.
2.) Flaking: This mascara never really flaked on the bottom of my eyes. That's really important to me.

Negative:
1.) This mascara starts out great but after about two and a half weeks it starts emptying out on you. This might just be because there were days when I reapplyed it or simply because I just used it pretty well (1 coat just about everyday because of how much I liked it).

Summary: If you want that natural yet "are those real lashes?!" look, then you'll like this mascara. I'm giving it four stars instead of five simply because of how long it lasts but if you use it once it a while, then it will last you a while

I have normal/oily skin and since I couldn't find another daily lotion for my face I tried Estee Lauder Daywear Plus SPF 15. I use it every day, I usually mix it with my foundation, so it wouldn't break out my skin. The lotion feels good and smooth. It also has a great fresh cucumber scent.I've used it for a while and am very satisfied.

These are just WAY too amazing!! I'm warning you now, if you buy them you will be addicted! I bought this set and split half of it with my best friend, and both of us are hooked and will be ordering a new set for ourselves again. You get so many flavors and they all taste like sugar and smell sooo great! My favorite is the "lemon custard" flavor; if Sugar made that flavor in a full-sized gloss, I'd buy 10!! These glosses are so delicious, you won't be dissapointed!

I add mild color to my hair with "Caca Marron" henna, and I like to use this shampoo in conjunction with a henna treatment.  I feel like it helps the color to set and gives it a good depth. Reincarnate itself does not add color but does add shine (most LUSH solids seem to do this for me)!

Solid shampoos can be intimidating if you have never used them before, but LUSH makes the experience fun and easy.  A little bit of this bar rubbed into your hair creates a nice lather and leaves your hair feeling fresh and clean.  A solid shampoo is also good for travel, as it doesn't spill or explode all over your luggage

Deepening the color and shine of your auburn or brunette tresses is quite possible without needing to use a hair color. Although, an initial coloring with Henna may be recommended, this extends the color and shine and can make your hair feel like it has more body and bounce. 

This is super fun to use in the tub and really works up a lather in your hair that is rich and moisturizing. Rhassoul mud conditions the scalp while Persian Henna gives you color. The scent is like an earthy apple cider with hints of orange and rosemary. Dry this bar out between uses by keeping it in a soap container. 

What I noticed most after the first use was how long my hairstyle lasted and how my hair had that "whish, whish" super clean feel. I also noticed a deepening of the color. If you have oily hair, this is a deep cleansing shampoo that will give you a lot more body along with the shine. Follow with a rich conditioner like LUSH American Cream or the earthy Jungle bar. 

Why are shampoo bars so much fun? This one definitely makes my lush favorites list. If you used one of the lemony shampoos (I Love Juicy) and it took out some of the color, this seems to work well to restore the color. 

~The Rebecca Review
I read the Lush Times like a novel...

P.S. A LUSH sampler would be fun to order!

Solid bar shampoos never sounded that appealing to me,but I thought I would give it a chance.I live in a hard water area and this lathers very well,and after about a week,I had faint highlights that where starting to show.The smell of this shampoo is herbal in base,and pretty much comes out in the rinse.Overall I thought I would never fall in love with a solid shampoo,but I did and it makes me want to try more of the Lush line of shampoos

This smells exactly like its name, vanilla apricot. This is positively addicting when you put it on.  The notes are not too overpowering or synthetic, it just smells good. You smell soooo delicious and when you put it on it makes you think of somewhere warm and sunny. I've been wearing it all this winter and living in Minnesota I need all the warmth I can get.  This also makes me happy when I put it on.  I highly recommend trying this.

Great scent for the middle of winter when you're dreaming of going someplace warm - great scent for summer when you are someplace warm.  The vanilla and apricot blend isn't too fruity, it just smells wonderful.  I wear this scent when I'm cranky and don't want to go to work - it cheers me up and makes me want to earn money so I can buy a plane ticket to Tahiti....I wear it a lot..

I've been using this face wash for about about a month now.  The first two weeks I noticed my skin was fairly dry, which was a nice change from being so oily.  It's a good face wash, and I will probably buy it again.  The only thing that's a little strange, and I read about it in another review, is the smell.  There is a slight sulfur smell right after I rinse off my face, but it really doesn't last long

This is an I-didn't-know-how-much-I-needed-it-until-I-bought-it review. For heaven knows how long I've been distributing conditioner throughout my hair with my fingers, massaging it in, thinking I was doing a thorough job. Not so! After using this Fekkai Detangling Comb the difference was amazing. Obviously, the mere use of fingers had not been able to release the conditioner as it should have been. 

The comb is handcrafted in France with wide teeth, smoothly rounded to protect hair. It's a beauty on its own, as you can see. It allows easy distribution of the product whether it's a conditioner or a treatment mask. It's a breeze to use in the shower and also ideal for comb-outs. 

Frederic recommends applying a conditioning treatment 1-2 times a week to maintain healthy hair. To date, I've been very well pleased with all of Frederic's products and his advice. This is a man who knows hair and how to care for it.

I first began using this product in 2003, when I had my first series of microdermbrasion treatments.  I use very little &amp; it WORKS!  The last place where I purchased this product no longer carries it &amp; they attempted to steer me to Walgreens, where, of course, it was not to be found.  I am 56 years old &amp; strangers that have never met me think I am in my eary 30's.  I am flattered but proud to be the woman I have grown to be.  It took me a while to find this on the internet, but now I have found it once more...I am HAPPY

I purchased this item because some of my lashes had fallen due to my adding warm compresses to my eyes because I had a bump on one of my eyes.  Anyhow, as they had fallen in sporadic clumps, I started looking on the internet for something to help them grow and thus found Talika Lipocils.  I added it to my few eyelashes, from the root up and didn't notice anything until about a month later.  When I did notice the growth and fullness it was kind of sudden.  I was thrilled.  For the first time since they fell I have added mascara to my eyelashes and they are the longest they have ever been.  All I can say to those that feel it doesn't work is that maybe you are not giving it enough time and hoping to see dramatic results in just a few weeks.  Please give it time, it does work... so much so that I am going to order more to ensure I never run out.

       It began following World War II at the ophthalmologic services of the Hospitals of Paris when Dr. Danielle Rochas developed a plant based anti-bacterial unguent to heal those who had suffered serious facial burns.  The results astounded, not only did this unguent heal but her patients' eyelashes grew back!

	So Talika was born and since 1948 these laboratories have produced remarkable products that reverse signs of aging on delicate eye skin.  I've been more than well pleased with my purchases from this French skin care company, especially with Eyelash Lipocils.  This is a plant-based gel that stimulates and replenishes eyelash growth.  It took about four weeks for my lashes to be longer and fuller.  I simply applied in the morning and at bedtime to clean lashes.  Thank you Talika!

	Among the efficacious ingredients in Eyelash Lipocils are Nettle Extract, Horse Chestnut, Allantoin, Soy Lecithin, Witch Hazel, St. John's Wart and Apple Extract.

While this palette is pricey and definitely luxe, it contains about every color anyone needs for every day--from blush to deep brown. The light center color can be used for highlighting under the brow, the darkest color can be used wet for a liner. If you buy just one palette, this might be a great choice

I've used this loose powder for 20 yrs (since high school) and while I have tried other brands from time to time I keep coming back to Clinique because it's the best. It offers great colors that work with all complexions, it has the best texture, goes on like a dream and leaves skin with a wonderful finish. It also has no offensive odor or perfumes. I am blonde with fair to medium skin. My complexion has golden undertones and can be sallow if I apply the wrong makeup colors. Transparency #2 works best for me. I would highly recommend this product

Oil Free and perfect for any skin type, Clinique's Blended Loose Powder has been a top seller and award winner in the prestige makeup category for decades. Each jar (fits on your palm) comes with a swivel out brush (retracted it's about three inches long) that can be used for application and or touchups. Inside the jar is a plastic screen that helps you keep the majority of the powder in the jar even during application -- wonderful for those of us who tend to drop and spill.

Special Tips For Use:
To get the most flawless finish, Clinique recommends an application technique they call the "powder rub down." Tip a tiny amount of powder from the jar into one hand. Very gently rub your hands together to lightly distribute the powder across both palms. Then use your hands to `wash' your face with the powder. This technique helps keep the hairs on the brush from pushing the powder into the pores, accentuating their appearance. Any excess you see afterwards can be whisked off with the swivel-out brush that comes with each jar. 

If you like to touch up with powder throughout the day but don't want to carry the jar or a pressed powder compact, simply dip your brush into the powder in the top of the jar, swivel retract the bristles containing the powder, pop the cap on top, and you can now drop the brush into your purse for a loose powder touch up any time. 

Color Notes: 
-Transparency 1: Has almost no discernible color. For the palest of the pale. This powder is only a hairs breath darker than baby powder.
-Transparency 2: This powder has a noticeable light pink tone. Excellent for perking up a sallow (yellowish) complexion. Also great for Asian women who want that porcelain look.  As a redhead, I find this color powder gives my skin the perk it needs without leaving me looking orange as so many others do.
-Transparency Neutral: Like Transparency 2 without the pink for when 1 is too light and 3 is too dark.
-Transparency 3: Clinique's most popular color . . . by far.  If you've ever received a sample in a Gift before, this is it. A very safe color to choose.
-Transparency 4 Plus: A little darker than the old Transparency 4. For when you have a tan or if you're olive or Hispanic without much of a tan.
-Transparency 5: For when you're dark naturally. A big jump from Transparency 4 Plus. Dark Hispanics and the well tanned fit well here.
-Transparency 6: For dark complexions such as African American, though won't be dark enough for the darkest of dark.
-Transparency Bronze: For all skin colors. Although all the other colors are matte in finish (no shine, glisten, or sparkles) Transparency Bronze is the exception. This color is a deep bronzing powder that goes on the skin surprisingly light and with a hint of sheen for that sun-kissed look. Very pretty applied to the cheeks with just a tiny hint on the forehead, nose, and chin

My background:

I used a Gillette Sensor. It was okay. I upgraded to Sensor XL. It was pretty good. I tried a Mach 3, and I hated it -- it felt like I was wiping my face with a wall of blades. I finally settled on Sensor 3 -- at nearly 2 bucks a blade. It got the job done, but there was no real joy in shaving. Considering I have to do it at least once a day (twice if I'm going out at night) the process should be more enjoyable.

After quite a bit of research, including newsgroups and customer reviews, I splurged and got the Merkur Futur (though I got the chrome finish). 

Shaving is awesome, and I literally look forward to it. Lathering up the shave cream (I use Crabtree and Evelyn Sandlewood) with this brush is a real treat. Super soft, holds a ton of water, and results in a thick lather. (Be warned, the first few times you use it, it stinks like wet badger... but it goes away).

The razor itself is heavy... I mean heavy. Which is good, because you need to let the razor do the work -- NO PRESSURE, OR YOU WILL TAKE OFF YOU FACE). The main difference between this razor and shaving with cartridges, is that you actually feel the blade against your face (as opposed to a chunk of plastic).  Anyone who has had a shave with a barber knows how great this feels.

Once I got the technique down it is as close and smooth a shave as I have ever had. Finishing up with a cold water splash, non-alcoholic toner / aftershave, and a moisturizing lotion, is an invigorating way to start the day.

Please note: as stated above the brush smells a little "badgery" at first, but it goes away. The head of the razor does not pivot, so you have to follow the contours of your face. And the head itself it bulky, so you have to work on your technique around your nose, and under you chin.

In sum, this razor adds an old-school, refreshing routine to my mornings. I love it, and would whole-heartedly recommend it.

Have had this for about 2 years now, switched from the run of the mill razors to this and have never been happier, The bush holds up great and the razor is heavy and makes it feel as if you ae using a solid piece of equipment, which you are, very little maintainence on the razor, change the blades and rinse when changing.  Will not go back to disposable type again

This is a fantastic de shaving kit for wet shaving.  It seems expensive but however when you do the research and look for these items individually its not that pricy.  The razor sells for $60 the brush $80 and the stand $65.  I purchased this for  myself for Christmas 2006 and could not have been happier.  I have always had problems shaving with irritation and ingrown hairs.  With a proper shaving technique and some patience you'll be getting the best shave of your life.  The razor is adjustable meaning you can change the closeness of the blade for different shave settings( 1 to 6 progressively closer) and this razor scores highly on shaving review boards.  I would highly recommend this kit it looks great and is a essential to proper mens grooming.  Pick this up with some high quality shaving cream (Taylors of old bond street, trumpers, truefitt &amp;hill) and a quality aftershave and enjoy.  Shaving can be an awesome experience, something you look forward to.  [...

During my seven year shaving career, I've run the gauntlet of shaving implementations.  After shaving with contemporary disposable cartridge razors and electric razors with `goo', I was left with much to be desired.  Ingrown hairs and razor burn were starting to be a little too familiar.   

Upon taking the set out of the box, I was met by quality and heft from each piece and went straight to the sink for a test drive.  I didn't receive my Art of Shaving lavender scented shave cream until the day after, so I made do with the Aveno shave gel I had on hand.  The first thing I experienced while working up a lather with the badger hair brush, was the distinct smell of wet badger.  After a thorough washing and rinsing, the badger smell had subsided enough to continue.  I had read a few guides from classicshaving.com on the proper technique, but really there was nothing to it.  I made sure my skin was taught and let the weight of the shaver do all the work.  I found that it didn't take much longer than a normal shave, even on my first go.  It took me two weeks of shaving to get my first knick.  At that point, I was getting a little complacent and placed the razor on my chin at an odd angle.  It was very minor and I haven't repeated the folly.  

The smell of wed badger totally subsided after about three days of use; replaced by the soothing smell of lavender.  I'm looking forward to trying out other shave creams.  While the Art of Shaving cream provides adequate lather coverage, I feel that it could be thicker.  I am, however, only comparing it to contemporary shave gels, whose thousands of dollars of R&amp;D could produce incomparable lather results.  I foresee me and my Futur in a life long relationship.  

I asked my dad why he never told me about the satisfaction you can get from a good double edged wet shave.  He said, "I don't know.  I guess it's just been so long since I've used one.  Right now, I'm using one with 4 blades that vibrates."  Guess what he got for father's day.

This is the best hairspray I've ever used! It goes on with a fine mist, that dries fast, so you can shape you hair, then spray again to set it. It's not stiff, yet the hold is amazing and I have very hard to hold baby fine hair. It's not cheap, but once I tried it, I can't live without it!

This is one of the most perfect concealers I have ever used. It goes on nice and creamy (does not pull on your skin when applying) and covers those imperfections.  You also do not need a lot of product to get the job done.  The colors are very natural and I have found a perfect color in Sand for me. I will buy this product again.

I was reluctant to get this one because it was one of the few I was already familiar with from the ole high school days, for many of the same reasons the other reviewer stated, it's been around for a long time and many already have good or bad associations with the scent and other guys who have worn it. I can understand why he gave it three stars, but I'm here to review it based on its scent and merits and not the pop-culture story that surrounds it. 
The fact is, Guy Laroche nailed an almost perfect scent right at the eve of the fragrance for men explosion. While its Polo Green counterpart tended to smell more to me like a pesticide in the bottle, this cologne is both decidedly masculine and decidedly beautiful at the same time. It has elegance and blatant animalism. It is musky and spicy without being floral or citrusy. The age and popularity and generation (zeroing in on age) associated with it will probably prevent me from overusing it, but it still ranks very high in scent tests from woman, possibly continuing to be the best fragrance out there. As for the synthetic scent the other reviewer mentioned, this is probably of the last made before the manipulation of benzene aromatics very common in most newer colognes that he probably likes a lot. Most likely its the lack of organic citrus notes that caused the statement. 
It's not hip or the newest thing, but damn does it smell GOOD!

These tweezers rock! This gets all the hairs you want gone fast and effectively. This is also easy to manuever around the eyebrow area.  I can get into spots and get the hairs I could not get with any of my other tweezers which I have since gotten rid of.  This is worth the money.  These tweezers will last and last and you will not be disappointed. You can also choose from a variety of cool colors too. I highly recommend these tweezers.

Tweezerman tweezers are by far the best tweezers I've ever purchased. They stay sharp for an incredibly long time making tweezing precise, quick and virtually painless. And when they do go dull, all you have to do is send them in for a free sharpening and in a week or so, they arrive back good as new. You can't beat that!

Tweezerman tweezers are simply put - The Best - with capital letters!  I bought my first pair at Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond 2 years ago and I just now broke down to buy another pair because I couldn't even go without them long enough to send them in to be sharpened for free! I tell all my friends (and after one use of mine, they agree) that once you use a Tweezerman you realize that no other tweezers out there even come close to their quality or how well they work.  I have had to fight them out of the clenched fists of quite a few of my friends who have wanted to borrow them. How many times do you make "Rules" for a pair of tweezers?  My number one rule? You can use them, but not take them out of my presence!!  Definitely worth the money - in spades!

Tweezerman really are the BEST tweezers on the market and to say, the cutest. With different colors to choose from, the fact that they're reliable and strong only adds to them.

Tweezers gone dull and you need them sharpened? You don't need to go to the store anymore and buy new ones. Tweezerman sharpens them free of charge with S&amp;H so long as you send in an envelope.

My final point: I don't see a point in buying any other tweezer since you buy one pair and it lasts you the rest of your life

The make-up is very good quality and the colors are pretty, but they are a little too dark for someone fair-skinned.  The lighter colors aren't quite as light as they appear, so the whole effect is a bit dark.  It was a big sell at the store, though, so I think this is only a negative with some people

I have been using it for... uhh.. fifteen years?! 
It is the best blend of sweetness, spice, musk and character I have ever smelled.
There are so many perfumes, especially in the last decade, being launched, and they all smell so similar! They have so little character, and if they do, then they are either too weird, or too something. Or they give me a headache.
This one is unique. Guaranteed.

People who know me know that I am around or close by whenever they smell a trail of Obsession perfume somewhere near my home or office.

I started using Calvin Klein's Obsession when I was a freshman in college, back in 1992, and have used it ever since.  It's served me extremely well the past 14 years as I love the way it smells.  

The scent is, in my perspective, strong but sweet.  It is my favorite of the entire Calvin Klein collection, with Eternity a close second, and I buy it every chance I get whenever I'm going perfume shopping.  

I highly recommend it - well worth your money and a fabulous scent to be wearing.

gives you a natural, sensuous pout as opposed to thick layer of color (which some lipsticks require) that can only make your face look sharp. not a good (smart) sharp, but opposite of sweet and feminine sort of sharp.
tastes and smells nice too :)

Mania should definately be one of your "Eau de Toilette" spray. It is definately strong and manly - not to be worn to the office. It is a great evening , romantic, or weekend spray to share with those around you! I would recommend trying it first  since everyone chemistry and tastes are different so give it a spray  the next opportunity you walk by a department counter

When I tried a sample of the shampoo and conditioner I had no idea that the next time I went to wash my hair, it would feel completely different. I had my hair up in a bun (I had put it up to workout) and when I let down my hair after it was dry it felt so much thicker and almost like I had more hair.

I was not quite sure why, but then I read about the strengthening effects of this shampoo and conditioner. My hair also felt so much cleaner and silky as if there was no build up and I had washed my hair in mountain spring water.

Ingredients in Shampoo: Water, Rice Bran, Rice Oil, Coconut Oil, Seaweed, Ginseng, Aloe, Wheat Powder, Swertia Herb.
Ingredients in Conditioner: Water, Rice Bran, Rice Oil, Coconut Oil, Seaweed, Ginseng, Aloe, Wheat Powder, Swertia Herb, Natural Vitamin E.

Since this product is relatively expensive, I may have to alternate it with other shampoos and conditioners, but it definitely works. The shampoo doesn't strip the hair the way other harsh shampoos do and I'm very impressed with the natural ingredients cleaning my hair so well. If you have fine or oily hair you may be especially impressed. You also only have to shampoo once, which saves time.

Results after one use:

Smoother Texture
Stronger Hair
Cleaner Hair
More Body - especially if you have fine hair

Looking forward to trying other products with rice bran. You can order a week's supply of this product to try. I think you will fall in love with the shampoo and conditioner.

I have fine hair, a little dry but not too bad.  Have always controlled it with gel.  Try the conditioner - it thickened and settled my hair with one use.  I'm hooked

I have trouble to remember to put on sunscreen in summer on my face, and I don't think the moisturizers that purport to have sunscreen last all day. The Shiseido compact is a powder that can be used wet or dry and it has a lot of sunscreening power. It has a physical block and blocks UVA and UVB.

It's not easy to find a match (mine is darker than I typically use in liquid) but it goes on fairly sheer if you want to apply it dry. The compact itself is a very pretty beachy dark aqua and has a compartment for a sponge to use wet or dry. The refill means you get plenty of use from the compact. I really use this a lot in summer and find it's easy to carry and reapply for maximum sun protection

I have had dark circles since I was young. As I got older (Im 38 now) it seemed to get darker. I am a makeup artist by profession, so believe me when I say that I have tried all kinds of concealers. Some went on smooth but the coverage didnot last and by mid-day there were those dark circles again. I literally had to carry concealer with me because I had to reapply atleast 3 times a day. The heavier concealers worked when I put them on but after awhile it would cake under my eyes, dry out and make my lines more visible and really made me look older! I was hesitant about Hylexin, like everyone, because of the price. I started using it but didnt see any results after few days. I guess it didnt help that I was constantly looking in the mirror.I started to get disappointed but kept on using it. I swear by the 3rd-4th week I could actually see a difference! My circles were way lighter and less noticeable! I dont have "bags" or puffiness, just dark circles and I have olive skin. As I continue to use it, it seems to be getter better and better. It might not take it away completely, but it sure has faded enough that I can now use a concealer (or just a fuller coverage foundation!) and not have to worry about it fading or caking. I feel bad that some people may not have gotten the results that they hoped for, but what do you have to loose! Yeah $95 is alot, but its cheaper and not as invasive as surgery. And it has the same 50/50 chance as cosmetic procedures. Everyones skin is different and reacts differently like any other skincare/cosmetics product. Also, you need to follow the instructions exactly! I applied twice a day and didnot skip any application. I tried very hard to stay out of the sun and used my same skincare routine. I will post another review in a few weeks and see if the circles improved anymore.  I hope this review has helped

I have had dark circles for many, many years.  They did not totally go away after using Hylexin, but they faded a great deal.  I am very fair so this might work better on people with fair skin, as several of the negative reviewers seem to have had darker skin.  BEST RESULTS were on the puffiness under my eyes, which had gotten much worse since I got a little older.  The skin under my eyes no longer sags at all, and superficial wrinkles are definitely minimized.  I feel like I look a lot better after using the product for several months.  I started out with a half-size product from a combo trial pack, and I liked it so much that I've bought the full size product now.  It last forever, so it's really not that expensive over time.  I think it's worth a try for people with similar problems to mine.  I guess everyone's different, but I've been quite happy with the product

I have had dark circles my whole life.  I have bought and tried every type of concealer that is on the market. I get enough sleep, eat fairly decent and drink tons of water and I still have dark circles.  I read about Hylexin in a few magazines so I thought I would give it a try. I bought it thinking if it works great, if not, oh well.  So, I bought Hylexin at a department store about three months ago. After the first two weeks I didn't see any change. I kept using it and after four weeks, I could see a visible change.   I am still using it and I swear it keeps getting better.  It's expensive but it works. I would recommend Hylexin to any one with dark circles.

After first application you can notice reduction in pore size. After 6 months of use I am very satisfied with this products (all Shiseido Pureness line). Apply as instructed by beauty consultant or packaging - should be used as last "cream" before makeup application. Avoid eye area and mouth.

HI
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
I have used Avon ANEW RETROACTIVE+ 2-in-1 Cleanser for months now, and I really like it.  Haven't had any recent breakouts and I love that this product really gets your skin clean.  I only use this product in the moring (I use something different at night) but plan to switch to morning use once my night product runs out.    

Though a little expensive for what you get, still an overall good product.  I will be switching to the individual AVON cleanser and AVON toner, only because I've read that using a 2-in-1 cleanser/toner is not as effective as using them seperately.  Besides, the Avon ANEW RETROACTIVE+ 2-in-1 Cleanser cost $12.00 for 4.2 oz, where the cleanser and toner by themselves cost $12.00 each but you are getting 5.1 oz.  So you are getting more for your money if you buy them seperately

Although its a bit more pricey than other cleansers, this product really helped clear my acne, oily face, and prevented further skin blemishes such as signs of aging on me, as well as my boyfriend's face. What's also great is that it seemed to tightened our face up, but not so much where it had a drying effect. We have tried everything from Neutrogena to Clinique and this product has been effective for us. I would be happy to recommend this product to anyone who has the same problems

I bought this stuff after reading all the great reviews.  My hair was 4b and very thick.  I hadn't had a perm in almost a year and a half.  I put it in myself and followed the directions exactly.  In the past, I've had really bad problems with relaxers burning my scalp to the point I've had scabs all over my head.  That's another reason why I tried this product.  It did burn, but not NEARLY as bad as other relaxers my stylist has used.  It was extremely manageable and not very uncomfortable.  I only left the product on my hair for the 25 minutes it recommends.    It took something like 12 shampoos for the stuff to neutralize.  My hair turned out curly instead of straight.  Guess I didn't "smooth" well enough.  I would def recommend to have a stylist put it in for you so you get the great results.  My hair looks really great flat ironed, but the true test will come after I've had the perm in for a few weeks.  My hair typically breaks off really bad right around the time that I need a retouch.  I am hoping that doesn't happen w/this product.  That will really let me know if it's worth the 60 bucks

Product came on time.  I bought this a second time for a retouch and I am pleased with the results.  It is pricey but worth it.  i leave it on as long as I want to straighten it to my desire. With this product u have the freedom to do that, it will burn your scalp though, but that is after 40min, if you base it right, which I do.  When ur hair gets wet it doesn't really curl up, it frizzes out a lil, not like when you have a regular perm. Sometimes my hair looks flat though, needs volume.  My hair was really coarse when it was natural, now very straight and healthy

I agree with the person who wrote that it is "by far the most expensive relaxer" I've ever bought but it is worth it. My mum was the one who found it and I'm eternally grateful to her as it worked out fantastic. Thanx Mum :) 

I am used to using various box relaxers from the store (Gentle Treatment, TCB, Dark and Lovely etc) and none of these come close. I have a combination of European/Carribean hair which is thick and coarse and so I need a really good relaxer to make it soft and straight.My hair has never been this straight from a box relaxer and it actually moves! :)

There is none of the usual "burning" sensation that often goes along with most relaxers. Nor is there a strong overwhelming smell that is enough to knock you out.

The quantity of the contents is great aswell. There are very few relaxers that you find with enough Conditioner provided to be used again later on.

It is well worth the price.My personal experience gave Salon results at a slightly cheaper price yet more expensive than those sold at Walgreens. I'll stick with the Phytorelaxer.

I am an African-American female with long, thick hair.  I relax and highlight my hair, so imagine the hell I was in when I heard that you should not chemically treat your hair when you are pregnant.  I tried to go along with that, however after 8 weeks I was in dire need of something.  I searched the web for a safe product and found this relaxer.  After rinsing it out and using the phyto shampoo and conditioner I was horrified with the fact that my hair felt like straw.  I rewashed it with Keracare shampoo and conditioner and it felt normal again.  The phyto relaxer did the same thing as a cheap drugstore relaxer, however it has a pleasant scent and doesn't burn your scalp.  After doing 2 or 3 relaxers myself I started to notice breakage.  But I assumed that it was from being pregnant.  I stopped doing my own relaxers when my belly started to weigh me down entirely too much.  I called Phyto and they gave me a listing of salons that use the relaxer on clients.  The salon I went to explained to me that I didn't understand placement when it comes to relaxer.  I was pretty much overlapping the product onto previously relaxed hair.  The instructions say not to do it, but it is really hard to control that.  I continued going to the salon for the relaxers and my hair grew back.  
Now a year later, I continue to use the salon and the product.  I am breastfeeding my son, so I stay away from the chemicals still.  I suggest this relaxer to all of my pregnant friends that don't want to walk around with crazy hair.  I mean pregnancy makes you feel bad enough

I'm 28 and have always had what I would call average skin, the kind that most women have. I have normal skin with a little more oiliness in the T-Zone and I get blackheads and the occasional breakout. I have tried all kinds of different product lines (Urban Defense, DDF, Dior, Philosphy, Bliss, etc.) and am the happiest with the results I get from Murad. 
I can't review just one product because I think the combination is what gives me such great results. I have been using Murad for about 2 1/2 years now so I have tried a lot of the Murad products and found a routine that works great for me. 

In the morning I use the AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser (love it! the gritiness gives you very smooth surface for applying makeup) then the Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel and the Skin Perfecting Lotion which I mix and apply together so that I don't use as much. Last I put on my Moisture Silk Eye Gel and I'm ready to go.  

At night I use the Clarifying Cleanser followed by the Clarifying Toner, the Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel, the Perfecting Lotion and the best product of all the Night Reform Treatment (see my review of that product for details, I love it!) and again I use the Moisture Silk Eye Gel. 

Once a week I throw in the Exfoliating Fruit Enzyme Mask and I have perfect skin if I stick to the program everyday. My skin looks and feels better than it ever has and people always guess my age to be around 23 so it must be doing something right! 

Top 5 Favorite Murad Products:
1. Soothing Lip Therapy
2. Night Reform Treatment
3. Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel
4. AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser
5. Clarifying Cleanser

Murad Products that I don't like:
1. Day Reform Treatment (too greasy and I hate the smell)
2. Purifying Face Scrub 
3. The products for combination skin - they are ok but the acne line is so mild that people with combination skin will see better results using it. (I have used both product lines)

This is a nice eye cream but it is way to expensive!   I wish it were 20 bucks instead of 50 bucks but then again Murad products are very high quality.  I only have been using this eye cream for a month and I do notice that is makes my eye area very mosturized.  I am sure if I use this for a long time I will see more benefits....so yeah this is a good qaulity product.  I will continue to use it...but I am not sure if I will rebuy because it is so expensive

I highly reccomend this kit. I am an esthetician that has lots of trouble with hormonal breakouts on my chin, jawline and neck. I had been using a system with benzoyl peroxide that was just too drying, even though I do have an oily skin type. This kit is great. All of the products are full size (except the samples of the peels). The products are very concentrated, so I expect that this kit will last around 3 months. I noticed an immediate difference in my skin - brighter, firmer, healthier glow. I've now been using it for two weeks. I've had a few hormonal breakouts (right before my period) but they are very small and clear up much faster. It is really getting rid of  red scarring left over from previous breakouts and my fine lines around my eyes are certainly decreasing too. The sample peels in the kit are awesome. You can get 2 peels out of each sample set - so about a total of 6 treatments. I reccomend using the peels 2X week to get you started - it really kicks up the results

It wasn't really big enough for the morning coverage with the face color, but it is a wonderful touch-up brush to use for your compact.  I have mixed some warmth, pink gossimer, tinted mineral vail in my compact and it is good refresher late in the afternoon or before meeting coworkers afterhours

I purchased this mask on the recommendation of a friend, who loves it. I've been using the mask two or three times a week for the past month - it leaves my skin hydrated and rosy. While it doesn't purport itself as an acne treatment, my skin overall looks much brighter and heathier. It also makes my face tingle pleasantly. 

I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a skin pick-me-up! It is worth the investment.

This product I use after I wash my face, I leave on for the instructed five minutes, then I rinse then apply my night gel (any product cream), However, I have been using this for the past three weeks, and I have already been told by friends that my face looks great, and what have i been doing different..  So with this I give this product a thumbs UP!!

Scent is my favorite self-indulgence. The way I figure it is that I may not be able to afford the finest clothes, the finest handbags, or the finest cars, but I can certainly afford the finest scents, and this is one of them. I first encountered Kai on a visit to L.A. Actually, I bought it in a flower shop. You know that fabulous smell that hits you when you walk into a high-end florist, the one that makes you feel as if you are instantly on vacation? That's Kai. I own the perfume and the body lotion. The perfume oil in particular is a very small size, but a little goes a long way. I get compliments every time I wear it. You deserve it, too

I've never done a review online for a product-but I can't rave enough about Khoret Amen Hair Oil.  I've been using that along with the Healthy Hair Butter with my relaxed hair and it's fabulous! It's great for moisturizing your scalp and ends (just use a little dab though-it is oil so don't over do it!). Plus, my hubby really, really likes the scent

I like everything in this set.  I have colored treated, oily hair so I was kind of concerned that this wouldn't work for me, but it does! I just don't use too much if it. I have been washing my hair with the Shine and protect shampoo and conditioner twice a week (I washed my hair everyday, but I can't wash it everyday with Ojon because it would be too heavy). My hair looks longer since I have been using this product and it seems healthier and shinier. it smells sort like gum or push-ups. I will definitely be buying full sizes of these when I run out. The leave in glossing cream I used every time I wash my hair. The tube size is 2 oz (the same as the shampoo and conditioner) but, it takes so little for my hair that I think it will last six to eight months and it really does work. This is probably the best glossing cream ever (certainly for oily hair)- it's better than Kiehls and Frederic Fekkai and they are both really good. I also use the  shine and protect glossing mist when I "do" my hair (straightening iron or rollers). It works well and makes my hair glossy not greasy and stringy. The last product is the Restorative hair treatment I have used it once and it's conditioning and trufully it does smell strongly (like baby oil and dirt? coffee grounds? ashes?) But, I really didn't notice that the smell lingered after I washed my hair and I think if used it on dry hair you would have really good results

A little pricey, but well worth it.  Gives me a charge in the morning and really wakes me up!  Makes you feel cool and tingly all over and I find that I just want to keep on scrubbing!!!  Great product for the summer, b/c the cool feeling you get even lasts for a while after you get out of the shower.  Also, it seems to be concentrated so you don't need a lot of it.  Would have liked it even more if it were a little more moisturizing.  If not for that, and the price, I would have given it a "perfect 5" score

Ok, we all have to shampoo and we've all tried hundreds of products.  This one by Aveda is heavenly. The scent is almost as sweet and fresh as a brand new baby - you know, ladies.  It's bliss.  You just close your eyes and inhale the loveliness of it. Plus, it cleans hair well, leaving it soft and fresh, full.

The shampoo is bliss. Find it, buy it, use it.
At least try it once. An upforgettable experience in the shower

I love, love this shampoo. This lathers up nice and cleans your hair without leaving it stripped and dry.  I also use the Shampure Conditioner with this too.  The scent in this shampoo is heavenly! I have used this shampoo for years and will keep buying it. If you have not tried it you must, and can buy a sample size to try it out.  You will not be disappointed.

I give this product 4.5 stars. I have long wavy/straight hair. It gets really frizzy in humid weather and I used to use John Frieda serum, and that worked well for me. The bottle was just really small and I would run out fast because of my long hair. I decided to buy this product. It has a thinner consistency than John Frieda's serum but it works just as well. It does make my hair soft and it tames the flyaways, but I would not use this product alone in my hair. I usually put a little of this on before I blowdry, a little afterwards and then I put Bed Head's after party in my hair before I straight iron my hair. Both the bed head and Biosilk really sink into my hair and gets absorbed and never looks greasy. After I do that, my hair is super soft. 
I like that the bottle is a good size considering you only need like a dime sized amount but I think it is a little pricey. But considering how long it will last, I think it is worth it. I would never use this on my skin (It says you can use this on your skin) just because I would feel like I am putting oil or something on my skin. And it also smells a little like hair spray, but it is not overpowering. Once you put it in your hair, you cannot smell it. All in all, a great product.

Smells great, detangles wonderfully and conditions well without a heavy product build-up feel.  I typically use Silk Therapy closer to my relaxer salon appointment as my roots grow in and my hair tangles more easily.  I run a quarter sized amount through recently washed/conditioned towel dried hair and it detangles everything -- much less breakage as a result.  Excellent as a secondary conditioner and detangler

What can I say, I also have long tight curls and I got so frustrated with the frizz in the humidity that I went back to BioSilk Therapy again.  I trimmed my hair and instead of letting it go curly I decided to straighten it and put a soft curl in with curling iron.  The BioSilk Therapy makes my hair baby soft and protects it from flat irons and curling irons.  Its like I have a totally different head of hair.  This is the best thing out there for curly hair and believe me I tried a lot

Biosilk is with out a doubt the best product on the market for your hair! I have used it for a few years now, and my hair is in the best condition it has probley ever been in. I have very thick, curly hair that I regularly straighten with a CHI hot iron and color treat, so my hair is rather prone to damage. Before I used this product, my hair was FRIED! It was dry, crispy, and always smelled burnt from straighting it. It was pretty bad. When I went to get my hair cut, the hair dresser made a comment on how badly damaged my hair was. I told her it was from straighting and coloring my hair, and she told my about Biosilk. I little bottle came with the CHI I bought, but I had never bothered to use it. She told me to apply a little bit of it before the next time I straighten my hair to see if it helped. After my first use, my hair was noticably softer, shinier, and less frizzy. So, i continued to use it. It worked even better after I used it for while. It improved the overall condition of my hair, and has made it so much more managable. Another great thing about Biosilk is the subsatnce of it. It has thick, watery like, smooth feel to it. I use about a quarter-sized amount after a shower on wet hair, and right before I style on dry hair. It is so light weight, I can't even tell I have anything in my hair. Because I don't have to use very much, a bottle lasts me for several months. Sure its a little expensive, but it is defenitly worth it! I recommend it to anybody with troublsome hair, or anybody who just wants great-looking hair. I promise, you will love it!!!!!!

If I was given a choice of any other mascara for free I wouldn't take it. If I was forced to choose just one item of make-up (God forbid!) I would take this mascara. I experiment with other beauty products but am totally loyal to Defincils. It goes on perfectly from root to tip, separates and makes lashes look long, long, long. It doesn't clump or flake. The name is appropriate because it really does define and that gives the eyes a beautiful open appearance. Lancome is known for making the best mascara and the reputation is well deserved. And if you really want dramatically flutterable lashes try putting on Lancomes base                                    coat which makes lashes fuller too and lengthens. Since I have given other products five stars I wish I could give this six. It's THE best thing in my make-up arsenal

I have tried tons of other scents, around 20 and I hadn't quite found anything that really fit me yet. So nice when you first spray it, the extreme has like a gin or juniper scent, real manly and real clean but not at all like aftershave. After about fifteen twenty minutes it gets real polite like a clean vanilla but not at all like a flower. It smells soft and super wafty almost like a less sweet Burberry but not at all like baby powder. 
   floaty non intrusive and not too sweet. If you hate the strong aftershave smell and the cotton candy machine smell as much as I do or you find yourself spraying cologne on more than once a day then this is your best bet.

don't buy it here you can get it on the cheap off ebay

I have been getting irritated skin / razor bumps / ingrown hairs (the whole nine yards) ever since I started shaving.  I've tried different cartridges, different methods of shaving, and even a cutthroat razor (had to give that up right away -- much too much maintenance).  However, with the purchase of this Merkur HD safety razor, I've finally found a product that I can stick with.  People say it takes some getting used to, but I found it not the slightest bit more difficult than shaving with a cartridge razor.  I get the closest shaves ever with it, with practically no irritation.  Other pluses include blades that last nearly a week and only cost 50 cents a piece!!  With cartridges costing up to three dollars, it's time to go old school (especially since I'm a poor college student).

I can't compare this model to other safety razors, but I can say that it is a great intro safety razor.  Good weight, and simple to use.  I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone fed up with the cost of cartridges, and looking for a simple, effective solution

All I have to say is wow.  I'm 24.  My first razor was the same kind of DE razor that my dad used (some Gillette).  Around 17 the mach 3 came out and since the full knowledge of shaving was never really handed down to me, I opted for the mach 3 which was easy to use and gave a decent shave.  I've essentially stuck with the Mach 3 until now, but being generally unsatisfied with the closeness of my shave I decided to investigate and turned back to the safety razor picking up this Merkur HD.  I just used it for the first time and it turned out to be significantly more satisfying than I had hoped it would be.  I nicked myself a few times without really noticing so there's some learning curve but as of now I've only used it once and I can tell you that it won't take long to get it down. 

A couple thoughts:
1) I'm really glad that I went for an HD.  I thought the HD may be heavy (and it may be compared to other DE razors) but I wouldn't want it to be any lighter.  It already feels light in my hand.

2) The biggest thing to keep in mind about the shave is that the razor cuts by keeping it perpendicular to your skin.  The most notable difference between shaving with the Mach 3 v. the Merkur HD centered around this.  With the Mach 3 I kind of feel like I have to drag the blade across my skin (kind of scraping it) to get a close shave (which can be done and I don't notice that much irritation).  That said most of the shave with the HD was as close, but since the aim is to keep the blade perpendicular, the razor felt more like it was gliding over the skin. Very nice.

3) To put in a new blade you unscrew the bottom and the top part comes off.  You pop in the blade, put the top back on and screw the bottom to tighten the top.  

It should be noted that I've started shaving at night so that I can tell what I'm doing (I'm not a morning person) so in the morning if I'm not really going to pay attention the Mach 3 may still be better.  Also, I'm using cheap soap and a boar brush from CVS until the stuff I ordered comes in so with any luck it will be even nicer next time

I recently took the plunge back to DE razors with this one.  I have since picked up some old Gillette's on eBay.  I've been thinking I might as well have stopped with this razor.  It produces a nice close shave and I don't seem to create as many nicks and cuts when using it

This is the ideal razor to start shaving with if learning to use a double edge safety razor.
There are no adjustments to cause confusion, a non-slip grip with indentations, well balanced, quality, and well priced.
   One can always upgrade to a Merkur Futur, Vision, or the Progress models if one wants an adjustable razor. This is my favorite one &amp; the Futur is 2nd. Happy Shaving

I had a Merkur Razor that I bought one year ago. I dropped it in the locker room at the gym and it chipped. So I kept it as a spare, but the new one (Merkur Heavy Duty Safety Razor) is the best! I should have bought this one to begin with. It makes shaving a pleasure! I enjoy shaving everyday! It helps start my day, by looking my best!!

In the world of shampoo's I must have tried
every one of them and spent much money, each
time hoping I would see the results that were
promised. Then I found this product.   My hair
responded immediately.   It is now looking
better than it has in years.   I am not a
young woman any more, but still take pride in
myself.   I have to say this is simply the best
shampoo product on the market today - bar none.

Although expensive, this product produces results while the other cheaper ones I've tried simply do not.  Every now and then I get a few zits which don't bother me really.  What bothers me is the dark spot that lasts months after the pimple is gone.  The oxygen peel drastically reduces the blotchiness and hyperpigmentation.  As soon as I rinse the stuff off my face I'm always amazed to look in the mirror and see the results.  This stuff does help keep your pores clean also.  I would recommend using this product every couple of weeks and DEFINATELY before a big event (pictures etc).  Basically you put a gel over your face and then add a hydrogen peroxide cream, the whole thing foams up, you wait 1-3 minutes (intense tingling experienced at times) and then rinse.  Some people say to 1/2 the amount recommended so the product last longer but I didn't really find it was worth it.

I have been using the Philosophy products for over a year now and it has made an amazing difference on my skin. I love this peel kit. I do admit it feels funny the first couple of times because the first layer is a jelly like substance, and then when the cream "activates" and starts foaming it takes some getting used to. BUT, it is so worth it in the end. I use it once a month and you can tell a difference with the very first use. I use the purity cleanser every day along with the hope in a jar cream. These are the best products ever. Oh and before I forget, the Falling in Love fragrence is my absolute favorite, and the Pure Grace is a very clean smell. Can you tell I am a Philosophy Girl?

This is an amazing product.  It is gentle on the skin, and I have very sensitive skin, yet removes the tired, dead, and darkening follicles.  I can't believe how much lighter and younger my skin looks after a peel.  It smells nice and doesn't cause any itching or burning, on my skin at least.  This is a must to use before big days like weddings or fabulous dates, or when getting back from a grubby camping trip.  One thing, a day after the peel my skin looks a little red/blotchy in places but the day after that it's stunning so if you are indeed purchasing this for a wedding, etc. use it 2 days before the big day or else you might look like a splotchy bride.

Most of Philosophy's products are fabulous and if you're going to go for this, it works well with the Real Purity facial cleanser to use right after the peel, and then the Hope in a Jar moisturizer after that.

This soap is awesome. What I like about it is that it doesn't have a sweet scent to it. In fact, you really have to sniff it to smell it. It leaves your hands feeling super clean and hydrated, as if you just put on a light lotion (but without the feeling of having something "on" your hands). What I do not like about this soap is that it leaves a reddish-brown film after you use it. I had to buy a special soap holder (one that has little "pillars" to hold the soap up so that it doesn't touch the surface) so it wouldn't make a mess. I really like this soap, though. It's winter, and I like anything that will keep my hands smooth and soft without having to use lotion

Exotic, enticing, and enriching all rolled into one.  As the last reviewer said, this one will have you envisioning something wild and sexy.

Too me its a mixture of so many things that it drives you absolutely WILD.  That's why I really love I love to put this 
on when I go out at night.

This scent contains a blend of: a fresh floral, including honeysuckle, gardenia and iris, with notes of amber and vanilla.

I've worn Caleche for 30 years, since a sales person in a parfumerie near the Paris opera introduced it to me in college.  It works year-round &amp; it's not heavy so you don't annoy everyone within 50 feet.  Instead, it lingers just enough.  The parfum formula is great, but this soie de parfum is perfect for work, and it's cheaper.  This is a great price from Amazon and I'm glad to see them offer it...I've had to wait till international travel to get the best buys in the duty-free stores, and it's much easier to use the web

I have naturally VERY curly and fine hair. Due to having fine hair I have the unfortunate circumstance that I do not have weight to my hair to pull the curl down, therefore I blow dry it straight every other day. For about 10 yrs now I have used the Phyto defrisant balm which is fantastic because you never feel that your hair has product in it, but it smooths it out. So I decided to buy their shampoo for similar purpose. It is excellent. It is another product that tames the hair but it moves naturally and it never feels like there is product left in the hair. Definitely a great product and paired with the defrisant balm is excellent for blow drying

I had long straight all one length hair, the kind of hair people wish they had. Then I gave birth to the love of my life and my hair went to S**T!! It went frizzy, for 8 years I tried expensive, cheap anything (so, I thought) that said would help frizzy hair. Then I heard of Phyto, Yepee!! Between PhytoBrush and Defrisant, I have my hair back. IT'S NOT FRIZZY ANYMORE. If you are anything like me, on a budget and really can't afford it. Save up. You only have to use a little to help. And the peace of mind it gives you (your sanity back)no more bad hair days. Is worth the price by far. I'll never go back. PLEASE try it. Love your hair again

I have very sensitive skin. I have tried so many face creams, if they did anything else but strictly moisturize (i.e. anti aging, etc.), my skin would break out in a rash. My daughter had given me an "anti stress" cream mask she brought from Germany.  My skin looked so much better!  One ingredient was green tea. So I searched for creams with green tea and found this one.  This cream is the answer to all those women with super sensitive skin. It actually improves my skin tone. The price is great too

I have sensitive skin and mild rosacea and have tried many so-called "calming" moisturizers, even some supposedly medically formulated ones.  This is the first moisturizer that really does seem to calm my skin, and feels soothing when applied.  Maybe it's the green tea.  It also does improve the look of my skin.  I'd be sorry if they ever discontinued this prouct - I rely on it

I tried this scent ten years ago after reading that it was Mary Tyler Moore's favorite, and it soon became mine.  Lightly feminine and sensual, it always garners compliments when I wear it.   Strangers (men and women alike) have told me how much they enjoyed the scent and asked what I was wearing.  I also carry the compressed powder compact in my purse.  It's got a slightly more "powdery" (appropriate, I suppose) note and is a wonderful way to carry the scent with you.  It will always be a staple for me

This has been one of my favorites since its introduction in 1994.  This fragrance is on the light side.  I wear it in the summer.  The undertones of this scent are definitely floral but with a good bit of spice in the background.

I love this perfume and receive compliments on it from both men and woman.  I have had people at work ask me to right down the name of this one so that they could buy it for themselves or their wife.  

This perfume is a winner.  I highly recommend this scent.  Give it a whiff the next time you are out perfume shopping. I don't think that you will be disappointed

Beyond Paradise was my Christmas gift from a dear friend and I was really surprised how well she pinpointed a perfume that is not only totally gorgeous but one that works so well with the chemistry of my skin. The fragrance is a prismatic rainbow of juicy fruits and florals, heavily laden with succulent honeysuckle and musky base. I love the lasting power of the fragrant aura that envelops me the second I pray it on and the bottle looks absolutely breathtaking on my dresser. The scent itself is heady and aromatic, more floral and sophisticated than most tropical fragrance; I don't smell bananas and coconut here but soft orchid, pulpy woods, juicy plum and soft dewy honeysuckle with its sparkling golden nectar.

This is one of my favorite perfumes now, something I reach for very often and something that puts a smile on my face whenever I get a whiff of it. One a rainy and gray monday morning I feel that I can carry a layer of ambrosial paradise that sets on me like a soft cloud of euphoric proportions as it nestles itself into my skin and exudes a shimmery cloud of scent all day long. It's really a rainbow of happiness in a bottle. 

The top notes are Eden's Mist, Blue Hyacinth, Orange Flower Templar, Jabuticaba Fruit.
Middle notes are Laelia Orchid, Crepe Jasmin, Mahonia Japonica, Pink Honeysuckle balanced over a base of Natal Plum Blossoms, Ambrette Seed, Zebrano Wood, Golden Melaleuca Bark for a sweet and fruity concoction.

I am one to always try new oils and creams that claim to be the best for nails and hands. Well let me tell you, this stuff is truly the best product that I have ever used for nails and cuticles. Solar Oil is meant for use on natural and fake nails. You should rub it on your nails and cuticles each night at bedtime. It soothes and moisturizes your nails and keeps them from being brittle and cracking. Awesome stuff...a must for anyone who wants their nails to look attractive...the price is right too

I purchased The Concentrate a year ago when I had a rhinoplasty, and put it on the incision line after the stitches came out.  Now, there isn't scar!  It is also suitable for the most sensitive skin, which I have. The Creme slightly aggrivated my skin and the Concentrate did not.  It may cost more than the Creme, but it lasts about five months when used in moderation.  I recommend it it anyone who wants scarless skin post-surgery

I purchased these at my local Sephora.  They are pretty easy to apply (much easier than I imagined) and they don't bat off like I thought they would.  I'm happy with this purchase and would purchase them again.  Wearing them to Teddy's last week I got a ton of compliments on the pink.  And for $15, you get four complete sets in white, black, pink and blue so this will last

Well I got my bottle of Curve today along with another couple of colognes on the "So you'd like to...start wearing cologne" guide on amazon that I have been purchasing by. With all my newfound knowledge about cologne history, perspective, and opinions, I used these colognes to give an informative speech this evening in my public speaking course, complete with all the bottles present. I sprayed CURVE onto myself when it arrived, and now I am comparing all of the new scents to my favorites so far, HUGO and CANDIES. My impression was that it was more serious than Hugo, had a sweetish overtone combined with musk, and then there was sort of a greenish bitter forest type scent to it that I wasn't crazy about. I think I may have been dissappointed at first, but that soon changed. After about fifteen minutes the smell got to be really good and the elements I hadn't liked were gone or had matured into subtle forms that went well together. 
After the speech I allowed the class to sample all of the colognes, and Curve was commented on the most, followed by Drakkar, then Hugo. All of the women liked it and seemed to have great associations with it, and for that I have to ensure that it gets the full 5 stars. I continue to wear it now later this same evening and it has quite grown on me. 
If you only bought Curve as your main cologne, you'd be quite alright. Subtle enough for casual wear and bright enough for clubbing. Overall good mix

This is a very popular nail polish with color names that are always a play on words or something whimsical. My favorite is "I'm Not Really A Waitress" which is a deep, diva garnet shade and really beautiful. The colors tend to be very rich or very opaque and really wear well. The bottles are pretty

I have struggled with very dry skin and acne all my life and this is the only product I have found that does not make me break out! Also love the fact that it has no scent whatsoever. LOVE it

I am allergic to benzoyl peroxide.  So, there are many products that I can't use for acne.  I tried everything that didn't have benzoyl peroxide in it - even expensive department store brands and beauty brands to clear up my skin.  Murad's Acne System was the only one that worked!  My skin cleared up in a week.  I didn't go through any purging that I could tell.  However, I started using the system right after a professional deep cleansing facial.  It took several months to get completely clear but it worked.  I have been using it for several years now and break out if I forget it when I'm travelling.  I can't live without it!  I recently got a facial on a cruise and the woman couldn't believe that I had problems with breakouts.  I would if I wasn't using my Murad.

I faithfully wash my face in the shower with the cleansing gel every morning.  Once or twice a week I use the AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser that I purchased separately.  I then apply the Acne Treatment Gel after I've dried off.  I follow with the moisturizer in the kit.  I do the same thing at night (except I'm not in the shower).  I almost never need the spot treatment now.  I have several tubes drying up in my cabinet.  I bought the mask separately too and used it a lot in the beginning but now I think the tube has dried up.  I haven't needed it in over a year.  I also used the vitamin supplements in the beginning.  However, since I do take vitamins anyway, I didn't really notice that they made a difference.  I also get a facial by a professional once and awhile to give my skin a boost.  However, since they are $$$ I tend to only get 2 or 3 a year.  Last year I only had one and my skin looked great.

Mistral, as many know, is a powerful, gusty wind that blows across the south of France. Mistral, as I was happy to discover, is also the name of a line of bath and body products, all French inspired, all lusciously lovely from scented soaps to soothing lotions to rejuvenating body butters. 

Matthew Tilker, founder and president of Mistral, utilizes Shea butter, which is an efficacious natural healer, in a myriad of must-have forms. Derived from the nuts of the African Shea Tree (according to sacred custom the nuts are harvested primarily by women), this butter is highly emollient, a boon for those with dry skin, chapped lips, any number of skin irritations. 

The pure Shea Butter soap comes in a plethora of inviting fragrances, all milled six times (while others boast being triple milled). South Seas is a particular favorite - it's as fresh as an ocean breeze and as calming, soothing as a tropical island. The marine scent is accented with a touch of grapefruit, white flowers and soft woods. An irresistible combination. 

South Seas is a fragrance with which you wish to surround yourself - made possible by the shower gel, body lotion, massage bath and body oil, bath salts and candle all available at very accessible prices.

Buffy makes me so happy, I hate to shower without it.  I have extremely dry and sensitive skin and I'm prone to icky scaly patches, especially in winter.  Buffy smooths them away with the scrubby bits, then moisturizes with the butters and oils.  It's worth the money -- even with regular use, the bar lasts a long time.

My favorite thing about Buffy... it's awesome exfoliating properties!  I live in Hawaii, and the salt water and sun can take a beating to your skin, so I love this product!  It does an awesome job of exfoliating away dead and dry skin, and the essential oils in the bar give my skin it's moisture back.  Though like mentioned in other reviews, the almond pieces may be too rough for sensitive skin, and I wouldn't recommend this for daily use for anyone who has oily skin.  Once a week should be great.

The only thing I didn't care was the fact that Buffy did leave a slight coat of oil on my skin, and unless I was taking a really hot shower, my shower/tub floor was left feeling slick also.  I usually have to rinse again quickly with my soap, but this bar is a really nice skin conditioner for once-a-week treatments. I like to save the bar and use it when I have some time to relax for a while in the tub.  That way I'll do the bar right when I get in, and just let the essential oils absorb into my skin. I love it!

Still highly recommended

Buffy is my favorite Lush product ... and I know I'm not alone in this! Anything that saves me steps in the morning is a wonderful thing, and I love the idea that it's exfoliating and moisturizing in one. It's actually really difficult to describe the Buffy experience, but if you try this one, I'm sure you'll be hooked like me. The scent is yummy and unlike previous reviewers, I find that it lasts for a long time (although like all Lush products, you don't want to leave them sitting in the shower or tub - let them dry out after each use). I use Buffy on my legs in between shaving days, and I do an all over body scrub about once every week or two. Doing this, the small bar lasts about a month. I love that it's such a strong exfoliator, but someone with sensitive skin may need to go easy with Buffy

Okay, so I'm a lotions and potions person. And, I suffer from severe dry skin. You know, the dry bumps all over your arms, and itchy patches on legs sort of dryness. A dermatologist called it extreme keratosis pilaris, and told me to use something like Amlactin. 
So I used that stuff and it worked, but the smell and texture was dreadful. So over the years I've tested and tried multiple other things. And it's worked, but all left my skin kinda sticky, and not moisturized enough.

Then,.....I found this little miracle bar. It took care of all my skin issues, plus it felt good, plus is smelled good. And I have wonderful skin! AND (big and, because I have 2 small kids and no time)it eliminated 1 step from my shower routine (the lotion step). Seriously, you don't need lotion after this, as a matter of fact, worst case, I can go 2 days without moisturizing (2 small kids, lack of time again), and my skin still feels great.

I love, love, love this stuff

I get complimented by dates for having soft skin and this is the secret. I combine it w/ Nivea Q10 lotion, which is non-greasy and the combination leaves my skin ultra-soft. 

A tip in using this is to cut it up into little squares before you use it. Each little square will be 1-2 uses. If you get the biggest size, you should cut it into slabs first, then make squares out of those. It's expensive, but it'll last for quite a while if you do this

I bought this for my girlfriend.  She had told me about it after Christmas, when she smelled it from a strip in a magazine.  I told her I would get it for her.  I had purchased the larger, 100 ml, and she absolutely loves it.  She has been showered many times with gifts and this was a special one.  I was not going to let her down.  It's not the gift but the love behind it that counts

I've been eyeing this on the fantasybritneyspears.com website &amp; counting down the days until my holiday to New York - the fact that it's Britney made me wanted it!

Was I disappointed after my wait? Not at all, I bought the 100ml bottle.

I admit I was a little wary - I suffer from migraines so can't wear a lot of my favourites; including Angel by Thierry Mugler. Not so with FANTASY. 

This opens with the sweetness of chocolate and cupcake, before settling with fruity scents of lychee, quince and kiwi. The base note of vanilla lingers throughout making FANTASY a truly delicious classic in the making - Angel light!!

I loved the presentation in a little black bag with a red string. When you open the silver tin, there's an almond on top of the body butter (which I didn't dare to eat). I love the smell of this product and that's why I gave this 4 stars! The only thing is that it's too greasy for my taste. I can't open doors afterwards or pull a cap off of my chapstick.

If you enjoy a strong, fresh scent, then Demon is for you...this is one of my favorite soaps by Lush and a repeat buy.  It is fun to look at, smell, and use in the shower or bath and it does what I have come to expect from Lush products- it makes getting clean a lot more fun!  This soap is not just for men, but for women, too!  I also love the way the ingredients in these soaps make my skin feel after the shower...

A word of advice: Lush soaps may foam very little in certain types of water...in this case I recommend a bath puff or some other type of sponge to work up a nice lather

I love this soap, it smells great and makes my skin soft. 
I only peeled off the wax on one side (I didn't find it difficult), and I set the soap up on its waxed side, preventing it from melting. I haven't had any problems with using it like this!
The smell is really refreshing. I do wish it stayed around longer after the shower though.
My one major complaint is that it dosn't lather that well

I really like the minty scent of this soap. I think it is best for a guy because it is not very "girly." The soap itself looks great as a decorative guest bathroom soap. 

Despite what others say it says right on the soaps label to "remove black wax before use" I had no problem at all removing it. It was 90 degrees (F) out the day I got the soap so it was kinda soft. After it hardned up a bit the black wax came right off with no problem. I only give it four stars though because the black wax thing is kinda goofy. As much as I get the point of "demon in the dark" the wax goes right in the trash when you get it. I would rather just buy the soap with out the wax on

I bought this for my husband to use after his 4am runs, thinking the mint might start his day off happy and awake.  He loves the smell (and the color).  The nice lady who sold it to us told us to take the wax off, so we didnt have an issue with that.  I used it one morning after I was crazy enough to get up and exercise at 4am and I liked it too.  The scent isnt too strong for girls, and it took all the oily feeling from my post-exercise skin without drying me out

*****
This has been my daily moisturizer for several years. It makes my skin very soft, very healthy looking, and glowing. It makes me look radiant. I have given it as a gift to my sister and to other women, and they have all liked it as much as I have. No one has had any adverse reactions. You can notice a difference after just one use. When I've run out and used something else temporarily, I always can see the difference again once I start back up. It is as close as it gets to a miracle cream.

I do not wear makeup, so Hope In A Jar is it.  I am 49 years old and I think my skin looks incredible.  The friends I have given it to also like to keep a natural look and prefer their skin without heavy creams, thick moisturizers and sunscreens, or makeup. 

The women I know who are fans of Hope In A Jar are like me. We're kind of lazy no-fuss "one cream that does it all" people; instead of one jar of something for one thing, and another for something else---eye creams, night time moisturizers, daytime moisturizers, etc.---we're the type that wants just one that can do the job and then be done with it. In other words, we don't have the patience to fuss with our looks a lot, or to spend money buying bunches of different creams to keep track of and remember to use.

Unlike other reviewers, I love the smell, which is not perfumey, but definitely pleasantly distinctive. I use it around my eyes also, and have not had an allergic reaction.  It seems, though, that these are the two biggest problems with Hope---the distinctive odor and allergic reactions among some people.  I would suggest buying it the first time from somewhere you could return it if you don't care for it; although in my opinion, this would be unlikely, apparently it is possible. Philosophy now makes another version of Hope In A Jar for sensitive skin; if you know that your skin in tempermental, perhaps it would be better to also try this version. I have stuck with Hope In A Jar because it works so well for me. 

It seems expensive, but it is not because it lasts a long, long time.  The two-ounce jar lasts me about six months.  I use a toner and then Hope In A Jar and that's it.  I'm done with my face in 30 seconds. Plus, it gives me a look that most women use makeup to get, so I think it's a bargain.

As a reviewer in my mid-forties, I have gone through many brands of moisturizer in the last few years looking for something that worked well for my "normal" but sometimes stressed skin.  After spending a small fortune on skincare products, I have finally found a product I can count on.  Hope in a Jar leaves my skin with a clean yet moisturized feeling, and is a perfect base for foundation, as it is not greasy or oily.  And, as an added bonus, the price seems reasonable for something that lasts so long.  It is necessary to use a good eye cream as well, as this product is not meant for the eye area, and can be slightly irritating.  Overall, I have seen a marked improvement in my skin in the last 3 months since using this product

I admit I have not used a ton of different types of cologne, but out of all of them, Fahrenheit is the greatest. I purchased a small bottle of this stuff about 4 or 5 years ago. I still have some left, I just can't bring myself to finish it off, I think I might have 20 or so sprays left.

Sure it is masculine, but it is not by any means musky. It has a somewhat sweeter scent than average, when it comes to stuff like this geared for a dude. It just smells awesome and thats what counts

These glosses are so beautiful. They coat in the most lucious way and another plus is they don't leave you feeling like you have tar on your lips. Another thing is the colors don't look artificial. So many times does a gloss make you look like a clown if you pick the wrong color. However this just looks awesome. It stays with you for a while too. The only thumbs down is on the taste factor. I expect glosses to be flavorful and these aren't. But with all the grandeur of the product, I can't give it less than 5 stars. A note to buyers: the colors on here aren't the actual colors. Like Sun Bronze is a lot lighter and glistens. Miracle also is a pale shade of sparkling pink. On the bright side every color looks good on everyone so buy buy buy! A little pricy but worth it compared to how long it lasts compared to all the other duds out there.

I get really dry and chapped lips in the winter and this completely fixed them.  It protects from the cold dry weather and it is a good moisturizer even in warm and sunny conditions.  Plus I love the cocoa scent

I just discovered this 3 weeks ago. A woman with perfect skin told me when she first tried it she saw a huge difference. I didn't like the way my skin looked for the first couple days. It felt a little greasy and heavy (and kind of has a bacon grease type scent) but I stuck to it and am now getting compliments on my radiance!
Though that might be partly due to my yoga program!
I like that this helps protect the skin from sun. I use it under skinceuticals spf 20 which I love also

Can't get enough of that smell! I think it should be a 2 in 1, just shampoo &amp; shower gel b/c there's no real conditioning.  Still love it and use if mainly for shower gel and occas shampoo b/c i color my hair.  Doesn't fade dark color

This smells so good. I love the Philosophy line and my favorites are Cinnamon Buns, EggNog and blackberry. Dont use this if you are in a hurry, becuz you will want to linger as long as you can in the shower! The only downfall is the scent does not last for more then a few mins on your skin, but lasts awhile engulfing your bathroom in a yummy cinnamon buns scent

I have a habit of stopping by perfume counters way too often, and have a fair collection to show for it. However, about a year and a half ago I came across Blue. I had done my usual trick of not wearing any perfume to the mall, then stopping by to sample a scent or two, then wander around to do my shopping..this way I can tell what the scent is like on me after a bit of time. Blue had me hooked immediately. It has now become my absolute scent of choice...I have had complete strangers, both men and women literally stop me in the grocery store, at the mall, at work, EVERYWHERE just to ask me what I am wearing. It is light, not overpowering...I am not a fan of the heavy florals, and so this is ideal for me. I personally love it, but the staggering amount of compliments from friends and total strangers alike has confirmed that this perfume is beautiful, light, elegant and fresh, and yet most definitely makes a statement.  I cannot recommend this highly enough...just try it on for the day the next time you go to a department store. I can virtually guarantee  that you will head back to pick some up...it is truly that lovely

This scent is amazing! Ralph Blue has a floral scent, it smells like a exotic bouquet of flowers. It is sexy and fun. I think people of all ages will enjoy this scent. What is neat about this fragrance is that this is a scent that uses surface area, moisture and body heat to achieve its maximum bloom! so all of these factors considered, this scent is going to vary from person to person, so no two are going to smell exactly alike :) Also the blue bottle is gorgeous!

Great for moisturizing dry and rough skin. I live in a humid area, so it's important for me not to have to put a heavy lotion or cream on my skin. This lotion leaves my face feeling good, and not greasy or slimy at all.

This product works wonders over the winter months.  I didn't realize how it prevents dry skin until after I stopped using it for a few days during the winter.  From my experience, this product doesn't leave an oily film on your face or make you shine for hours under the lights.  Unlike other products, I don't feel like a teenager going thru acne again.

The price for the quality is worth it and the amount you need to apply makes the cost per application comparable to other products

This is an amazing product. It is probably the lightest product I have used, providing a lot of moisture but basically leaving no residue and just a soft, matte feel. This line makes really advanced skincare products and the ingredients on this product such as hyluronic acid and alpha/beta hydroxy acids are usually only found on the best skincare lines. I really like the fact that the product has no added fragance and comes in a generous 6oz bottle, when most of the other men's moisturizers come in 2-2.5 oz containers. I will definitively try other products of this line

I love this stuff!  Too bad it is so PRICEY (for my pocketbook, anyways).  I have long, fine hair that TANGLES so easily.  This stuff works magic on it.  Changes the texture of it to soft.  You dont need to use that much of it--a dimes worth, so even if it is expensive, you know its gonna last you a long time.  Def worth it

I have long, straight hair. I am not really big on using hair products, but I use just a half- dime size of this stuff. I love it because it is light (it is like i didnt add anything extra to my hair), leaves my hair very silky soft, helps control some of that extra static, and smells great! :) 
The bottle lasts a pretty long time- I have had mine for over a year now and it a small size.

My son had some baby acne and his face was a little dry.  They said not use soap on his face and I didn't think it ever felt as clean as I wanted it to.  So I tried this and the Mustela Bebe face lotion and the acne cleared and his face is nice an soft now.  It has a nice scent as well, not the usual baby scent that everyone knows and loves though.  But is still nice

I am thrilled with this product, which is great for diaper changes and wipe ups (face, nose area, hands).  It truly requires no rinsing and has been wonderful when used on both my sensitive skin daughters aged 2 and 10 months. We have never experienced a negative reaction to this product and its light, clean scent is divine.

I love this stuff!  The pink on the high of the cheek bone really lifts your whole face and the darker line beneath, gave my face a fantastic elegant look. A definite for that red carpet feel, although I wear it everyday.  No-one can quite work out why I look so good, I'm sure everyone thinks I've had botox....

LUSH continues to amaze with each and every item I try lately. This Fair Trade Foot Lotion works perfectly as a daily foot lotion or is perfect in combination with the Volcano Foot mask for occasional pampering. 

Almond oil, cocoa butter, spearmint, peppermint and Tagetes Minuta flower oil blend perfectly together in this delicately pink lotion. The results are pretty impressive and the moisturizing benefits last overnight. The lotion soothes and moisturizes and leaves your feet with a little pepperminty tingle. I'll be using this a lot in the summer!

It feels all tingly and cold on my feet. Perfect after a hard day of walking or shopping. It's perfect for people who are on there feet all day likes sales associates and moms too who are chasing kids all over the place all day long. This is one of my favorite products. It also helped my rough callouses to become smoother. Highly recommended

This cream is loaded with cocoa butter (obtained by Fair Trade) and scented with spearmint, my favorite mint. It is soothing and cooling. It is nice rubbed all the way from foot to knee and really works well. The scent is strong--LOTS of SPEARMINT. That's the best part of it, as this is cooling for the feet and keeps them smelling clean and nice long after you bathe

I honestly thought I was going to have to give this one a lower star rating. Upon receiving this item in the mail, I dove right in. The one drawback that immediately hit me was the smell. It basically smells like mint toothpaste. I knew it was going to be minty, just not quite so minty. So I smoothed some on and rubbed it up to my ankles. The sensation was very cool and I was surprised how oily and slippery my feet were. I'm used to most feet creams sinking in and kind of dissapearing. 

So, my initial thought was pleasant, but kind of wierd. Now I have to say though, that as a soother and moisterizer it works great. My feet are are very soft and it works at the rough parts of me feet very well. I'm excited to try this with an exfoliater of some sort. 

I took away one start for the toothpaste smell, but really this is an awesome product. In the summer I'll probably keep this stuff in the fridge. I imagine it would feel great when really really cold after a long day of work

HI

<review_text>
I have been using Fair Trade Foot Lotion for about a week now and have really noticed a difference.  I live in Hawaii and constantly wear slippers (flip flops, thongs, etc.) so my feet are exposed to the elements 24/7.  

For the past several months, I have been having very sore feet (aches when I walk on them).  I have since discovered LUSH's Fair Trade Foot Lotion and their foot mask Volcano (see my review).  Even though I just started using the lotion, with continued use of both, I have noticed a decrease in soreness and my feet look WONDERFUL!  I've always had cracked, scaly, callus feet, but not anymore.

I would get pedicures just to help with the appearance of my feet, but I haven't gotten one in months now!  Fair Trade Foot Lotion absorbs quickly as long as you don't use too much and makes your feet feel so refreshing.  I just put a little on at night and my feet are good to go the next morning!

Definitely give this one a try

       If you're a scandal in your sandals due to winter neglect better hot foot it out and buy some Fair Trade Foot Lotion.  Pedicures are wonderful but somehow the effect is lost if the season's hottest color is applied to toes topping rough, unsightly feet.  

	Fair Trade is every bit as pretty as your tootsies will soon be - it's pink and pepperminty.  However, we wise ones know you can't tell a lotion by its color.  The ultimate sole salve, Fair Trade moisturizes with cocoa butter, almond oil, glycerine and lanolin.   Plus, spearmint and peppermint are circulation aides with antifungal properties.  (Foot fungus is a definite turn-off, even if he has a foot fetish).

	Now, after a week or two you'll know the true meaning of sole support, arch support, and fabulous feet.  Why, your now elegant extremities may even put those new Jimmy Choo's to shame.

My husband and I take a pot of then when we go on holiday, and after a long day of walking around, we come home with sore feet and massage each other's with Fair Trade until we feel that we can stand up again. It's brilliant stuff, and probably the only way we've made it back out of the hotel for dinner some nights

After years of searching I've finally found the perfect perfume. Pink Sugar makes me feel fabulous when I wear it; it's so light and `warm' with a base of sensual vanilla. I have the large bottle, body mousse &amp; deodorent at home, and the smaller bottle in my handbag. I don't get bored with this fragrence, like I do with everything else I've tried over the years.

The first time I wore Pink Sugar to work one colleague commented on the aroma of drinking chocolate as I was in the lift with her. The next time I was in the lift, everyone commented on my lovely vanilla perfume. After I applied a freshen up spray, another colleague said she could smell cakes! Yet another colleague demanded to know what I was wearing, and where she could get some. Strangers come up to me in the street to ask what scent I'm wearing...

No this isn't a cheesy ad, it really happened!! 


What do I sense first? Liquorice, a rich aniseed scent that gradually settles into a middle note of caramel. Marshmallow is the first word that springs to mind to me. 

If you like Angel, Fantasy or Princess you need to give this a try!



 *Aquolina needs to make Pink Sugar available to the U.K. - Postage and packing costs a fortune!!!

        Yep, this is an eye shadow, but one with a WOW factor.  It's a fine silky powder that applies easily (with Laura's Wet/Dry Definition Brush) and stays from  crow of the rooster to  coach turning into a pumpkin.

	The Mineral Eye Powders collection comes in six shades ranging from a soft almost nude to a midnight hue with blues and greens in between.  My current favorites are "Milky Way" - a moonlit sheen and "Eclipse."	

	When used dry these powders deliver a subtle shimmer all over  the eye; wet is your choice for added definition or to be used as a liner.

	Love the packaging - a small pot with an opening for brush and a snap lid - no mess no fuss, only great looking eyes!

Think of it as loose eye shadow and eyeliner . . . with a kick. Laura Mercier Mineral Eye Powders are so incredibly versatile and can be applied wet or dry, as shadow or as liner, that it's possible to create endless different looks that range from casual and pretty to stunning and dramatic. Choosing to apply wet or dry will not only change to application but will give you beautifully different textures and definitions and degrees of sparkle.  

Using the mineral eye powder wet will make the color and look more intense and defined but will give it less sparkle. You'll also get an increase in the wear and the added option of using the powder as a liner. Using the powders dry will give them the most sparkle punch.

Laura Mercier Mineral Eye Powders come in six different shades -- two light colors: Milky Way &amp; Galaxy and two intense colors: Meteor, Eclipse, Constellation, &amp; Asteroid.

All Laura Mercier eye products are ophthalmologist and dermatologist tested.


Color Notes:

Milky Way - a very light, barely pink, opalescent color that will not only add silver toned sparkle but will lighten the feature or eye shadow color on which it is applied. Choose this color if you want to highlight and lighten.
 
Galaxy - a very light, barely grey-taupe color that will add gold tone sparkle but will otherwise blend into all but the darkest skin colors. Choose this color if you want the starstruck look but don't otherwise want to change your eye shadow color. This color will also work well on other areas of the face. Try putting just a dab in the inside corner of each eye for a real, yet subtle, eye pop.

Meteor - an intense color of green in the forest family with silver toned sparkle. Makes the most amazing eye liner color. 

Eclipse - an intense color of black with silver sheen. Makes a classic looking eyeliner color but with the updated twist of star struck sparkle.

Constellation - an intense color of purple that's similar to Laura's famous Black Violet Kohl Pencil. The sparkle on this one is gold tone. Women with green or hazel eyes will love how Constellation makes their eye color really pop. 

Asteroid - An intense color of dark blue with silver sheen. Makes a beautiful eye liner for brown and blue eyes and will help remove redness from the eyes of any shade. 


Basic "how to use" tips:
    * To line the eyes: dampen Wet/Dry Definer Brush with water, dip into one of the four darker shades, and mix to desired consistency. I like to use the back of my hand as a `palette' to mix the powder. To increase the shimmer, apply more powder on top of the eyeliner but this time use the brush dry. To further lengthen the wear of the powder as a liner, first line the eyes with one of Laura's Kohl Eye Pencils and then apply the powder on top.  This will also give your liner extra sheen.
    * To use as eye color: dampen Wet/Dry Definer Brush with water, dip into a darker shade and mix to desired consistency, once again using the back of the hand. Apply to eyelid and blend color with Ponytail Brush or apply directly to the eyelid with the dry brush- using wet leaves a sheen finish, using dry leaves a sparkly finish.

Fun "how to use" tips:
-Try Meteor as a shadow, lined with the Eclipse, and smudge Constellation all around for that smokey smudgy look.
-Cover your entire eyelid with Milky Way and line with Asteroid.
-Put dots of Galaxy in the inside corners of your eyes and just apply mascara

For a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is MAC. Lipglass feels good on your lips, as if it contained some emollients. And (this is a big AND) it's not tacky or sticky. 

The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. 

Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. 

Enjoy!

I'm REALLY anal about scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored with vanilla, but MAC LipGlass isn't that vanilla-ish at all!  It's got very pigmented color, it stays on a LONG time for a gloss, and each tube lasts a long time...  Don't let what the other reviewer said about the vanilla scent throw you off

As a cosmetologist this tool is amazing! If you don't know how to use it, I could see how it would be frustrating. It works wonderfully and does not abrade or damage the dermal layer like using your fingers. It's a great way to remove comedones in a sterile and effective way

I love cK One! It has a very sweet, subtle, citrusy fragrance; and on me, friends and family just rave about it!! (Even my orthodontist had complimented it once). Too bad the scent doesn't last very long. After a couple of hours, a re-touch is neccessary. That's my only pet-peeve, but no star is deducted. This is not a perfume and I don't expect the scent to be long-lasting. I think this fragrance is great for everyday use. If cK One complements with your body chemistry, then don't hesitate to buy it

This is a nice, light daytime fragrance that's pleasant to wear on weekends and other casual times. (For evenings, nothing comes between me and my Must de Cartier!) It's citrusy but has a little more depth and balance to it so you don't go around smelling like the fruit stand at the store.  This was the first unisex fragrance I ever tried and I was surprised that I liked it, though it's a bit "soft" for my husband's taste so I'll never get him to try it. That's probably for the better, I'd hate to start sharing fragrances with him.

So I read all the reviews here before purchasing it and decided I'd give it a go due to all the good feedback...And I'm so glad I did! I've been a regular Lancome mascara user for awhile- started with Definicils, went to L'Extreme, but this is what I'm sticking with.  My lashes look loooong...and that's saying a lot because I have some pretty puny lashes.  Not only does it lengthen, but it seperates and thickens.  I also bought the Cils Booster (I think that's what it's called - it's the Lancome mascara primer) and my lashes just pop.  Great product

I first purchased Hypnose for my wedding last summer and I absolutely loved it!  I should be a spokesperson for Lancome because I refer this product to everyone when they talk about my beautiful, thick lashes.  I recently went into Bath and Body shop and a saleswoman was trying to get me to buy their mascara.  That day I didnt have any on, so I told her that I already had a product that would make her go shop at Lancome.  I told her to stand on the side of me while I applied it.  She was in shock.  "Oh my gosh-Look at how your lashes just grew!  She had me stop while she grabbed another store clerk and a customer.  She went on break and we walked to the Lancome counter and she bought some right then!

My only problem with this mascara is that it is so thick, you must use a creamy makeup remover to get it off.  Using a liquid will just frustrate you because it will do nothing.  Also, never accidentally fall asleep with it on because it will be there in the morning! It lasts through tears, sweat and even the pool.  Truly a wonderful produc

To add a little oomph and a pop I also use Defencils mascara primer. Lashes to die for

I am a 19 year old Cosmetology student, so trust me, I've tried out probably 100 different mascaras in the past 2 years. Lancome's Hypnose is my absolute favorite, hands down the best all-around mascara. It does it all for your lashes. It really brightens your eyes, and brings out your beauty :). It is especially good if you are looking for a thickening mascara

I've only used this twice so far (last night and this morning) but already I've noticed my skin is not as oily and it's really soft after I rinse it off.  I'm intrigued by the entire Lush product line - glad I stumbled upon this.  I've got some samples on the way (won off an auction site) and I can't wait to try them.  Also, this seller was awesome when UPS for some reason thought I moved.  When I called Lush a live person answered the phone and called UPS for me.  UPS called me within 30 minutes and offered to bring it out that night.  Wonderful!!  My skin is oily with lg pores and blackheads - go ahead and give this a try if this sounds like your skin.  The only drawback is it's a little on the messy side but not too bad

Works great for combination skin!
Herbalism is meant for oily skin; however I find it perfect for my combination skin.  It never leaves my skin dry or patchy, and throughout the day my skin has a nice matte look, thanks to the rice bran in the cleanser.  

I tried this as a sample and although it worked really well, I didn't care for the strong herbal scent of Herbalism and I didn't like the rose petals in the cleanser because they `got in the way' or just fell in the sink as I cleansed.  I prefer a cleanser with a more uniform consistency (like LUSH's Angels on Bare Skin; see my review), so I only buy Herbalism in small quantities (less than $5 amounts) and use it when my face is really feeling oily.  Other wise I use LUSH's Ocean Salt or Angels on Bare Skin as my nightly cleanser.

Still an overall great product!

I have oily asian skin and I have tried the other lush facial cleansers (fresh farmacy, angels on bare skin, and aquamarina) and this is the one that has greatly improved the quality of my facial skin. I use it once a day after coming from work and before going to bed. It has just taken care of my skin. I've had late nights, stressful times, lack of sleep, sometimes I haven't been able to wash my face at all. To top it off, I'm a smoker. Since using this product, I've gone through those and I've only gotten 3 pimples. When that happens to me, my face is usually peppered with blackheads and pimples. Herbalism has really taken care of my facial skin. This stuff is exquisite and a keeper

I dont know what they put in it, I just know that it works. Within three days of getting this product from the Chicago LUSH store, my face had cleared up beautifuly.

I've had really awful skin, blackheads, whiteheads, deep cystic acne, since I was around 14, and I've tried anything I could get my hands on to take care of it (Proactive, and everything else)   I had a problem finding a product that would clean up my super oily skin without irritating it because its very very sensitive. This did the trick beautifuly (and followed up with some Celestial mosturizer after some hardcore exfoliation) Made my face feel very soft and smooth after washing instead of all itchy and flakey.  My pores also looked noticably smaller as well.

Plus it smells great

I have combination skin prone to little breakouts. Since using this, my skin feels far more balanced, and I've kissed my breakouts goodbye. 
The product is a fairly thick paste which smells green and fresh and sort of pine-y. I find the best way to use it is to dampen my face, put a little lump (dime-size) on my fingertips and rub it all over like I was washing with a teeny tiny bar of soap. :) It exfoliates really gently and when I rinse off I find I have smooth soft skin that is already moisturized, neither oily nor dry. I use it daily and love it, love it, love it

The "Creamy Candy Bath Melt" is what turned me on to LUSH in the first place. In addition to vanilla, I absolutely adore sweet candy-type fragrances and this is no exception. The melt moisturizes your skin without leaving it feeling greasy and the smell is yummilicious! I try to order multiples of these at a time so that they are always on hand since I never know when the mood to use one will strike me (I'd use them just about all of the time if I could).

If you like super sweet and girlie, then go for it and try Creamy Candy! :

This is a super-rich bath for those with very dry skin. The melt is basically oils, a luscious scent, and some soaping or foaming agents to make the oils disperse into the bathwater and not float on top like they would otherwise. It can sometimes be a little too rich for my skin, but I love the scent so I use it occasionally anyway and just rinse off afterwards with some Rock Star soap.

The scent is the lovely Rock Star scent, a vanilla-y candy scent that kids also love.

I tend to be beauty-frugal, so I tend to expect a modern-day miracle when I spend more than 25 dollars on a beauty product.  
I really like this moisturizer, which feels good and gives my skin a nice, supple feeling for not-too-much product.  

However, no miracle, just a nice skin cream

I love this day cream. It smells great and hydrates beautifully without looking greasy. The only downfall is that it doesn't have SPF, so you have to apply additional sunscreen over it. As for its treatment qualities, I do think it made my skin somewhat more radiant and smoother, and it didn't make me break out. It's a great product for the price

I disagree with the negative reviews. These wipes are the softest and softer than the Kirkland wipes. My husband couldn't use the pamper wipes since they would cause sever redness on my 1st born's butt area. It was raw. Once we switched to Mustela, no matter how hard my husband wipes, our baby's skin is still nice and soft. We have used this since our 1st born and we are on our third. The smell is nice and not powerfull. I love the wipes

This is quite a good shampoo for fine hair.  I did get a lot of volume, but it also made my hair feel a bit dry at the ends.  I've found LUSH's Big shampoo to give me the volume and it makes my hair feel healthy and silky as well.  This is still good, but not quite as good

This stuff is costly but a little of it goes a long way. The texture of this is perfect. It's creamy but not overly moist. It sets nicely and has a natural dewy finish with a medium coverage. It never looks cakey or overly done like other medium formulations. I can use a dallop the size of a quarter for almost a week. At that rate I think a bottle should last a very long time. Its also the only brand that perfectly matches my very fair skin (of course how it matches you depends entirely on you!)

While in Sephora looking for a new Nars lipstick, a pretty Dior rep approached me.  I would have normally declined her offer of a mini-make-over, but I was feeling rather adventurous and wanted to update some of my make-up items, so I followed her to her chair where she went to work on me.  

I have to say, in the past, I have been nonplussed and unimpressed with makeovers like these.  But when the rep handed me the mirror, I gasped.  Even under the harsh lighting, my complexion looked pretty darn flawless for a youthful grandmother trying to hold on to any vestige of good looks.  

I bought the foundation, along with the finishing powder and a few other Dior goodies.  I figured I would probably use it a few times and realize it didn't really look as good on me at home or in the office as it did when the Dior rep did my makeup in the store.  Then I would experience buyer's remorse and continue my quest for the perfect foundation. 

Lucky for me, I was wrong.  This product has become one of my top choices for foundation.  It doesn't settle in the fine lines around my eyes, or in my pores.  Instead, it does what it says -- smooths out my complexion. The color chosen for me looks natural with no lines of demarcation. And the coverage is what I prefer at this stage in my life.  

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I am still searching for this type of lush coverage that gives my combo skin less shine by mid-day.  But for now, I will finish using the bottle, and probably purchase another, which is something I haven't done with other foundations in some time.  

My biggest tip with this foundation is a little goes a long way.  The Dior rep used a make-up brush and that tends to give more of a sheer, even coverage.  At $50, it wouldn't seem to be a bargain, but if you use it as I've described, it should last you several months.

This foundation is worth every penny.  It DOES make your face feel firmer and look younger on the first use. Don't ask me how it works, I don't know, but the tiny lines around my eyes disappeared.  ALSO, it holds up against heat, sweat, tears.  It doesn't rub off on your clothes, either.  The only way I'll ever leave this foundation is if Dior themselves come up with a new improved formula, which I can't see happening.  Try it at the counter, walk around a look at yourself in the mirror.  You'll say, "WOW, Amazing!" TOO

Walking through airport security just last week, I was stopped by a TSA employee who asked "Who's wearing cologne?!"

I said "Not me!" before realizing that I WAS wearing some karma kream. I said so, and she asked where I'd gotten it. Phew! I was thinking someone had allergies or something and I was one of those people who was wearing too much perfume/lotion/whatever, oblivious to the fact that everyone around them was holding their nose. But she was actually really curious, and followed me past security so she could get the name of the store (Lush!) that sells this great stuff. 

Seriously, it's great! I've never in my life had anyone remark on any perfume or scented lotion I was wearing until I found karma kream, which I received as a sample in a recent order of Lush goodies. Now strangers, relatives, and friends are all asking me where they can get some of this stuff. 

The karma scent is really, really great - citrusy, with a tiny hint of lavendar, pine, and patchouli. You won't smell like a dirty hippie, though, trust me. The patchouli and pine are just bass notes to the main players - orange flower water, citrus, and lavendar scents. So fresh! It's great. Really wakes me up in the morning, and refreshes me during the day if I put some on.

This lotion won't leave your skin feeling greasy, either, like so many moisturizers can. My skin is really thanking me for discovering Lush products. If you want a subtle perfume but don't want something as strong as a concentrated perfume, this lotion is great, and as an added benefit, it will moisturize your skin while you're wearing it! And if you want a light perfume, you can put some karma kream on your neck, arms, or legs to have just a hint of scent.

      Karma might be loosely described as destiny.  It's a  fate that  occurs as  an effect following a cause.  Okay, since we may have some control, what would you like to bring about? (Let's save the arrival of Prince Charming for another time).  If you'd like the effect to be beautiful, soft, touchable, kissable, skin, just smooth on Karma Kream.

	One other effect caused by Karma Kream is a delightful lingering fragrance.  Those nearing  the nape of your neck with notions  of nuzzling  may not be able to identify the subtle bouquet - they'll only know it's irresistible, this blend of Orange Flower Water, Lavender Oil, Lemongrass, Patchouli and other good scents.

	It's said that more people in the world believe in karma than do not.  Hmmmmm, don't know about that.  But, I do know that all of us want good karma and that's  Karma Kream.

	There now, apply Karma Kream before bedtime and rest well secure in the knowledge that your skin will be softer in the morning, and some day your Prince will come.

I love patchouli. Unfortunately, it is very hard to find in pure form.  Often it is mixed with other perfume scents.  The Body Shop offers wonderful products and this perfume oil is no exception. I only hope that they continue offering this scent.  Try it, you won't be disappointed

Although most every fitness magazine I read has at least 2 articles about "Health and Beauty/Grooming", I'm still pretty certain that we're, Most Men in General, still in the woods in regard to proper skin care. The times are changing, more rapidly than ever before, and the need for separating the good, the bad and the ugly is HERE!

I'm a fairly active 37 year old male with fairly nice skin, although my Italian heritage prediposes my olive skin to being much oilier than I'd like. I have small areas of "Combination Skin", in addition to my generally oily skin type, which has often been more difficult to manage than anything else. Gone are the days of Vaseline and generic cleansers and moisturizers. Welcome are the days of skin products designed for treat and maintain almost any possible skin type. 

My review is submitted, as I, too, had no idea that "Philosophy" was anything other than one of the hardest classes I ever surived through in College! When I told my close friend, an aspiring and very beautiful female model and actress, that she REALLY had a youthful glow and joked about her having "Some cosmetic work done!", she accepted it quite well and with a big southern smile. She told me that it wasn't plastic surgery and it wasn't any high-tech laser procedure or over-priced exfolliant scrub. Instead, she said she was on the run and would stop by to visit with myself and my spouse after dinner.

Karin came over with a bag full of goodies, everything from home-baked chocolate chip and almond cookies to a gift certificate for a nice eatery in town (since I had mowed her lawe and few times)! But that wasn't the end of the gifts. She proceeded to give us 2 Philosophy Skin Care Products. My spouse had heard of them in a recent review in a popular magazine, but it was all brand new to me. Karin said that it was a gift for both of us and she wanted us both to use the exfoliator AND the moisturizer too. My spouse was thrilled to death with the new "products" and I was more thrilled (at that time) with the warm chocolate chip cookies.

Before bed we started to use the 2 products. Applying quality products was not new to me and over the years I've spent a few thousand in quality products to reduce my oily skin that often lead to acne-even after I turned 30. I didn't expect anything other than the ordinary smoothe and clean feeling after exfoliating, combined with the relaxed and cooling feel of the moisturizer. BOY-What a surprise I was in for!!

This is not a joke and I am not here with any special interest-other than to give a totally honest review of these products. My skin, in just 3 weeks, went from oily (with some combination areas) to normal and from shiny to glowing. Most impressive of all, was that (without any sort of drying effect on my skin) my facial acne is 90% gone. And I'll be truthful in telling you, in this review, that when my face is clear and looks good, I FEEL GOOD TOO!

I didn't have severe acne, but it was enough to consistently bother me and surprise me when I least needed an "outbreak!"
I'm sold on these products and am online to purchase products for my Mom and her 2 Sisters in New York. I used to work as a professional actor and model, mostly doing television commercials and some print work. So I've tried just about everything and I've had some luck with other products-but NOTHING like the overall masculine and finsihed look that Philosophy Products brought to me. I'm 100% sold and I hope that this review was helpful to you. It's from mmy heart and it's the truth. I hope and pray that you have similar or even better results that I have experienced. Good Luck To You! You won't be unhappy with these products, all of which are under a great satisfaction guarantee (another reason I tried them)!

Let me know how it works out!

This is without a doubt one of the best items I've ever bought.  I have very fair, very dry skin.  I need a moisturizer that will give me SPF protection that's over 15 (this has 25) and something that will absorb into my skin, and not feel liked I just smeared Vaseline on my face.  One jar (1.7oz) lasts for a long time, a good 6 months at least!  (A little goes a long way)  Some lotions have an obnoxious smell; even when it does say "fragrance free," this lotion has a clean smell, not bothersome at all.  I really feel like I'm doing something healthy for my skin when I put this on, like I've armed my face with what it needs to get through the day.  "Super Defense" is the right name for this moisturizer!  I do not go out into the day without wearing it.

I discovered the Caswell-Massey line by accident; having bought brushless Burma shave from another internet provider.  When I ran out I searched "Amazon" first and discovered this product.

At any rate, I believe that the scent is accurate.  In addition, the preshave oil followed by their sandlewood shaving cream gives one as close a shave as I have ever experienced.  Used to suffer from 5:00 "shadow", being in sales this is unsightly; after using the C.M. product that is a thing of the past.

This excellent product is expensive.  However, a hot, wet lather shave for this reviewer makes this mundane chore pleasurable.  The badger hair shaving brush is a nice addition or it makes a great gift.  

A British concern, Truefitt and Hill also are of interest to shaving and personal care customers

I am also a fanatic of sandalwood products and have searched the world (literally) for same. I have found this brand to be slightly different than one might expect from sandalwood, but still very pleasing. A little pricey, but not more than to be expected for sandalwood. I've also tried their after shave, soap, and shampoo. I've been very satisfied with all of these sandalwood products and will continue to purchase them until I find something better.

The first time I used this soap I didn't like it at all until I got out of the shower and felt my skin.  It was really soft and smooth.  I can't quite agree with the others about the smell though.  I found it kind of medicinal, but it could be just the bar I got.  However it lathers really nicely and everytime I use it my skin is so soft.  So I will buy it again, maybe the next batch will smell a little better

This soap is great! It smells like the ocean, really! Seaweed and sea salt gently exfoliate your skin, and pine, lime, and lavendar give it a really fresh scent that leave you feeling clean and rejuvenated after washing with it. 

I'm going to buy a big old chunk of this stuff next time I go to Lush, then cut it myself into a chunk of soap that's mostly seawee/sea salt, to use for scrubbing in the shower, and another that's mostly glycerine, just for washing my hands at the kitchen/bathroom sinks. The smell is great, so I can't limit myself only to using it once a day in the shower, right? Right!

This stuff lathers up better than most other Lush soaps I've tried. The scent is perfect for women OR men - very unisex, which is nice. I really don't like most flowery, female scents. Even my husband used this stuff

HI

LUSH's Sea Veg soap is one of my favorites.  Perfect for men and women because the scent is more refreshing then anything else.  That's because of the loads of lime in the soap.  This soap gets you super clean and the top of the bar is covered with real seaweed (super mineral rich) and sea salt grains that are great for exfoliating away dead skin.

Though it is a glycerine based soap, it doesn't 'melt' away as fast as I thought it would.  My half-an-inch thick slice has lasted me more then a month and I still have a lot to go.

Highly recommended

        Yep, my mate grinned when I told him one of my new favorite soaps was Sea Vegetable.  

	He's no longer laughing, he's using MY soap!  Neither masculine nor feminine the scent of Sea Vegetable is  totally refreshing, laced with lavender and lime oils.   Do believe he's thinking of becoming a pirate as he sings away in the shower, sudsing with MY soap.  Remember what it's like to walk along a beach when the day is fresh and new?  That's reminiscent of this fragrance.

	Deep blue in color the soap is topped with a wave of Atlantic sea salt crystals - so invigorating!  It gives the skin a bit of a tingle and softens at the same time.

        There he goes again - singing at the top of his lungs.  Well, I have a refrain for him: "Yo, ho, ho, matey!  Forget that bottle of rum and buy me another wedge of Sea Vegetable!

I have tried this product as well as others by Mustela and I think they are fenomenal.  I gained 60 pounds with my first pregnancy and did not get strechmarks.  You must be very disciplined and put it on everyday.  Although this cream is a bit pricey, it does wonders at hydrating your skin so why not pamper your body!!!

I've tried a lot of different blotting sheets and these are the best. These definitely blot the oil off your face and leave just a little bit of powder so you look fresh. I've tried the Body Shop's and the powder free ones don't work as well, and the powder ones leave too much powder on your face. I love these things

Another top Lush product.  My husband and I used this in our hot tub on vacation and had so many bubbles that they overflowed the tub!  I also like the idea that if you travel a lot, that you don't have to worry about bottles leaking.  It's kind of fun to see what colors you get, as it is a suprise.  Well worth the money.

I used to shave my bikini area regularly and got so tired of the razor bumps and ingrown hairs that came along with it so I decided to give Brazilian bikini waxing a try. The results are much more precise, longer lasting and smoother. But I was still getting those big ugly ingrown hairs. So the wax technician gave me a couple sample bottles of TendSkin. There was a noticable difference after 24 hours but I still had quite a few bumps remaining. I don't know if it was because I'm so suspectible to ingrown hairs or because I had so many to start with but it took a couple of months for my bikini area to completely clear up with twice daily application of TendSkin. I also exfoliate my bikini area several times a week - exfoliation will go a long way in preventing ingrown hairs. With the exfoliation and the daily application of TendSkin, the ingrown hairs are completely gone. I now use TendSkin only once a day and that is sufficient. My bikini area has never looked better. My only gripe with TendSkin is the cost - I put off buying a bottle for the longest because it's so expensive. I have one of the small 4 ounce bottles that I found at the less expensive price of $13 but that's still a bit much for this product. I'll continue to buy it because it works but it'd be nice if it were a little cheaper.

And for those who are wondering about the rubbing alcohol smell, I found that on me it disappeared as soon as the TendSkin dried. So don't let the smell of it deter you - if you are prone to ingrown hairs, TendSkin is the product for you. And to help it along, it's also a good idea to exfoliate the area regularly. :

I've been wearing Lucky You for several years now.  I really like it a lot!  I can't even tell you exactly what kind of scent it is...  It's not flowery, it's not fruity and it's definitely not "old lady!"

It's fresh, like clean laundry and it makes me feel youthful!  In fact, for some reason, it always reminds me of that Debbie Gibson perfume from the 80s, Electric Youth...  With the neon pink spring in the bottle!  Ah, the good ol' days!

I LOVE this foundation. I have Warm Sand Moisture Rich Foundation. It is incredibly smooth, long wearing and the color makes my skin look bright and radiant. Bobbi Brown makes very natural foundation colors and there is a range of colors for all different skin tones. When I'm shopping it seems that most lines cater to lighter and medium skin tones, but Bobbi Brown really does come through with flattering options for all skin tones. The only draw back is that this foundation does not provide adequate SPF protection, even though it says SPF 15. Therefore, you will still need to wear a sunscreen underneath of at least SPF 15. I use this foundation every day and I wear sunscreen from Paula's Choice (which I love). I think that the color options available, the long lasting color and the smooth texture make this foundation worth the price.

I really like this product. It does leave your hair quite soft and shiny. I have very thick, curly hair so anything that can make my hair softer is great in my book. I applied the treatment, wrapped my hair up in a plastic bag, and put a hot towel on it. I microwaved the towel every few minutes to make sure it would stay warm. I left the treatment in for about 40 minutes. When I first recieved this product, I thought the scent was actually pretty gross. But it does smell better after you wash it out.

I used this product for the first time over the weekend and the smell is amazing! Just like fresh baked gingerbread cookies. I have very thick, medium length, naturally curly hair - I left the product on for about 45 minutes and my hair turned out soft and shiny. It's 2 days and 2 shampoos later and I can still catch the faint smell of gingerbread. Wonderful

Okay, I am a bit biased because I have a soft spot for Polo products but the Polo Black is arguably the best I have used in years. And I use and finish a new cologne every month. The after smell is great, it is not overpowering, it is great in the morning and in the evening. Plus it doesn't hang on your clothes, so if you wear your shirt again, it doesn't have this "hanging" smell. For the first time in years, I am going to use the same cologne for 2 consecutive months! A great product

I love the consistency of this lip balm.  It's light, and not sticky.  The smell of this balm reminds me of lemon bars, and I love it.

The reason for the 4/5 stars is two things.  Sometimes the smell is a little overwhelming.  This is entirely a personal preference, and is only something that happens some of the time.  The other reason is that the balm tends to not last very long on me, and I find that a little annoying.  I usually just reapply, but that means that I end up using this up faster than a lot of glosses that I have used.

I definitely am going to buy this again, but knowing full well that I'm just going to be buying it again sooner than I'd like

Although this lip treatment costs a fair amount as far as lip balm goes, I don't know how my lips would live without it! It smells like lemon cookies and has a velvety finish... and it has SPF 15, too. The ceramic tube is easy to find in your purse and doesn't break easily. After using this lip balm for a week, my lips were already less chapped. I reccomend this lip treatment for everyone

Imagine pouring creamed coconut and vetivert oil on your hair, now imagine this was made into a bar and it foamed into lush moisturizing bubbles. This shampoo bar is pretty amazing in how it deep cleans and moisturizes like a dream. Your hair will feel super clean and shiny and I like following this with the American Cream Conditioner. 

Mmm, I can't stop running my hands through my hair, it is just amazing! The last time I remember my hair being this soft was when I was about 10! I rarely say wow, but WOW. If you love this, "Godiva" is calling your name. The shampoo bar, I mean...

I'm not really excited about the coconut scent. I can take it or leave it. The shampoo itself is good, though. I have very long thick hair, and this leaves it feeling soft, yet clean and not weighted down. I'm left with a lot of body afterward. I haven't had any trouble getting it to lather, but if you're new to Lush products, give them a few tries before giving up. They don't have silicones and other products to weigh your hair down, so you will see some changes in your hair as it is getting healthier

I bought this on a trip to Canada ... my hotel shampoo was very drying.  

The shampoo is weird to use the first time, I lathered it in my hands like soap and then worked it through my fine long hair. Not too oily for me and I really like the smell. It took care of the dry fly away feel the cheap stuff in my hotel had left.

I brought several different sized chunks back to friends who all thought it was fun.

I purchased the index 1 kit from [...] for [...].  I asked my hair stylist to apply to my hair.  She agreed to relax my hair with this product just out of curousity.  My scalp did not burn in the process.  It smelled like any other relaxer.  It straightened my hair.  I would continue to use but the price is too steep for a stay at home mom like me, but I wanted to try it after reading about in Essence magazine.  Vanessa L Williams said she uses it and her hair feels terrific.  I have very fine hair.  It had been nearly a year since I relaxed my hair.  I was giving my hair a break.   I usually relax my hair every 3 months.  My hair stylist said she would not buy it.  She added it's like any other no-lye relaxer

I have read all the Phyto Index 1 reviews to date...most negative ones sounded as if they either chose the wrong Index or needed a hair professional to apply the product properly (one must be highly skilled to apply this professional product by one's self and work quickly in application) and be able to judge how to gauge the proper relaxing time...as a trained cosmetologist, esthetician and registered nurse I have used both Index 1 and 2 on friends and relatives with great satisfaction...as a woman of Native-American and Afro-American heritage who has thyroid dysfunction (which can negatively effect the quality of one's hair and scalp) I have used the Index 2 with tremendous satisfaction

I absolutley love Murad's Acne Spot Treatment. As soon as you feel a spot coming up just dab a little on and its gone in 1-2 days.  Murad Acne Spot Treatment works without making the spot look scaley and dry and it helps reduce the redness of the pimple.  I would recommend Murad Acne Spot Treatment to anyone who has a small breakout problem to the most severe breakouts

I received a free sample of this and although I don't have acne it comes in very handy for the occasional blemish that I used to just cover with concealer until it went away. I had once tried Mario Badescu's formulation of basically calamine lotion which you would not want to wear out in public. I got a blemish recently and after just a few applications of Murad's Spot Treatment it was banished. It's clear with no dry feeling and doesn't show up on your face. It works and works fast

Marc Jacobs" the fragrance is young, fresh, and sensuous. It's pure, understated, simple, and unforgettable. 
Somehow he has done things with gardenias unheard of before. Remember granny's favorite gardenia perfume, a bit cloying, heavy? Uh-uh forget that. This interpretation of gardenia is cutting edge, it complements without overwhelming the wearer. 

Notes of Sicilian Bergamot and Tagete mingle with the top note, as accents of White Pepper and Egyptian Jasmine enrich. 

This is a fragrance for confident, unconventional young women.

Perfect for a weekend vacation or as larger sample sizes, the natural products will make your skin feel moisturized and pampered. Rice Bran is the secret to these products and the results are immediately apparent in the texture of your skin. After just one to two uses, you start to notice a sense of calm and order descending upon your formerly sensitive skin. 

If you have oily or combination skin, you may be amazed at how balanced your skin is and how you no longer experience the shine breakthrough in your makeup due to the initially drying aspects of other cleansers. 

1. The Komenuka Bijin Facial Cleansing Foam is very economical and an eighth of a teaspoon is enough for a wonderful face cleansing experience. The ingredients include: Rice Germ Oil, Rice Bran, Coconut Oil, Seaweed, Aloe Algae, Ginkgo Biloba, Matricaria, Yeast, Perilla Ocymoides, Honey, Lithospermum and Fountain Water. 

2. Follow the cleanser with the Komenuka Bijin Skin Lotion and you may wonder why you are suddenly catching the scent of SAKE. In fact, this cleansing toner does contain SAKE along with Rice Bran, Seaweed, Aloe, Yeast, Glycyrrhizate, Orange, Lemon, Matricaria, Algae, Luffa Cylindrica and Fountain Water. The toner completes the process of removing impurities and also has the added benefit of contracting the pores so they look smaller. Men may also enjoy this as an aftershave lotion. If the toner is not included, they normally include the NS-K Special Toner with even more healing ingredients. 

3. The Moisture Cream goes a long way. The main oils are Rice Germ Oil, Jojoba Oil and Olive Oil. Vitamin E, Rice Bran and Aloe make this a skin-healing treat. 

4. Eye Moisture Jell - Also contains apple acid, lemon, seaweed and loquat leaf. Smooths the delicate eye area. 

5. Makeup Remover - A fragrance-free cream that removes makeup and mascara. Based on olive oil. 

6. Two Cleansing Powder Packets - Deep cleansing grains turn silky and creamy when you add water. 

7. The UV Cream is slightly tinted and waterproof. This sunblock also seems to even out skin tone. Could be used as a makeup base if you are looking for a more natural look. The cream is easy to apply and absorbs easily into the skin. You can apply this on its own or after the moisture cream and skin essence. 

8. Skin Care Cream - A body cream that is very healing with jojoba oil. 

9 &amp; 10. Hair Shampoo &amp; Conditioner - Thickens fine hair instantly. Removes buildup and leaves your hair feeling luxurious. 

If you are looking for an easy way to try out the skincare system or you just want to take these products with you wherever you go (they are addictive), then I can highly recommend this and any of the Komenuka products. I love how calm they make me feel. These products cover all bases and whether you live in a cold, dry or humid climate, your skin will feel protected. 

Other products to fall in love with: 

The Skin Essence contains Mulberry that naturally lightens discoloration from sun damage and aging. The antioxidants help to revitalize the skin. This is applied before the cream. 

Moisture Cream Silver - Super hydration with aloe, vitamin E and Rice Bran.

Almost all the colors that this lip gloss comes in are very ordinary. Very light pinks, frosty pinks and oranges, and browns are the basis of the colors. Flirt, Pixie, Babydoll, Whimsy, Fantasy, and Piglet are not a very wide range of colors, but they are still nice. I'm not so sure about Oxygen, though. I have never really seen silver lip gloss, so I don't know how it would look on me. Hello, people, why not make a shade of red? Red is a classic in any lip color, so that's a color to try. What about a dark pink? Or a bright orange? If you were thinking of coming out with these colors already, great. But is not, those are some suggestions

This is a very complex scent, and mellows after wearing for awhile, but still leaves a subtle scent for quite a while.  Especially effective worn with the body lotion and shower gel

My daughter has very sensitive skin and these are great.  They clean her face and hands in between baths, and don't irritate her skin at all.  I really like the scent too.  If you don't like the way other Mustela products smell you won't like these, but if you do then you'll love them.  My only complaint, and the reason they didn't get 5 stars, is the packaging.  The package tends to not stay closed after a few days.  So if you aren't using the wipes regularly they can dry out

i have wavy hair and apply "be curly" to my wet hair before blow-drying with a diffuser.  it makes soft, non-frizzy, non-crunchy waves and has a fantastic herbal scent.  what i don't understand is why this website charges 4 dollars more per 6.7 oz bottle than the aveda store or aveda website.

This H20+ Tango Mango Shower and Bath Gel is wonderful.  The gel is so thick and supple with bath beads that your body will thank you for it.  The mango aromoa will lift your senses first thing in the morning and get you ready for the day!  I have to hide this stuff or my children will use it all up  -  they like to squeeze the gel out and pop the beads inside.

I suggest this bath gel if you want to give yourself a shower or bath treat.  It's well worth the money and would be a great addition to a "relaxation" gift basket for a friend

Looking for a tropical smell to take you back to your summer vacation in Maui?  This is it... all packaged in a bottle and a heck-of-a-lot cheaper than the airfare it took to get you there!  The exotic gardenia fragrence will put you in a trance as you float through your day... imagining yourself next to the Four Seasons pool instead of in a carpool with your children and their friends!  

I purchased this in Tiburon, CA on our way home from Napa last year and I've found myself reliving that initial moment when I first sprayed it on in the boutique.  My friends and I all melted at the aroma.  I've used it everyday since and have purchased more for myself and some as gifts for others!

I love to take my morning shower, towel dry and spritz this all over!  My senses are heightened and I'm off for a day filled with whatever -- it really wouldn't matter what took place b/c I feel so fresh and flirty -- ready to take on the day!

I highly suggest you make the purchase now and stop waiting for something to push you over the edge!

I have been using this product for 3 weeks now. It has definitely helped my acne-prone oily skin look more refined and toned. The only caveat to the product is that it mildly stings after you put it on. I have found that it does control oil production throughout the day. Overall, a good product! Works well with the Glycolic Foaming Cleanser

I happened to go to Neiman Marcus over my lunch break to check out some new lipgloss at the Yves Saint Laurent counter and ended up at the Bobbi Brown Counter.  The sales lady talked me into letting her put the rouge on my cheeks in the color - pale pink.  Wow it made me look so good. It made me look like I was glowing or flushing from the inside there was no telltale marks of blush on my face. I bought it on the spot. This did not have as great effect on my lips, it looked like I had lipstick on, but I'll just use it on my cheeks. I highly recommend this product.

This is absolutely my favorite bubble bar. They did not skimp with the patchouli, and the result is divine. Blue Skies' fragrance combines wonderfully with several of the bath bombs, so experiment. I have to admit, I am addicted to LUSH

Woo, the bubble bar that I got must have been really fresh! It was enough scent for 3-4 baths, but that wouldn't have been enough bubbles, so I used it for 2 baths that smelled VERY strongly! 

Not really a very relaxing scent, more of a refreshing, up-and-at-'em morning scent. It will definitely wake you up. The patchouli smell, which I love, is stronger in this bubble bar than in other Lush products. 

Suggestion: I would combine this with a karma bath bomb (also has a hint of patchouli scent) for a great combination of smells! 

The blue skies bubble bar WILL turn your bath water a scary blue color, but that's ok, because it smells good and leaves your skin silky smooth with its essential oils

Smells wonderdul and not masculine at all.  It is woody but light and intoxicating; I can't stop sniffing it after a bath.  The price is high but it is a large bar.  I usually cut it up and still have plenty of bubble/scent power

I ordered the 30-day supply of the Murad Acne Complex--just to see what it was all about.  I have always had oily skin and those little bumps on my forehead--but my biggest problem was blackheads on my cheeks/nose and those painful red bumps that always show up when I shave.  After only a week or so of being on the Acne Complex, I IMMEDIATELY noticed a reduction in the post-razor bumps as well as the little red bumps on my forehead.  And the refining mask is AMAZING!  Let it sit on your face for 10 minutes and you'll be amazed at how it makes blackheads DISAPPEAR.  Plus, Murad's formula doesn't have any of that drying benzoyl peroxide, which means no irritation, no drying, and no bleaching the collars of your expensive shirts.  If you've got acne problems, you owe it to yourself to give Acne Complex a try

MURAD IS REALLY W0RTH Y00R TIME.

I recently washed my hair with all of Carol's Daughter Tui products and after I blow dried my hair and put a little oil in it, it was very soft, manageable and easy to wrap.  Overall, I think it's a great product
