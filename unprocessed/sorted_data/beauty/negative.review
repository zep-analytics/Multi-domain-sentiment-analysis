I bought this because I have fine hair that needs to be washed every day and I get tired of washing it.  I thought I could use this every other day and get by. 

However, it doesn't make your hair look freshly washed; it is just ok.  It takes "bed head" hair and makes it look acceptable for a little while.  After a couple of hours though, my hair looks oily and stringy again.

I use it before I take the kids to school and it gets me thru the morning.  Then I end up washing my hair later

I like Jonathan Anton &amp; some of his products, but this one was a very bad one.  It smelled like swamp water.  His other products smell great.  I don't know what happened to this one.

I bought this because a friend had it and it smelled wonderfully of roses.  There must be a quality control problem.  My bottle had no noticible, pleasant sent and therefore did nothing to freshen my hair.  I was only trying to go 1 day without washing.  What a disappointing product and a waste of my money.  :

After using this product, I felt less than fresh.  Then I realized that it is only for use on the hair and skin on your head.  I would have been better off using a can of Evain spray and gotten the same effect at less money

I was again disappointed as this did not make me feel "fresh".  In fact if you mix it with the Dirt in your hair it causes some type of nasty reaction and your hair becomes sticky and gooey - nothing fresh about it.

I saw Jonathan on QVC and was really impressed with the claim that the Moisturizing Conditioner was great for dry/damaged hair.  He also said that his products don't strip the color out of hair like some of the brands on the market.  I color and highlight my hair and wanted something that would protect it.  What a disapointment.  The conditioner bottle is horrible at dispensing even a small amount of conditioner.  I had to remove the lid.  Then, it's like paste...doesn't seem to go through the hair..even after 3 minutes.  When I tried to comb my hair out, it was like a birds nest.  I had to put a spray leave in conditioner, by another line, in my hair just to comb through it.  I ordered it from QVC...and it's going back

I WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT!  I WAS GIVEN THE SHAMPOO FOR CHRISTMAS WHICH WHEN WASHING MY HAIR MADE LITTLE TO NO SUDS.  WHEN TRYING TO COMB OUT MY HAIR AFTER SHAMPOOING IT WAS LIKE A BEES NEST AND I COULDN'T POSSIBLY GET A COMB THRU IT.  THATS WHEN I ORDERED THE CONDITIONER WHICH WAS LIKE CAKE BATTER AND COULDN'T GET IT TO COME OUT OF THE CONTAINER WITH REALLY QUEEZING IT WHICH MADE THE LETTERING COME OFF ON TO YOUR HANDS AND I FOUND SOME IN MY HAIR. I SQUEEZE AND BANG UNTIL I FINALLY GET A BIG LUMP COMING OUT.  I HAD WATCHED ALL OF JONATHAN'S REALITY SHOWS WHEN HE WAS WORKING ON CREATING HIS PRODUCTS AND COULDN'T WAIT TO TRY THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL NATURAL. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!  I RECENTLY SAW HIS SHOW BACK TV WHERE SOMEONE CALLS HIM UP AND SAYS THEY TRIED HIS PRODUCT AND HOW HAPPY THEY WERE AND JONATHAN GETS ALL CHOCKED UP.  I WAS SCREAMING AT THE TV I WAS SO UPSET.  THE PRODUCT WAS NOT CHEAP AND CAN'T BELIEVE I CAN'T USE SOMETHING I SPENT SO MUCH MONEY ON.

On a scale of 1 to 5, the packaging gets a negative 1. You can't sqeeze the conditioner out of the bottle, ended up removing top.

For value of product, Jonathan gets a 1.

For quality of product 3.

The conditioner feels like vegetable shortening or softened butter. Need to use more than average. The conditioner is average in detangling and after using it four times it does condition your hair, but no better than other quality brands. I do like that it seems to cut down on the drying time, but Bed Head has a similar product that's been out for a while. For that option I would rather choose Bed Head for quality and price

I had high hopes for this stuff. I have watched Blow Out and know that he knows his stuff when it comes to hair, but I cant seem to get this stuff to actually do anything for my curls and waves. I have tried it on wet hair, damp hair, dry hair-no discernable difference. I will stick to my Frederic Fekkai products-they actually work

I spent a lot of money on this product &amp; waited with anticipation for it to arrive. When I applied it, it did nothing to "create" curl and didn't even define the curls that I already had. My hair was limp and frizzy by days end. It smelled nice &amp; that's about it. Cheap-o Suave gel or mousse works better and creating and holding curl

RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN... DO NOT TRY!  Okay, so I bought in to the hype of "Blow Out".  Once I saw the "JONATHAN" product line on the shelf, I thought, "Hmmm, how yummy!"  Boy, was I disappointed.  The moisturizing shampoo was anything but!  The product felt like a mixture of tree sap and glue.  Once applied to the hair, I felt knots forming.  Upon rinsing, my hair like it had been stripped!  I used lots of the companion conditioner hoping for a balancing act, but was left aghast when I rinsed and felt the "new" texture of my hair.  I couldn't comb it out with a wide tooth comb until I applied a leave in conditioner from another product line!  Once dry, my hair felt gritty, brittle and generally nasty.  I'M TAKING THIS STUFF BACK AND DEMANDING A REFUND!  I'm going back to my Frederick Fekkai products immediately

Watching the show I thought that Jonathan really cared about hair and its no doubt that he does still but his shampoo leaves alot to be desired. For example, even in the hot, very humid atmosphere of Houston, TX it left my hair feeling dry and unhealthy, even after using his conditioner (alot of it). My hair looks awful after using it. And the bottle claims that it doesn't use toxic ingredients like MEA but it DOES use three different types of PEG, a petroleum based thicker found in most bath products that can erode wooden tables in just minutes. This is just as harmful as MEA, especially for people with sensitive scalps and hair. And it claims not to strip your hair but the products that are supposed to cleanse are much less apparent in the product than the PEG products. Since PEG is a thickener, you're also getting a diluted, toxic, solution. Even though Head and shoulders uses MEA I find that that even that works better than this. My hair doesn't feel like it has any more of its essential oils and I've switched back to the other hair products Iv'e been using. It's not worth your 20 dollars, its barely worth 5 dollars. My hair stylist also recommended Dove products if you need hydration. DON'T BUY IT!

I used a sample and liked the fact that it cleaned my hair the way I want my hair cleaned.
 Not washed with useless lather and coated with all kind of smoothening silicon products. People have beconme so used to the mass produced garbage that is sold in gorcery stores, that they do not realize they are paying for detergent. In the long run it is damaging for the hair and after some hours it really does not have that nice clean bounce that hair is supposed to have.
Jonathan is not the only good product out there. I have been using Phyto Shampoo from France and Kiehl's, both don't have the silicon smoothers either and yes, the hair does feel like straw right after you wash it. Get a big tooth comb and some guts and go through life with really clean hair!!!!
I used my sample and will buy a big bottle of the Shampoo. I have not tried the conditioner, but will try it too.

Is this shampoo or sap??  What exactly is it supposed to do??  I received a sample of this shampoo and I am ever so glad I got to try it free before I actually spent money on it.  Not only did my hair feel like straw, as mentioned by other reviewers, but it was so heavy I couldn't do anything except rewash it with my regular shampoo.  I'll save this one for Halloween.

I see several previous reviews that acknowledge the fact that this shampoo leaves your hair feeling like "straw" yet say that is because this shampoo leaves your hair so clean!  Are you kidding me?  If having "clean" hair means having my hair feel like straw and it does literally feel like straw, then I'll happily return to having "dirty" hair...seriously, I've had smoother, softer hair from drugstore shampoos that cost .99 than this 20 dollar shampoo and conditioner!  I could not even run a comb through my hair while it was wet because this product left my hair feeling so rough! I have rather dry hair, and I merely tried this product on a lark, just to see if it was any good because I am a fan of Jonathan and his show, so I will return to my drugstore shampoo, Dove and Pantene which have always worked well for my dry hair.

Okay, I'll admit. I bought into the hype. Oooo, no "sulfates"... Oooo, "essential water".... Oooo, "all natural" - no animals sacrificed in the making or testing of this - "vegan" shampoo and conditioner...

I headed into the shower with confidence that I had finally dumped $35 on a shampoo and conditioner set that would make a difference to my fine straight hair. And what a difference it made...the volume created by the products was all flyaway hair: styled by the static electricity generated by my hair being devoided of any moisture that it once held by this lovely "dessicant" shampoo. And no amount of the so-called conditioner helped to right the wrong! I tried various amounts of conditioner and left it on for longer and longer periods of time without any change in results. After 3 days of feeling the wicked witch of the west was having better hair days than I was, I returned the product.

This product truly deserves 0 stars!!

I was excited to purchase Jonathan product after watching two seasons of Blow Out.  Unfortunately, I was really disappointed after using this conditioner on my hair.  My hair is very thick and after using this conditioner it left my hair a sticky and tangled mess.

Unfortunately, the fragrance of the conditioner is great but that's about it

I purchased this item after seeing Jonathan's show.  As much as I enjoyed his program, I am sorry to say that this product is just terrible.  It weighed down my hair, and made my hair look greasy before I was even done styling!  The day after using the product, my hair looked like an oil slick!  I DO wish Jonathan much success, but these products need a lot of work.  Very disappointing after spending almost 60$ for two bottles that remain full in the back of my cupboard

My naturally curly hair is thinning and I thought this conditioner would be helpful. The conditioner did not handle the tangles in my hair nor did it make it feel conditioned. I thought it was too drippy. I nearly used half a bottle by pouring it into my hand. I would not recommend this conditioner

This product totally frizzed out my hair. I had been having good luck for once with Paul Mitchell's foaming mousse. This Jonathan product,sadly, rather than taming my hair, induced the frizz. A lot. Perhaps a stronger formula is needed, or maybe I just don't have fine, limp enough hair I was very sad

I have dried my hair daily for 20 years now. I bought the T3 Tourmaline with great excitement. Come on - its 200$, the most I have ever used on a hairdryer. I did NOT reduce my hair drying time at all, but it did make my hair less frizzy and more shiny..But all in all- too much money for too little help!

I'm sure that this hair dryer is of exceptional quality - perhaps worth the price to some. But I'd be careful about buying something that uses fake science babble to try to convince you of its effectiveness. "most ionic and infrared" is gibberish. Tourmaline, a gemstone, has electrical properties (when squeezed or heated, it develops a charge across the crystal), but that has nothing to do with hair drying, or ionizing air, or anything else. I'd recommend buying a less expensive but still high-quality hair dryer instead of falling for a pseudoscientific scam

I bought this lipgloss at my local Sephora store. First of all..DO NOT EXPECT TO SEE ANY PLUMPING WHAT SO EVER. It makes No difference in how your lips look. Secondly, it takes forever to get the gloss to come out on the rolly ball. The ONLY reason this gloss is $18 is because of the Too Faced name brand. DONT waste your money on this when there are lipglosses just as good/better for a few bucks at the drugstor

I would absolutley love this product if it came with an apllicator brush instead of a roller ball. The roller ball hardly lets any of the gloss come out, and you find yourself rolling it over &amp; over again to get a decent amount of gloss. The gloss itself is pretty(once you get enough on your lips.) And it does taste &amp; smell delicious. But it is way too much trouble with the roller ball. I would suggest they make this with an applicator brush. It would make a great product

I previously left a very positive review of the shampoo and conditioner, however, after using it for several days, my hair feels heavy, dirty and coated with something.  I know Jonathan loves his product "Dirt" but it does not belong in a volumizing product for women with fine, limp hair.  I don't need anything else to weight my hair down.  It does not feel clean after washing and drying it.  I am quite disappointed as I really loved the way both products smelled. I had to wash my hair a second time today because it would not do what I wanted it to do and it felt like the "second day" after washing it. I still recommend the volumizing foam.  That is a nice product.  Smells wonderful and does not weight your hair down or cause it to become full of static as products with a lot of alcohol do.

Not sure what is in this stuff but it turns my fairly healthy hair into the texture of straw.  Even my own sylist said, whatever you are using...STOP..you hair feels very damaged.  It goes back to normal texture if I use my other shampoos.  I made sure to use it on and off to be sure it was the Jonathan shampoo..and it was.  It went into the trash.  Don't purchase this stuff...unless you're going for the scarecrow look

I was so excited to try this "amazing-hyped" shampoo,I bought the kit from QVC.All I can say is what a disaster.My hair which is coarse,it instantly turned to straw. No lather,horrible tangles,the conditioner did not help at all (left it on for 10-15 min).I also contacted Jonathan Procduct,Inc(4) times and left messages for them to please call me to discuss the problem with their product. NO RESPONSE! All Hype-No Action! Don't waste your money. $60 is alot to pay for itchy dry hair.If you look in beauty supply stores there are other brands that are sulfate-free also, such as Mastey(Code Red

After the debacle that was Dirt I tried to repair the damage by making my now filthy looking hair shiny.  Well now my hair was not only dirty it was shiny and dirty.  Is this a joke.  I am sure that Jonathan was not trying to deceive people by charging such exorbitant prices for a hair cut if he was not a man of substance and yet here I am trying to wash this out of my hair, with his very shampoo and all I have is tears. Clearly this is not Product Without Tears.

If you want your hair to feel like it has day old elementary school vanilla pudding in your hair then this is a 5 star product for ya!  If you like your hair clean and nice, pass on this.  I tried this, and my god anything I rested my head on; chairs, car seats, pillows, my boyfriend, my child! was left with a greasy gooey stain on it.  Seriously  I think this stuff is going to cost me more in cleaning bills then anything else I have ever used on my body.  And I still have the original hair damage in my dern hair!!!  Maybe if he had killed an animal or 2 for this product I would not be left with this mess.

I bought the Tourmaline hoping to save time, because I have very thick, wavy hair that takes 45 minutes to dry and straighten.  It ended up taking just as long, but the results were much better.  My hair was super straight and shiny, and it didn't get frizzy even in humid weather.  Then when I was using it for just the 4th time, it completely stopped working.  Just as other people described, the red light shut off and it cooled down, and never turned back on.  I'm in the process of trying to get a refund or replacement now.

I received this as a gift.  I was thrilled with the results the first few times I used it.  Then the little red light went out while I was straightening my hair and it has never worked since.  I only got to use it three times

My Review

<review_text>
I bought this product at Sephora.  I had it for about two weeks and used it only 2 times.  When I tried to use it after that, the little red light wouldn't come on and it just wouldn't work.  I took it back to Sephora for an exchange since I was still within the 30 day exchange period.  The second one worked for about two months...then the SAME thing happened.  I was only using it maybe once or twice a week, the most.  This product is horrible.  I never dropped it or anything like that.  In fact, as soon as it would cool down after using, I would place it back in the box it came in.  I am actually in the process of returning it to the manufacturer.  Honestly, I wanted a good flat iron and I thought this was a good product because it was expensive...BIG MISTAKE.  My friend bought a straight iron for about $100 and she's had it for almost a year.  She also straightens her hair a lot more often than I do.  I don't know why I didn't ask her where she got hers.  Please read all the reviews before you make this purchase.  If you don't believe me, wait to see if someone you know buys it so you can find out first hand how bad this product is.

this product did not dry my hair as described on the box.  It did straighten my hair, but that was all.  I had to dry my hair with a blow dryer and then use this T3 iron which eliminates the whole reason for buying it.

On my third use, I set it down on the carry case and it sizzled. I looked more closely and it started shooting sparks out of the cord, right where it is connected to the handle! I immediately unplugged it, and now there's a hole in it where the sparks were coming out. I am so grateful I wasn't using it on my hair when this happened! What with the straightening balm I was using and everything, my hair could've easily started on fire

I have to say that for a gel it had the same consistency and feel of K-y jelly - frankly I am not familiar with personal lubricants but that said there was the smell that reminded me of my gynecological exams.

I saw Jonathan on QVC and was really impressed with the claim that the Moisturizing Conditioner was great for dry/damaged hair.  He also said that his products don't strip the color out of hair like some of the brands on the market.  I color and highlight my hair and wanted something that would protect it.  What a disapointment.  The conditioner bottle is horrible at dispensing even a small amount of conditioner.  I had to remove the lid.  Then, it's like paste...doesn't seem to go through the hair..even after 3 minutes.  When I tried to comb my hair out, it was like a birds nest.  I had to put a spray leave in conditioner, by another line, in my hair just to comb through it.  I ordered it from QVC...and it's going back

I WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT!  I WAS GIVEN THE SHAMPOO FOR CHRISTMAS WHICH WHEN WASHING MY HAIR MADE LITTLE TO NO SUDS.  WHEN TRYING TO COMB OUT MY HAIR AFTER SHAMPOOING IT WAS LIKE A BEES NEST AND I COULDN'T POSSIBLY GET A COMB THRU IT.  THATS WHEN I ORDERED THE CONDITIONER WHICH WAS LIKE CAKE BATTER AND COULDN'T GET IT TO COME OUT OF THE CONTAINER WITH REALLY QUEEZING IT WHICH MADE THE LETTERING COME OFF ON TO YOUR HANDS AND I FOUND SOME IN MY HAIR. I SQUEEZE AND BANG UNTIL I FINALLY GET A BIG LUMP COMING OUT.  I HAD WATCHED ALL OF JONATHAN'S REALITY SHOWS WHEN HE WAS WORKING ON CREATING HIS PRODUCTS AND COULDN'T WAIT TO TRY THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL NATURAL. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!  I RECENTLY SAW HIS SHOW BACK TV WHERE SOMEONE CALLS HIM UP AND SAYS THEY TRIED HIS PRODUCT AND HOW HAPPY THEY WERE AND JONATHAN GETS ALL CHOCKED UP.  I WAS SCREAMING AT THE TV I WAS SO UPSET.  THE PRODUCT WAS NOT CHEAP AND CAN'T BELIEVE I CAN'T USE SOMETHING I SPENT SO MUCH MONEY ON.

On a scale of 1 to 5, the packaging gets a negative 1. You can't sqeeze the conditioner out of the bottle, ended up removing top.

For value of product, Jonathan gets a 1.

For quality of product 3.

The conditioner feels like vegetable shortening or softened butter. Need to use more than average. The conditioner is average in detangling and after using it four times it does condition your hair, but no better than other quality brands. I do like that it seems to cut down on the drying time, but Bed Head has a similar product that's been out for a while. For that option I would rather choose Bed Head for quality and price

I bought this lipgloss at my local Sephora store. First of all..DO NOT EXPECT TO SEE ANY PLUMPING WHAT SO EVER. It makes No difference in how your lips look. Secondly, it takes forever to get the gloss to come out on the rolly ball. The ONLY reason this gloss is $18 is because of the Too Faced name brand. DONT waste your money on this when there are lipglosses just as good/better for a few bucks at the drugstor

I would absolutley love this product if it came with an apllicator brush instead of a roller ball. The roller ball hardly lets any of the gloss come out, and you find yourself rolling it over &amp; over again to get a decent amount of gloss. The gloss itself is pretty(once you get enough on your lips.) And it does taste &amp; smell delicious. But it is way too much trouble with the roller ball. I would suggest they make this with an applicator brush. It would make a great product

RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN... DO NOT TRY!  Okay, so I bought in to the hype of "Blow Out".  Once I saw the "JONATHAN" product line on the shelf, I thought, "Hmmm, how yummy!"  Boy, was I disappointed.  The moisturizing shampoo was anything but!  The product felt like a mixture of tree sap and glue.  Once applied to the hair, I felt knots forming.  Upon rinsing, my hair like it had been stripped!  I used lots of the companion conditioner hoping for a balancing act, but was left aghast when I rinsed and felt the "new" texture of my hair.  I couldn't comb it out with a wide tooth comb until I applied a leave in conditioner from another product line!  Once dry, my hair felt gritty, brittle and generally nasty.  I'M TAKING THIS STUFF BACK AND DEMANDING A REFUND!  I'm going back to my Frederick Fekkai products immediately

Watching the show I thought that Jonathan really cared about hair and its no doubt that he does still but his shampoo leaves alot to be desired. For example, even in the hot, very humid atmosphere of Houston, TX it left my hair feeling dry and unhealthy, even after using his conditioner (alot of it). My hair looks awful after using it. And the bottle claims that it doesn't use toxic ingredients like MEA but it DOES use three different types of PEG, a petroleum based thicker found in most bath products that can erode wooden tables in just minutes. This is just as harmful as MEA, especially for people with sensitive scalps and hair. And it claims not to strip your hair but the products that are supposed to cleanse are much less apparent in the product than the PEG products. Since PEG is a thickener, you're also getting a diluted, toxic, solution. Even though Head and shoulders uses MEA I find that that even that works better than this. My hair doesn't feel like it has any more of its essential oils and I've switched back to the other hair products Iv'e been using. It's not worth your 20 dollars, its barely worth 5 dollars. My hair stylist also recommended Dove products if you need hydration. DON'T BUY IT!

I used a sample and liked the fact that it cleaned my hair the way I want my hair cleaned.
 Not washed with useless lather and coated with all kind of smoothening silicon products. People have beconme so used to the mass produced garbage that is sold in gorcery stores, that they do not realize they are paying for detergent. In the long run it is damaging for the hair and after some hours it really does not have that nice clean bounce that hair is supposed to have.
Jonathan is not the only good product out there. I have been using Phyto Shampoo from France and Kiehl's, both don't have the silicon smoothers either and yes, the hair does feel like straw right after you wash it. Get a big tooth comb and some guts and go through life with really clean hair!!!!
I used my sample and will buy a big bottle of the Shampoo. I have not tried the conditioner, but will try it too.

Is this shampoo or sap??  What exactly is it supposed to do??  I received a sample of this shampoo and I am ever so glad I got to try it free before I actually spent money on it.  Not only did my hair feel like straw, as mentioned by other reviewers, but it was so heavy I couldn't do anything except rewash it with my regular shampoo.  I'll save this one for Halloween.

I see several previous reviews that acknowledge the fact that this shampoo leaves your hair feeling like "straw" yet say that is because this shampoo leaves your hair so clean!  Are you kidding me?  If having "clean" hair means having my hair feel like straw and it does literally feel like straw, then I'll happily return to having "dirty" hair...seriously, I've had smoother, softer hair from drugstore shampoos that cost .99 than this 20 dollar shampoo and conditioner!  I could not even run a comb through my hair while it was wet because this product left my hair feeling so rough! I have rather dry hair, and I merely tried this product on a lark, just to see if it was any good because I am a fan of Jonathan and his show, so I will return to my drugstore shampoo, Dove and Pantene which have always worked well for my dry hair.

This foam product by Jonathan is okay.  The reviews on his products are highly overrated.  The price doesn't bother me at all.  There are better foams for thin and limp hair

This product totally frizzed out my hair. I had been having good luck for once with Paul Mitchell's foaming mousse. This Jonathan product,sadly, rather than taming my hair, induced the frizz. A lot. Perhaps a stronger formula is needed, or maybe I just don't have fine, limp enough hair I was very sad

I previously left a very positive review of the shampoo and conditioner, however, after using it for several days, my hair feels heavy, dirty and coated with something.  I know Jonathan loves his product "Dirt" but it does not belong in a volumizing product for women with fine, limp hair.  I don't need anything else to weight my hair down.  It does not feel clean after washing and drying it.  I am quite disappointed as I really loved the way both products smelled. I had to wash my hair a second time today because it would not do what I wanted it to do and it felt like the "second day" after washing it. I still recommend the volumizing foam.  That is a nice product.  Smells wonderful and does not weight your hair down or cause it to become full of static as products with a lot of alcohol do.

Not sure what is in this stuff but it turns my fairly healthy hair into the texture of straw.  Even my own sylist said, whatever you are using...STOP..you hair feels very damaged.  It goes back to normal texture if I use my other shampoos.  I made sure to use it on and off to be sure it was the Jonathan shampoo..and it was.  It went into the trash.  Don't purchase this stuff...unless you're going for the scarecrow look

Okay, I'll admit. I bought into the hype.  Oooo, no "sulfates"...  Oooo, "essential water"....   Oooo, "all natural" - no animals sacrificed in the making or testing of this - "vegan" shampoo and conditioner...

I headed into the shower with confidence that I had finally dumped $35 on a shampoo and conditioner set that would make a difference to my fine straight hair.  And what a difference it made...the volume created by the products was all flyaway hair: styled by the static electricity generated by my hair being devoided of any moisture that it once held by this lovely "dessicant" shampoo.  And no amount of the so-called conditioner helped to right the wrong!   I tried various amounts of conditioner and left it on for longer and longer periods of time without any change in results.  After 3 days of feeling the wicked witch of the west was having better hair days than I was, I returned the product.

This product truly deserves 0 stars!!

I was so excited to try this "amazing-hyped" shampoo,I bought the kit from QVC.All I can say is what a disaster.My hair which is coarse,it instantly turned to straw. No lather,horrible tangles,the conditioner did not help at all (left it on for 10-15 min).I also contacted Jonathan Procduct,Inc(4) times and left messages for them to please call me to discuss the problem with their product. NO RESPONSE! All Hype-No Action! Don't waste your money. $60 is alot to pay for itchy dry hair.If you look in beauty supply stores there are other brands that are sulfate-free also, such as Mastey(Code Red

After the debacle that was Dirt I tried to repair the damage by making my now filthy looking hair shiny.  Well now my hair was not only dirty it was shiny and dirty.  Is this a joke.  I am sure that Jonathan was not trying to deceive people by charging such exorbitant prices for a hair cut if he was not a man of substance and yet here I am trying to wash this out of my hair, with his very shampoo and all I have is tears. Clearly this is not Product Without Tears.

If you want your hair to feel like it has day old elementary school vanilla pudding in your hair then this is a 5 star product for ya!  If you like your hair clean and nice, pass on this.  I tried this, and my god anything I rested my head on; chairs, car seats, pillows, my boyfriend, my child! was left with a greasy gooey stain on it.  Seriously  I think this stuff is going to cost me more in cleaning bills then anything else I have ever used on my body.  And I still have the original hair damage in my dern hair!!!  Maybe if he had killed an animal or 2 for this product I would not be left with this mess.

I bought the Tourmaline hoping to save time, because I have very thick, wavy hair that takes 45 minutes to dry and straighten.  It ended up taking just as long, but the results were much better.  My hair was super straight and shiny, and it didn't get frizzy even in humid weather.  Then when I was using it for just the 4th time, it completely stopped working.  Just as other people described, the red light shut off and it cooled down, and never turned back on.  I'm in the process of trying to get a refund or replacement now.

I bought this product at Sephora.  I had it for about two weeks and used it only 2 times.  When I tried to use it after that, the little red light wouldn't come on and it just wouldn't work.  I took it back to Sephora for an exchange since I was still within the 30 day exchange period.  The second one worked for about two months...then the SAME thing happened.  I was only using it maybe once or twice a week, the most.  This product is horrible.  I never dropped it or anything like that.  In fact, as soon as it would cool down after using, I would place it back in the box it came in.  I am actually in the process of returning it to the manufacturer.  Honestly, I wanted a good flat iron and I thought this was a good product because it was expensive...BIG MISTAKE.  My friend bought a straight iron for about $100 and she's had it for almost a year.  She also straightens her hair a lot more often than I do.  I don't know why I didn't ask her where she got hers.  Please read all the reviews before you make this purchase.  If you don't believe me, wait to see if someone you know buys it so you can find out first hand how bad this product is.

this product did not dry my hair as described on the box.  It did straighten my hair, but that was all.  I had to dry my hair with a blow dryer and then use this T3 iron which eliminates the whole reason for buying it.

On my third use, I set it down on the carry case and it sizzled. I looked more closely and it started shooting sparks out of the cord, right where it is connected to the handle! I immediately unplugged it, and now there's a hole in it where the sparks were coming out. I am so grateful I wasn't using it on my hair when this happened! What with the straightening balm I was using and everything, my hair could've easily started on fire

This product works well when I use it with a curling iron.  The low rating is for the cost.  I just don't think it is worth over $20

I have dried my hair daily for 20 years now. I bought the T3 Tourmaline with great excitement. Come on - its 200$, the most I have ever used on a hairdryer. I did NOT reduce my hair drying time at all, but it did make my hair less frizzy and more shiny..But all in all- too much money for too little help!

I'm sure that this hair dryer is of exceptional quality - perhaps worth the price to some. But I'd be careful about buying something that uses fake science babble to try to convince you of its effectiveness. "most ionic and infrared" is gibberish. Tourmaline, a gemstone, has electrical properties (when squeezed or heated, it develops a charge across the crystal), but that has nothing to do with hair drying, or ionizing air, or anything else. I'd recommend buying a less expensive but still high-quality hair dryer instead of falling for a pseudoscientific scam

I bought this because I have fine hair that needs to be washed every day and I get tired of washing it.  I thought I could use this every other day and get by. 

However, it doesn't make your hair look freshly washed; it is just ok.  It takes "bed head" hair and makes it look acceptable for a little while.  After a couple of hours though, my hair looks oily and stringy again.

I use it before I take the kids to school and it gets me thru the morning.  Then I end up washing my hair later

I bought this because a friend had it and it smelled wonderfully of roses.  There must be a quality control problem.  My bottle had no noticible, pleasant sent and therefore did nothing to freshen my hair.  I was only trying to go 1 day without washing.  What a disappointing product and a waste of my money.  :

After using this product, I felt less than fresh.  Then I realized that it is only for use on the hair and skin on your head.  I would have been better off using a can of Evain spray and gotten the same effect at less money

I was again disappointed as this did not make me feel "fresh".  In fact if you mix it with the Dirt in your hair it causes some type of nasty reaction and your hair becomes sticky and gooey - nothing fresh about it.

I have to say that for a gel it had the same consistency and feel of K-y jelly - frankly I am not familiar with personal lubricants but that said there was the smell that reminded me of my gynecological exams.

I had high hopes for this stuff. I have watched Blow Out and know that he knows his stuff when it comes to hair, but I cant seem to get this stuff to actually do anything for my curls and waves. I have tried it on wet hair, damp hair, dry hair-no discernable difference. I will stick to my Frederic Fekkai products-they actually work

I spent a lot of money on this product &amp; waited with anticipation for it to arrive. When I applied it, it did nothing to "create" curl and didn't even define the curls that I already had. My hair was limp and frizzy by days end. It smelled nice &amp; that's about it. Cheap-o Suave gel or mousse works better and creating and holding curl

Okay, I'll admit. I bought into the hype. Oooo, no "sulfates"... Oooo, "essential water".... Oooo, "all natural" - no animals sacrificed in the making or testing of this - "vegan" shampoo and conditioner...

I headed into the shower with confidence that I had finally dumped $35 on a shampoo and conditioner set that would make a difference to my fine straight hair. And what a difference it made...the volume created by the products was all flyaway hair: styled by the static electricity generated by my hair being devoided of any moisture that it once held by this lovely "dessicant" shampoo. And no amount of the so-called conditioner helped to right the wrong! I tried various amounts of conditioner and left it on for longer and longer periods of time without any change in results. After 3 days of feeling the wicked witch of the west was having better hair days than I was, I returned the product.

This product truly deserves 0 stars!!

I was excited to purchase Jonathan product after watching two seasons of Blow Out.  Unfortunately, I was really disappointed after using this conditioner on my hair.  My hair is very thick and after using this conditioner it left my hair a sticky and tangled mess.

Unfortunately, the fragrance of the conditioner is great but that's about it

I purchased this item after seeing Jonathan's show.  As much as I enjoyed his program, I am sorry to say that this product is just terrible.  It weighed down my hair, and made my hair look greasy before I was even done styling!  The day after using the product, my hair looked like an oil slick!  I DO wish Jonathan much success, but these products need a lot of work.  Very disappointing after spending almost 60$ for two bottles that remain full in the back of my cupboard

....comes hefty disappointment. Andis is a good brand of clipper, "however" $80 for this pair of clippers is $70 too much. The power is weak and it takes about 24 hours to fully charge. 

These clippers are not designed for professional use at all. I am not a barber, my wife cuts my hair every 2 weeks or so. It does a decent fade job and my 2 boys(3 and 4) are mixed and seems to cut through their hair with a little more ease than mine. 

However it seems that my past corded clippers had more power which translate to easier cutting and trimming. My wife has to constantly go over various spots multiple times because it did not hit the spot the first or 2nd time.

My recommendation is to do your research and go with another pair of Andis clippers, stay away from this pair, or you'll be finding yourself writing a review saying I agree with the first guy that reviewed this product

I bought this product thinking that it was so pricey it just had to work. Well it doesn't. I followed the directions and went through two bottles with no results what so ever. I'm 24, 23 when I tried the product... no reason it should not have worked if it actually worked at all. If it doesn't work it should get 1 star because it is not delivering on its promise and the promise is why people buy this stuff. I wish I hadn't listened to the raves on this product

I bought the cream hoping to get rid of, or at least lighten stretch marks from pregnancy.  I have used it three times a day for 3 months and have seen no results.  It smells horrible and having to apply 3 times a day is really a pain in the hind parts.  I was very optimistic after reading some of the other reviews.  I'm now very disappointed.  If something sounds too good to be true, it is

I used to love Curious. I asked for it for my birthday and my boyfriend bought me the large bottle with the atomizer and the lotion. However, a few months after I got it, it started to smell funny... over time the atomizer became very hard and had a sticky film all over it. When I opened the bottle I gaged at the stench. I poured it down the sink and it was yellow. I do not recommend buying this product and if you must have this scent please don't buy it with the atomizer. The lotion still smells good.

Like many others, my perfume turned yellow as well. I think it only happens with the atomizer. Perhaps exposure to air SOURED the perfume. I am throwing it away as soon as possible because it no longer smells good. The product was bought for me as a gift and it came in a huge set. I am disappointed and sad that my friend spent about 60 dollars for a cheap product with a short shelf-life. I am never buying perfume from Britney Spears. Obviously the makers of the perfume did not perform enough quality control tests before releasing the perfume.

I immediately fell in love with the fragrance, and my husband bought me the really big bottle.  I wanted to savor it, and make it last.  Much to my dismay it turned an ugly pee yellow and now smells like pure rubbing alcohol.  It also formed a nasty, crusty substance all over the pump and bottle.  I am soooo disappointed!!!

I received my Curious perfume not last christmas, but the christmas before.. and i was SO excited, i had already been through the shops at least 15 times just trying it on over and over, using every tester i could find.
when i got it, i was just as happy and used it just *so* carefully, i wanted it to last for years. 
i got the one that comes with the pump, the largest bottle.... anyway, 
i now look over to my dresser and see it sitting there. YELLOW.
my curious perfume
WENT
YELLOW
and apparently mine was not the only one that went bright yellow, my brothers girlfriends is also a lovely urine coloured yellow. 
it also grew a sticky coat of curious smelling...crud.. around the bottle and just today i went over to it, only to find it LEAKING all over my table... i squeeze the pump and it is rock hard... i look over to the nozzle and it is covered in a thick crust, the whole thing has crusted over and is leaking, i squeezed it again and  my curious perfume  splerted out..
it now smells off
and doesn't really look all that fantastic as you may have guessed.
i am DISGUSTED and so 
so angry
that perfume i wanted so bad and was so excited to get now sits on the table surrounded by it's own disgusting pool of crust and leaking hardened perfume (i didn't even know that was possible) 
i am disgusted
what a cheap nasty NASTY product.
do NOT buy it unless you think you're going to use it within a period of 1 year.

good work!
a product as cheap and nasty as the person endorsing it

When Curious came out, I smelled it and had to buy it. I acknowledged at the time that the bottle was probably half of the reason I bought it (unfortunately). The bottle is beautiful and attracts many customers by itself. The fragrance is very pretty and sweet. It goes on very strong but fades quickly, which it annoying. 
Also, maybe six months after I bought it, I noticed that it started smelling a little different. I left it in my bathroom for a while without moving it because of the difference. Today, I picked the bottle up and the sprayer was covered in this ....disgusting filmy substance, which had also dripped down the sides of the bottle and created a ring of filth on my countertop. It was really really gross. By the looks of it, the perfume had some sort of chemical reaction with the metal from the nozzle of the sprayer. 
Anyways, the whole bottle smells awful now and it's digusting. The bottle design was it's awful putrid demise, which ruined $50. It's really unfortunate too, because I loved the bottle and the fragrance when I got it and now it's junk

I had very high hopes for this cream, as it appears they went the extra mile for quality. Not so. The cream when used leaves alot of friction as the razor goes over your face, making for some tense moments that should not be there.
I have used many creams. So far Art of Shaving is the best. Casswell Massey is ok as is Aveda. Avoid Truefitt

OMG - if you decide to use this use it SPARINGLY!!!!  I can't stress it enough.  I decided to get the Philosophy acne kit because I had a few minor breakouts and clogged pores.  I had been using Clean &amp; Clear salicylic (sp?) acid products with no trouble so figured this wouldn't be much different.  Boy was I wrong!  The first week was great; week #2 the nightmare began... I wound up these huge, brownish-red, sore, swollen, itchy bumps/scabs on my face.  I have since stopped that portion of the treatment and am now moisturizing my face back to health.  Last night my bf said it looks better than the 'pizza face' from the Philosophy products.  Yikes!  Try at your own risk but take it slow

Never had I been so unhappy with my makeup as I was when I was using Clinique. I used Stay Beige (which I lightly patted on my face on top of Clinique's superfit liquid makeup - I have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. I also hated how Clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades, so that I had to settle for Honey in the liquid and Beige in the powder. As much as I went back to Macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades, they just wouldn't listen. Either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade, or they were convinced I was making a big deal out of nothing. Instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which I shouldn't have to do in the first place) I just switched to a different makeup line: Laura Mercier, which I am VERY happy with.

I've had many other friends who were unhappy with Clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand, as well. I'm not trying to knock the product. I'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people I know. I would definitely NOT recommend Clinique to anyone. I'd rather pay a little more and get better results rather than settle for a $20 product just because it's affordable.

I just purchased the small bottle(Thank God) of the Ojon ultra hydrating shampoo and conditioner.  It seems like it made my hair a little softer, but the smell is horrendous.  I have gotten the worst headache from the smell of this product. So overall it may make my hair feel softer, but there is no way I will put this stuff on my head again.  The rest is going in the trash

I do not like this shampoo at all. In fairness, I did give it two stars because it may not be good for coarse african american hair. It seemed to make my hair clump together and made it difficult to comb through when wet. The one thing that did detangle it however was the ojon hydrating conditioner which I do love.  Did have a pleasant scent and foamed up well

I can't believe how much amazon and other retail stores (like sephora)charge for this.  I buy Prevage MD (which is double the strength of regular Prevage) from my plastic surgeon's office and I only pay 120$.  Why would you pay 30 dollars more for something that is only half the strength of the good stuff?  If you don't want to go to the doctor to buy the MD version, then you can get it off ebay for around 100$..

I bought this product in the color Paparazzi from Sephora - online, I read wonderful reviews about it in the magazines.  I was very disappointed when I finally got it and tried it. There is way too much glitter in it for anyone over 13.  I could not wear this to work or even an evening out as I would feel like a clown.  The only place this would look semi-good at would be a nightclub where it is dark. I was hoping for more of a shimmer than pure glitter.  I do not recommend this product at all. I also returned this promptly back to Sephora.

I was looking forward to receiving this body lotion; however was very disappointed when I opened it and smelled the fragrance.

It smells exactly like paint.  Then after a few minutes it seems to just disappear with a faint paint-like scent.

I will not buy any more Philosophy products.  The less expensive fragrances/lotions are so much better that you buy from Target, Wal-Mart, etc

I love falling in love fragrance and the shower gel, but this lotion is not getting as much love from me. It doesn't smell the same to me, and on a bad day, makes me a little sick.  It's sweeter smelling.  Thing is, I need lotion, and I don't want competing scents.  Otherwise, I might have rated it even lower

Actually, I would give the product 5 stars, and the packaging a minus-2. CityLips really does work, plumping and hydrating; it does required repeated applications. BUT the packaging results in about 10-12% of the (expensive) material being completely unavailable!  Worse, if you try to wiggle the (too-short) applicator in order to get the last 10%, the container breaks at the neck (actually, one came already cracked in my case!).  True, they do offer some colors at 2/3 price, but most effective is to apply clear, and go outside the lipline-and the clear almost never has gone on sale!

I used two tubes in one month - one for daytime wear, and one for nighttime and when I wasn't going out (clear).  I like the product: how it looks and smoothes out my lips, but I just cannot afford to pay $60 a month on my lips!  If they lower the price by $10-12, I will buy it again......but not until they do :-

I am SO DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!! I ordered this scent after hearing about it from friends, and reading great reviews.  All of the reviews I read mentioned the lack of staying power that this product has, but I never expected the product to be so extraordinarily weak.  Don't get me wrong, I do not want my fragrance to enter a room before I do (after all, it is not the 80's anymore lol), but I also do not want to have to sniff my wrist so hard to detect the scent that I take off skin!  The scent is beautiful, I would love to wear it!  But 20 minutes after I sprayed it on, I could barely detect the fragrance.  As sometimes it is harder to "smell your own perfume", I asked my hubby and friends for their opinions.  They could barely smell it either.  I would happily wear this scent every day if I could enjoy it at all.  If Philosophy can create this scent with staying power, they will have a customer for life.  As it stands now, I would not recommend anyone buy this product.  It is a very disappointing waste of money

I am such a huge fan of the Philosophy Grace line that I thought I would really love this, too.  I find that it is much too light for me.  It does smell exactly like cotton candy which is nice, but it doesn't last long at all.  I guess I'll have to really spray a lot for anyone to even notice I'm wearing it.  Nobody has said anything so far.  The shower gel is a waste as far as scent goes...wonderful lather, but no smell to speak of.  I will stick with Amazing Grace, Baby Grace and Pure Grace.  Those are wonderful

I bought two Clarisonic brushes - one as a gift and one for myself.  Although the product works well, unfortunately, both brushes were defective.  The trouble started occurring about two months after using.  One brush started out with two speed settings, but eventually only functioned at the low setting.  The other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged!

My experience with the customer service has been terrible.  They would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty.  Be careful if you are going to travel abroad.  The warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v!

This perfume deserves negative stars. I was in Macy's when I saw this fragrance on the Dior counter. The bottle is gorgeous, and I really like Hypnotic Poison and Miss Dior Cherie, so I figured I would give this one a try. I really should have smelled directly from the bottle before spraying it on my skin. It is HORRIBLE. White floral scents are generally not my thing, but I can usually tolerate them. This was the worst perfume I ever smelled. It's way too powdery and it smells so cheap. I was stuck with it on my wrist all day and it kept making me sneeze. Disgusting. Not worth the money at all. If you want to buy this scent, I would recommend buying Dove Deodorant Spray instead. It's much cheaper and smells exactly the same. I wonder if it really is the Dove Deodorant but repackaged...hmm..

At first, it's a beautiful floral scent, then it dries to something that gives me a headache.  I cannot detect what smell it is, but it's not pleasant.  I cannot detect vanilla in this at all.

I was a little afraid to try this after reading some of the reviews, but the list of ingredients sounded wonderful so I gave it a try.  I love it!  It's surprising.  It changes.  On me, when I first put it on it takes on a white floral scent.  When I first applied it, I was surprised that it seemed like a floral".. but hours later I was smelling Vanilla.  I was very surprised to realize it was me!  VERY interesting! Very cool!  Lighter than the Original Poison, it may become my Spring/Summer choice

I loved the smell in the magazines so I decided to get it.  Well...it was good at first...and then I got tired.  It smells a little cheap and sort of like pine.  I sometiems use it, but let me tell you it smells good on your armpits (that's what I use it for).  

I think this smell reminds me of some kind of cologne that has been worn for tooo long

I bought this soap just to see what all the Philosophy hype is all about. I was not impressed. It smells just like ordinary soap-so what? The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it does lather well. You can get soap that smells better at Wal-Mart!

i saw this and bought it from qvc because they raved asbout how it moisturized thick curly/kinky hair. it didn't do anything for my hair and i didn't like the smell (but its not that big of a deal)--i returned it. i don't think its for coarse-kinky curls, but maybe for others textures.  

&amp;lt;for coarse 'naturals' try carol's daughter's healthy hair butter and khoret amen line

     Sorry to say I found this nail polish remover to be extremely drying, something I haven't experienced with other removers.

     In addition, it takes several applications to successfully remove just one coat of polish.  

      On the plus side, it's fragrance free and reasonable in price

I really wanted to like this but I find that my skin looked ashen and orangey after a couple of hours. When I went back to get a lighter color, it did the same. I think there's just too much yellow in this foundation. And considering it's oil-free, it didn't really keep the oils at bay and practically slid off my skin by midday.

I would suggest trying this first and wear it all day to see if it turns orange on you. Or if you're looking for a similar oil-free foundation, I would highly recommend Laura Mercier Oil-Free or Chanel DPF

As much as I LOVE Fat Girl Slim, I thought I'd try Serious Cellulite soap to go with it. I was not impressed at all. It has a terrible medicine like smell that lingers on you and after a few washes there are no more dimples on the soap. It was what I thought it would be at all. The size of the bar was good, the price is good, but I am not pleased at all with the quality

The texture of this cleanser is waxy.  I could barely get it off my face, and I broke out badly after using it.  I double checked the packaging to make sure it really was supposed to be a facial cleanser, and that I hadn't mistakenly put some other product on my face.  It smells wonderful, though.  I tried to think of alternate uses for the product, but finally threw it away

I haven't had an outbreak of acne in about 5 years until I started using this cream. I kept using it thinking that my huge cysts couldn't possibly be from this very pricey stuff. I went to the dermo and she said to stay away from these thick creams specifically for anti-aging because they are horrible for your skin. I went back to my cheap neutrogena lotion for anti- aging and it felt sooo much better and lighter and within a week my skin cleared up. I didn't even realize how very thick this stuff was until I started back on my neutrogena. I feel so bad about the $$$ I lost and I wish I would've gotten a sample first. I encourage you to do the same.

I was very unhappy with this product. First the shipping took way too long. Second, the tube is much smaller than sold at Macy's and the cost is more. And the contents were gross, very goopy. Not smooth. Like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months. I'll fight the mall to buy this next time

My sister-in-law bought this product for me after I had admired the shade (Purr, a light baby pink color) that she was wearing. I have used other MAC products before with great results, but was VERY dissapointed with this product. 

First of all, I gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. However, this product is sticky. VERY sticky! It does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. Not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. When I wear a lip gloss, I want to be soft and smooth feeling. I want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak. 

Also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. This will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. Very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!  

This product seems to be popular with other viewers, however, I would never reccomend this to anyone

I hate to say this since Philosophy is one of my favorite brands, but this is probably the worst mascara I have ever used. It clumps really badly and is very difficult to remove. It does not simply wash off, it forms little rubbery strings that end up all over your face and the bathroom sink. About half of them remain attached to your lashes, and I've pulled so many of mine out just trying to remove the mascara. Everything else I've ever tried from Philosophy was fantastic, but the best mascara out there, hands down, is from Lancome

This clarifying lotion is too harsh. I used it once and my skin is itchy, dry and red. I think I'm allergic to it. Basically, the chemicals in these products are really harmful. Most of the time, people don't need these products. All they do is clog up what nature has given us. This lotion is horrible

I purchased the entire 3-Step Clinique system including: 
Clinique Facial Soap with dish
Clinique Clarifying Lotion 2
Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion


About the same time I started using the Clinique 3-step system, I began wearing foundation for the first time. I found that my skin started breaking out and began to be dry in some spots. I stopped using the foundation after about 3 months because I thought that was the issue. However, my skin problems did not improve and I even moved down a level in the Clinique system to one for more sensitive skin.

However, after about 7 months of daily use, my skin was not improving and I found a review of the Clinique 3-step System from Paula Begoun. Her research indicates that all of Clinique's facial soaps in the 3-Step System are too irritating for all skin types. Her research also stated that all Clarifying Lotions (1-4) contain alcohol and Clarifying Lotion 2 contains menthol which make them too irritating for all skin types. 

I never thought that my skin care products were the cause of my flaky skin and break outs. Apparently, the products dried out my skin making it flaky in some areas and in response, my skin started producing more oil to compensate for the dryness-which made me break out in other areas. I switched to Paula's Choice facial products and I occasionally use Cetaphil. After I made the switch, my skin slowly began recovering. 

Unfortunately, now I have some acne scars on my cheeks as a result of using the Clinique 3-step system. It makes me sad because before, my skin was healthy and for the most part clear. I do want to be fair to Clinique. They have some great products---I use their City Block Sheer SPF 15, Advanced Stop Signs Eye SPF 15 and I wear Clinique Happy perfume which smells amazing. 

I hope this review proves helpful to other women so you don't have to go through what I went through! Clinique does have some great products in their line, but they do need to  reformulate their 3-Step Skin Care System.

I'm sorry but this is one of the worst perfumes.  I seriously can spray myself about 10 times and within 30 minutes you can't smell a thing.  yes the scent is great, I love it.  But the only person who has the opportunity to smell it is me.  Really really disapointed.  I guess I'm just used to the Channel and Ralph Lauren lines.  They are quality and can last most of the day.  This stuff is plan old junk like most of the new stuff coming out these days.

The Key to My Heart lipgloss chain is a very cute, original idea, but it fails to deliver the quality worthy of the Hard Candy name. The reviews here have all stated that this is a cute keychain, that the gloss is nice and that the colors are pretty. All very true. I got my keychain in the Pixie tones and they're girly and pretty and I was feeling pretty cool about it. However, for me, the disenchantment came with the mechanics of it. 

Now, I've always been a fairly careful person, I'm not klutzy nor do I drop or lose things. My keys are as normal as a standard set of keys can be, I never dropped them or banged them against stuff any more that's normal and yet, after less than a week the keychain hinges had broken twice. The first time I was able to make a little mess of superglue and scotch tape and managed to rescue it and put it back into almost normal condition, the second time however, I only noticed that the entire thing had fallen completely apart because I saw only half of the keychain remained and my keys were all covered in pink goo. 

How did it come apart like this? I honestly have no idea as my keys had only made the very normal trajectory between the ignition and my purse. I can honestly only chalk it up to really, really shoddy craftsmanship which may be adequate for a dresser-top lipgloss but never for something that could get even remotely more movement than that. It was a good idea but too low-quality to be fit for the purpose of a keychain. This is not the way to go for gloss on your keys

I love the smell of this perfume. However, it doesn't stay on. I have been wearing perfume for 18 years now and have used several different kinds without a problem. I was sold by SJP on this perfume when she appeared on Oprah. Loved it when I went to the counter at the mall to check it out. I have been using it for about 2 months now and it just doesn't last. About an hour after I put it on I (or my husband) can't smell it anymore. Trust me, I learned to apply it liberally and it still doesn't stay. Totally disappointed

As some people before me said already, this scent isn't THAT lovely. I am a SJP-fan, and I was almost certain I would love the new perfume of this stylish lady.
It isn't released yet in Holland, but I found a sample in Germany where it is already released. I was disappointed. The smell isn't bad, but it's isn't something I would like to smell like. It isn't lovely at all. It is too sporty. I expected something more flowery. The scent reminded me most of deodorant (cheap brands) or toilet-refreshener. So, although I am a SJP-fan, I wouldn't like to smell like her. A pity.
My favourite perfumes are (as a comparison): Beyond Paradise (Estee Lauder), Curious (Britney Spears), Couture! (Moschino), Live (J.Lo), Tumulte (Christian LaCroix), several Escade Limited Edition Perfumes and Gucci Rush 2

After hearing Oprah's rave reviews of this perfume, and seeing that it was one of her Favorite Things for 2005, I thought for sure I'd love it.  I ran right out to the nearest department store for a sample of it!  I just had to see for myself...

Well, I was NOT impressed.  The scent is so strong and overwhelming that it actually seemed to "catch" in my throat.  I accidentally got some on my hand and after four hand washings I could still smell it.  I guess, for those of you who like this perfume, that's probably a good thing.

Anyway, I think this perfume is too "old lady" for my taste.  It reminded me of J. Lo's Glow.  Which I also have and don't like.

For comparisons sake, perfumes I do like are Britney Spears' Curious, Clinique Happy, Escada Island Kiss and Lucky You

I bought this eyeliner expecting great things, and was sorely disappointed.  Application is difficult, mistakes are almost impossible to correct even if done immediately, and I can't soften the line (it *is* smudgeproof).  If you are used to a brush-on-liquid-liner, have a very steady hand, and want a dramatic look, this might work for you.  I prefer a softer line, so this didn't.

Also, it almost completely flaked off over the course of the day.

I'm giving it two stars because it really is smudge-proof, no sliding or transferring.  I didn't have the dark shadows from smudging but I did have flakes, so I'm still not happy with it.

This is definitely not worth the pricetag

My husband was revolted by the smell of this product.  I have bad sinuses, so it didn't bother me.  As far as effectiveness goes, there are no miracle ingredients in this concoction.  I used it everyday, several times a day, and noticed no lasting improvement in the look or feel of the skin on my hands.  At a cost of almost $20 for 8.5oz., I got skunked

Shiseido is known for creating top quality products that do not irritate even the most sensitive of skin. My mother and many of my friends mothers swear by their Benefiance line.  I cannot tell you how disappointed I am in their Pureness line. It is for oily/problem skin.  I have been using this for about 10 days and while it goes on nicely and has this wonderful, light, clean fragrance, it had made my skin even oilier.  I thought my skin just had to get acclimated to a new skincare regimen but this is not the case

I'm a huge fan of the majority of the Philosophy line, along with adoring the Amazing Grace scent!  I thought this scrub would be perfect for the spring into summer period because of the light floral scent.  Boy was I wrong!!  
If you love amazing grace, this smells Nothing like it.  IT smells like plastic flowers.. not appealing at all.  Even my fiance made a comment that the bathroom smelled like melting plastic.  If you want a fantastic exfoliator, try Gingerbread Man or the Margarita scrub.. those are devine!  I think I'll stick to my amazing grace body lotion from now on

This is one of the cutest shower caps I've owned, but it didn't keep my hair dry -- the cap kept sliding up my head.  Sephora's shower cap also did the same thing, but, at least, it only cost $5. So far, I've found the best shower caps are the complimentary ones I receive when I occasionally stay in a hotel.

The Philosophy states on their cosmetic's containers: there is no such thing as unblemished skin. Well, this is for sure true, when you use this Kit Kit. I have pictures to proove, that for more than a month of using Acne Kit Kit not even one acne spot dissapeared. I'm combining it with oxygen peel- this doesn't help either. I was as happy as young horse to have all this products for around $40: night and day cream, facial wash and blemish serum. All they do ( maybe except of the wash) is drying out the skin. Soon I have had to buy super-moisturizing revitalizing night cream and sensitive skin, high spf day cream( my skin started showing dark, sun-exposure spots, altough I WAS USING an spf filter) and finally no acne was or is gone. I dont get it- I was having better results using $0,97 hydrogen peroxide after toner than this hydrogen peroxide- based line of cosmetics. For the same price I could have bought stuff that really works-the one that Vanessa Williams is happy with. I know cause I tried it, didn't make my skin feel like Sahara and will be my next choice. Save your money. P.S. The oxygen peel is O.K. dough

I sprayed a tester sheet at a perfume counter with this scent.  After shopping a bit, I went back and decided to buy it.  It's nice and light, but after wearing it for the first time, I realized it's TOO light.  I couldn't even smell it when I held my wrist to my nose.  The second time, I decided to apply more.  I must've used 6-7 sprays and still, only a lingering aroma.  For the amount you have to use and the faintness of the scent, I wouldn't recommend it

I read the label, and it is not a rare, tropical oil at all, but plain old American palm oil!  False advertising really bothers me.  It did condition my hair well, but I agree that the fragrances (which are added to it, by the way) make the odor very strong and unpleasant.  The price is also very high.  I will not order this again

I bought this stuff from the Shopping Channel, and thought it wasn't bad, until I went to get my hair colored. 
The color didn't take!
My hair is shoulder length, and I only used the Ojon on the bottom 5 or 6 inches, because that's the part that was dry. 
The color only took on the 'new growth', not on the rest of my hair - the hair that I had put the Ojon on! 
The smell of the oil, the shampoo, or the conditioner didn't bother me, but the HAIR SPRAY was disgusting. People remarked that I had overdosed on perfume, so I had to wash it again to get the rotten smell out of my hair.
I definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone who colors their hair.

This is a hit or miss product. I ordered a 5 oz jar and while the smell is nauseating (burnt coffee/caramel/cigarettes), the product did work for a while. My extremely dry, curly hair was soft and shiny but then the product became too heavy for my hair and stopped working. I would save my money and experiment with other oils such as coconut, jojoba, almond, avocado before shampooing or after. I adjusted my hair routine by using a natural shampoo and conditioner and adding jojoba oil to my curl cream and it has never been happier. If you do want to try the product, ask the company to send you samples or find a store that sells them.

Although it is great others love this product, I did not get that same streak of good luck. I had been using Clinique for years, merely because it was affordable and a lot of people I knew used it. However, every time I took pictures I couldn't help but cringe after I saw the way my face looked. I'm a naturally tan person, but when I wore Clinique's foundation (I used Honey 07) it would make my face look extremely pale and ghostly, compared to the rest of my body. It got to the point where I got so upset that I went back to the Clinique counter at Macy's and insisted this just couldn't be the right color for me. They insisted it was the correct color and didn't even bother trying new shades on me, even though I had gone back a couple different times. 

Overall, I was really miserable with this product. As a lady, I want to look my best. I definitely don't want to look like someone who doesn't know how to put her makeup on, but whenever I took pictures and saw the way I looked, I couldn't help but think everyone was thinking that. 

For those of you who may be having my same problem, I recommend switching over to Laura Mercier. I made the switch and it's been the best makeup decision of my life. My face has never looked better

I will admit, I am a sucker for hair products. I have very thick hair, that at times, can be a little wild.  I have used Fekkai products before, and their okay.  Certainly not worth the over inflated price tag.  But I read the reviews for this product and thought it might be the perfect solution for my hair during the winter months.  Wrong answer!  This product is very thick, too thick for me to spread through my hair without putting some work into it.  Conditioners and hair masks should be well, conditioning.  I left this hair mask in the required 20 minutes, and it did nothing.  In fact, I had to go back through my hair with my $6.00 Pantene conditioner just to make my hair manageable.  I also have to wonder what the purpose is of putting pieces of nut shells into a product that is supposed to condition hair?  All those pieces are going to do is rough up your hair cuticle.
Ladies, spend your money on a book that reviews hair products! I did and I've realized that ALL hair products are essentially the same.  Only the name and perfumes change.  Read Paula Begoun's book about hair products

I have dry, fine, easlily tangled color-treated hair and thought this sounded like the answer. I was surprised to read the other comments since, for me, this just plain didn't work. My hair was as dry and frazzled as before I used it. I have better luck with conditioners that don't have to be left on for nearly as long a time. I recently discovered a great conditioner from my hairdresser called Bonacure which works in a few minutes and leaves my hair in great condition, shiny, managable and detangled. And for a mask I tried Keratase and it was fantastic and the consistancy made it easier to use and my hair was silky smooth and stronger. I really thought this would be amazing for any type of damaged hair but it wasn't the right choice for me. Maybe I would have had more luck with Fekkai's glossers

I have been using Frederic Fekkai's glossing cream for a few years now and love it so I thought I would try the luscious curls.  It was very thick, which may be a good thing since there is so little of it, but doesn't spread through hair very well.  It left my hair a little crunchy, and the crunchiness didn't go away for a few hours.  When it did dry, i felt that my curls just kind of hung there, without much body or shine.  I have used Loreal's Professional line prior to this and I will definitely go back to it.  It's cheaper, better quality, and twice the size of luscious curls.

Another disappointed customer. 

I have very thick, coarse, wavy hair and trying to manage it is a nightmare! Before using Fekkai's Luscious Curls lotion, I was using Aveda's Be Curly Lotion and Matrix's Curl.Life contouring creme. Both of the latter products work very well with my hair. I don't like to blow dry my hair (too time-consuming), so I just air dry it. Without blow drying, whether I'm using Aveda or Matrix, the results are great! My hair is smooth, shiny, and less frizzy.

I had never used Fekkai's products before, but decided to give this one a try. Everything Luscious Curl Enhancing Lotion claimed to do, didn't do for my hair. In fact, it actually made my hair worst! It became stiffer, drier looking, frizzier. In addition, my wavy hair, (usually bouncy and alive), became flat and dull. Also, I didn't like the scent of this particular curling lotion. It was very strong smelling and made me nauseous.  

Because of my very poor experience with Fekkai's Luscious Curls lotion, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I think I'll stick to the Aveda and Matrix curling lotions, since they are much more compatible with my hair.

I've been using this product for almost 2 months and I have seen NO difference whatsoever in the appearance of my dark circles.  And yes, it does burn!  The only thing I'm glad about is that I bought it from eBay cheaper than it normally sells elsewhere.  
I've had dark under-eye circles all my life.  I suppose I should just learn to live with them and save my money.  I will not be wasting my money on this product again

I've been using this product for about two weeks now and I haven't seen the slightest change in the dark circles under my eyes. I don't know how long you have to use it before you see a difference, but I don't think it's going to show any change in the dark circles. Personally I think I wasted my money. I don't think theres anything on the market that can help dark circles under the eyes.

I gave it two stars because unlike another anti DHT shampoo I tried, this one didn't strip my hair of all oil in one application and make it frizzy.  That is where my praise stops because it smells medicated and funky.

To the people that make this stuff:  My hairline is starting to recede and the last thing I need is to reek of funky old guy smell at age 40!  I would rather continue losing my hair than smell like the 80 year old guy wearing lime green checkered pants.  What part of this don't you people understand?  If you didn't do market research that aspect of it then it makes me wonder about the research done on whether it even works

I used the entire tube faithfully as a face cream over the course of several months.  While I thought it moisturized fine, I did not notice any change in my lines, tone, texture.  For the money I'd go get several tubes of the Neutrogena anti-aging products - they work better, have a nicer texture and smell MUCH better

I used this product for a couple of months with no visible result. In addition it's quite greasy and since it's not made to be used on the face, we can understand that. But that makes it very hard to use along with sunscreen and whatever makeup one chooses.

But I won't buy this again. It smells good and dipping it into one of the Bare Escentual powders to make a lipstick is neat. But the product doesn't really moisturize my lips and I haven't found a color I like on my lips once I dip this into a Bare Escentuals powder. 

I won't be buying this again, I will probably just try a lip gloss next time

The texture of this product is fine, but not really better than anything you can get at the drugstore, therefore overpriced. 

Now, if the flavor and scent were exceptional it might be worth the high price tag, but it doesn't smell that great. It smells rather like over cooked coffee beans.

The Bare Escentuals Soy Mocha SPF 15 has a much nicer smell and texture, if you're wanting a Bare Escentuals product

My mom had bought their darkest shade and after applying it, it was obvious that she was wearing reddish dark brown eyebrow pencil. It didn't blend in at all, it stood out against her black eyebrow hairs. So I bought her an eyebrow pencil from Yves Saint Laurent in #5. That one is perfect, not too black and not too brown

I'm very disappointed with the results. I am fairly young, 31. I have very fine lines and i thought this would make them disappear. It really didn't do anything to my skin. Plus it is greasy and has an unpleasant smell. I do not recommend this

I have been using this product for about a month and all it's done is given me puffy eyes. There is no proof that this product works at all and the FDA has even written the makers of this product a warning letter to stop making false claims that it helps stretch marks and wrinkles. 

I've used Botox before and believe me, Botox works, this product doesn't, so obviously it's not better than Botox. 

I bet the people who gave it 5 stars either work for the company or are fictional entities created by the Basic Research marketing department so that the product seems better than it actually is

I used the entire tube faithfully as a face cream over the course of several months. While I thought it moisturized fine, I did not notice any change in my lines, tone, texture. For the money I'd go get several tubes of the Neutrogena anti-aging products - they work better, have a nicer texture and smell MUCH better.

As for "better than botox"  - buyer beware when you hear this line

One, I don't think this is better than botox.  Botox works instantly and more dramatically, but it's more expensive.  However, when you think about how much you're spending on this strivectin, applying it every day for the rest of your life, you could get botox (yes, you need to get more botox every several months, but the costs are about the same).  Not only that, but botox simply works better.  However, if you just can't afford botox, then I would buy Rulinea FX which is the exact same ingredients as Strivectin, but half the price, it's available on HSN.co

I'm pretty sad about this one, especially because of the cost.  I'm 34, with decent skin but some of the typical lines starting around the eyes, forehead, lip line, etc.  My skin does tend toward oily yet sensitive at times, if that context helps any of you out.  A friend of mine all of a sudden looks 10 years younger, beautiful, glowing poreless skin without needing any foundation so I asked her what she was using.  This was one of her key products and she said it took about 2 months for the effect to really be noticeable.  

Unfortunately I can't use it enough to find out.  First I tried appplying it around my eyes, on my forehead and above my upper lip.  I broke out in really deep cystic acne in those areas after about 4 days.  I started relegating the application only to the eye area and even that is now having a horrible reaction.  I look like I've got insect bites under my eyes, or like I've been punched out.  Yuck.  It's gotta be some kind of allergic reaction.  It works so beautifully for my friend, I guess I'll be giving it to her to finish

I used Stryvectin religously for two months and one week - more than double the recommended time to get some results - and it has made no more difference to my skin than regular moisturizer. I used it for fine lines on my face and thicker lines on my neck and forehead. To determine if it really worked, I decided to use it experimentally by applying it to the left side of my face only - every day as suggested on the packaging. After all this time, I cannot see the slightest difference between the left side of my face and the right side, and nor can any of my friends. I got better results on my neck when I was using Shiseido neck cream which is a third of the price. I would not buy Stryvectin again

Never had I been so unhappy with my makeup as I was when I was using Clinique. I used Stay Beige (which I lightly patted on my face on top of Clinique's superfit liquid makeup - I have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. I also hated how Clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades, so that I had to settle for Honey in the liquid and Beige in the powder. As much as I went back to Macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades, they just wouldn't listen. Either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade, or they were convinced I was making a big deal out of nothing. Instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which I shouldn't have to do in the first place) I just switched to a different makeup line: Laura Mercier, which I am VERY happy with.

I've had many other friends who were unhappy with Clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand, as well. I'm not trying to knock the product. I'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people I know. I would definitely NOT recommend Clinique to anyone. I'd rather pay a little more and get better results rather than settle for a $20 product just because it's affordable.

I have to be honest.  I bought in to all the hype of mineral make-ups.  My sister uses the bare essentials and her skin looked flawless and she has uneven tones like I do.  I didn't want to pay the price or join the club so I tried Pur MInerals.  I still had to use a "cover-up" under my eyes and blemishes and had to put pur minerals on rather heavy to get the "flawless" look.  But then it looked too powdery.  I started using my regular cover-girl foundation and powder again as I felt it covered better and less heavy.  Just a note, my sister said she still uses a "Cover up stick" when using bare essentials too, but she looked beautiful in it

This product did nothing for my t-zone. I was still very shiney and oily by mid-day. I recommend Benefit's Dr. Feelgood.

I gave this product two stars because though it didn't control oil for me, it didn't feel heavy or clog my pores

This product costs 10 times more then a regular gel.  But it does not even work as well as a regular shaving gel.  Its like putting a thin layer of soap on you face.  It did not help at all. No doubt the people who marked this up one thousand present are the geniuses in the Marketing Department, because, it fooled me just like it fooled everyone; $$$18 FOR A GEL! IT MUST BE more effective, "I'll give it a try". There is a sucker born every day.

I love coconuts, and would love it if this made my hair smell like coconuts.  Instead, my hair smells like burnt coconuts.  Or even burnt newspaper.  The conditioning qualities of the product aren't good enough (and it certainly isn't cheap enough) to make me purchase this again.  At least not until I develop a hankering for smokey-smelling hair

It smells great, like coconut.  I have long curly hair, and it made my hair dry and brittle.  I've noticed this with all of the LUSH conditioners I've tried, so I would not recommend it for naturally curly hair.  2 stars for the great smell

HI
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
There are much better products by LUSH.

I got a free sample of this conditioner and used it along with LUSH's Trichomania solid shampoo.  At first I really liked it, but throughout the day, my hair felt like it was getting oilier.  I'm not sure if it was the Trichomania or the Coolaulin, but I gave both away to my friend who likes coconut.  The smell wasn't my favorite either (I'm not a coconut person), but if you like coconut, you will love the shampoo and the conditioner.

As for me, I will stick to American Cream and Rehab.

**UPDATE**
December 21, 2005
I tried the Coolaulin conditioner again, and my hair didn't get oily at all.  I'm not sure what happened the first time I tried it, but it was fine this time around.  I'm not a coconut person, so this conditioner is still not my fave (American Cream!!), but I do want to add on TWO stars and make the rating *~*FOUR STARS*~* because the conditioner made my hair really soft

I found this product did absolutely NOTHING for me...granted I don't have huge wrinkles, but the few I do have certainly got no better and i'm wondering if it made them worse! I wish I had asked around from friends, cause if I had I would have discovered this on my own without wasting the money. I'm wondering a couple of things, what all the fuss is about with strivectin? Is it just that everyone is different and some people have good results and some don't? AND is there anyone out there who can recommend a product that REALLY works? (if it works i don't mind spending the money...

I usually enjoy products by Philosophy but this stuff is not worth washing the family Xolo with, amigo. Trust me. This stuff STINKS! If a margarita is what you are craving, then stop in at the local Don Pablo's at lunchtime. Not only does this stuff smell bad on the skin, but, as the bottle warns, using this product can cause irritation to the skin and the urinary tract. Not good.

I will say one good thing about this product: it made the drains in my home smell lime-fresh for days after having poured the entire contents down them.

I quickly realized while in the shower that I don't want to smell like a margarita all day.   It does lather well and I don't find the smell to overpowering but it's not that special.   Warning to those of us that chemically treat our hair, this product as a shampoo is very drying and strips color out of hair.

I can't say enough about philosohpy, but I read another review recomending not to get the mimosa scent because it smells like the tang drink, so I purchased the margarita instead.  I hate to say it, but it is probabloy about the same for this product.  It smells so much like kool-aid that I can't use it. The smell is way to sweet.  I am a big margarita fan, but this smells nothing like it!  Just a caution

Any manufacturer that doesn't fully label their product should not be trusted. I do not see a list of ingredients here (but most nail polishes don't bother to do this anyway). The problem I see is this...this nail polish totes that it's safe to use during pregnancy due to the fact that it doesn't contain the above ingredients, but what DOES it contain instead? If it wears well, doesn't peel, give good color coverage, it's got to contain something in the offending ingredient's place, logically. 

Please ask yourself this before you sigh relief and Add to Basket! Phthalates, for example, are a class of industrial plasticizers that were invented in the 1930s. They are often used in nail polish because they make nail polish flexible, and they are used in other products because they help bleed the chemicals of fragrances and help lotion better penetrate the skin. They aren't required to be labeled on the products. Lab animals given dibutyl phthalate had higher numbers of offspring with birth defects, especially of the male reproductive system. A nail polish may not contain phthalates (and brag about it), but may contain a related plasticizer that essentially is just as harmful. Does this contain phthalic anhydride, a toxic chemical hardener? How about FD&amp;C color, such as Yellow 5? It's a petroleum-based color that is also questionable when it comes to safety. 

Basically put, no nail polish is safe during pregnancy. On top of that, while your at it you should review every lotion, foundation product, etc that you use if you're concerned about things like this. I think it's great to be careful - more power to you - but be fully informed, not partially. Companies prey on our worst fears, and what is worse than harming our babies? If this product is so great, let's see an ingredients list (and all cosmetics should do the same, while I'm sounding off on the subject!)

I have to be pretty honest - I was excited to get this kit, but so far I've been disappointed.  Maybe I'm not getting the whole technique down, but I find the diagrams pretty generalized and the powder flakes everywhere it isn't supposed to (like under my eyes, making them look very raccoon-y and tired--and when wearing smoky eyes, I figure you probably want everything else to look pretty bright in comparison to the dramatic eye effect).  Maybe I can't pull of the look or maybe I'm not applying it correctly, but either way, it always ends up looking like a big, dark, glittery mess...I'm a big Bare Escentuals lover, but I was disappointed with this product.

Didn't like this product. All of the actual "scrub" (salt) is at the top and minimal.  Felt like I would've been better off mixing some olive oil and actual sea salt to give myself a good scrub.  It did smell nice and I like the packaging

I enjoyed using this product because I liked the tingling from the mint - not necessarily a good thing, actually rather meaningless to the appearance and cleanliness of my face.  The Kaolin and Bentonite are drying agents, peppermint is harsh on sensitive skin.  If you separate out the so-called natural ingredients, you are left with the same basic stuff that any other cosmetics company uses.  And if it doesn't come straight out of the ground, it ain't natural anymore!  I give it a 2 because I was a sucker for the tingling, not because I saw any improvement in my skin's texture, look, or feel

Well i dint like the smell at all, i see nothing lovely about this perfum, if ur looking for a good perfume to give this holiday season, check out Fantasy by Britney Spears it smells so nice, or Curious by Britney thats a classic its a must give or have, J.Lo's Live smells really nice too so if i was you i would rather not buy it if ur giving it as a present,or for urself its not really worth ur money!

I have oily &amp; blemish prone skin and I was told by my Mother, who used to work for the Clinique/Estee Lauder family, to give their products a try because they are supposed to be non-cosmogenic. This product irritated my skin so much that I just had to rinse it off to relieve the itchiness. The only reason why I used it more than once was because it was supposed to leave behind a tingling sensation to show if it was working. If it was working, it hurt like hell and it made my face break out with more acne than I ever had all at once. Not worth your money

I love trying out new products for my hair and also happen to have slightly thinning hair on the top of my head (with receding corners).  After seeing this set at Sephora I tried it for a week and found the results mediocre. 

My hair, which is thin and not very abundant, did feel slightly thicker and had a plump look at the roots (especially the crown) but I am sensitive to smell and didn't like the man's cologne like scent.  The shampoo lathers up nicely but the conditioner is dense and doesn't spread well over the hair.  The mouse is interesting.  It definitely seems to make a difference in volume.  The overnight liquid makes hair a bit messy to sleep in.  

As is the case with any product, it may work for you but it didn't for me.  I believe in changing the body/hair from the inside out works better than rubbing niacin (vitamin b) topically to the scalp and hair.

I would recommend you try it.  You can always return it if you're not satisfied

I love Clinique products in general, but I don't like the soap in the liquid form ... it has a strong chemical smell to it and I find myself holding my breath while washing my face.  I much prefer the bar soap, and wouldn't buy the liquid again, for all that it seemed much more convenient.  No complaints on cleaning-ability

This product might be better on oily skin with no make-up. The point of it was lost on me. It may create a barrier between treatment products/moisturizer and make-up but it did nothing to perfect my skin. In fact when I touched my face I could feel make-up pilling and rolling off. It has a dry, heavy feeling to it. Don't use too much and be careful about dry patches. I thought it would make a better canvas of my skin. I now use Laura Mercier's primer which goes on light and smooth and gives a healthy glow. I didn't like the formulation of Philosophy's product at all

I normally like warm, sensual-type perfumes, but I wanted to try something different for a change.  I liked the fact that this is advertised as subtle and not perfumey.  Well...I have to disagree.  I think it is VERY perfumey and not subtle at all. To me it has a very sharp, high-toned scent which is almost acrid. I thought at first that maybe I had sprayed too much on, so I tried just a little spritz.  Still VERY strong and sharp. And I agree with the comparison to dead flowers and dryer sheets.  I will definitely not be ordering this again.

I know this is Philosophy's big seller, but I hate the way it smells.  It reminds me of those old ladies that bathe in their fragrance and make everyone around them nauseous.  My husband hated it too, as did my son.

I like the comments about it smelling like dead flowers and a dryer sheet.  That is about as close as it gets.

If you want a good Philosophy scent, go with Falling In Love, Pure Grace or Philosophy - the scent.  All of them are better than Amazing Grace.

I don't care to smell like a perfumy granny, thank you.  I'll stick with my Falling In Love

I love chocolate
I love dark chocolate, especially for my drinking chocolate.
I should have been suspicious when on the label it says you can make pudding from this as well...which should have alerted me right off the bat that there are other ingredients in the tin--not just chocolate and some sugar...it must be cornstarch.

Marie Belle makes a big deal of the fact that this is NOT cocoa, but cacao...that's why I fell for the hype...but in the end, it's the flavor that counts, and this one...I guess because of the corn starch...has a strange "mouth feel" and flavor that I find unpleasant.

I find the French brand  L'Ancienne  far superior...and my favorite drinking chocolate is 
Charbonnell et Walker, which is not for sale (yet) on Amazon

I'm going to Europe and thought this would save me time in the mornings (and maybe nerves, since I'm traveling with two women and no doubt towels will be in short supply!). But this thing is hard to use, the instructions are poorly drawn, and apparently I have the head of a giant - the button and the button latch (which isn't easy to find and isn't identified in the directions) don't stay together due to my ginormous noggin. The reason I chose this specific product to try was because it was pink and would be clearly different from regular hotel towels and because of the cute tube case - I thought it would pack easily. The material itself seems to work (she says as it slides, yet again, down her forehead to cover her eyes). After twenty minutes of wrestling with this cuddly little critter, I concede. Similar items may work, just not this one

I read many positive reviews on Pure Grace and decided to try it since I love a fresh, clean scent.  I was very disapointed when I used it, as it reminded me of Jean nate, which to me is an old lady smell.  It was more musky than clean smelling.  I couldn't smell any hint of feminine sweetness or floweriness to it.  It smelled like scented musky water with a sesemee oil...that is the only way I can describe it

I am dissatisfied with Lush's claims that many of its products, like this one, are natural.  I encourage buyers who are looking for products made with natural ingredients to carefully read the ingredients in Lush's products.  I have yet to see a Lush product that does not contain chemicals of questionable safety.  There are numerous other brands of truly all-natural soaps and shampoos that work excellently

As a huge fan of Pink Sugar and an avid chocolate fanatic, I was ecstatic to try out Chocolovers.  Since they don't sell Chocolovers anywhere near where I live I decided to order it from Sephora.com in the US.  First of all I thought the price was fairly reasonable for 1.7oz bottle (a very nice bottle and package, if I might add), it cost me around $50 CDN.  I was so excited when my order came in today that I quickly opened up the bottle and gave it a sniff.  Ahhh the sickeningly sweet smell of disappointment.  I don't know what I had been expecting, maybe something more like milk chocolate, but what I got was a strong citrus/cocoa powder burst fading into a VERY strong and sweet smell almost like turkish delights or raspberries and chocolate with a hint of musk.  This may sound good, but for as much of a fan of sweet candy/foody smells as I am, I found this one too overpowering and it seriously made me sick.  Right now all I can smell is a sickly sweetness and the smell of flat Seven Up.  On the plus side it has stopped completely my cravings for sweets.  I think if I were trying to diet I would wear this scent everyday.  I think I will keep it in the hopes that it will grow on me because I really love the look of the bottle and the box it came in.  I am also going to try and layer it with a cocoa body lotion in hopes that it will tame down some of the sweetness.  The bottom line is try before you buy

I've had this dryer for almost a year now, and like the styists who also own it, I find it temperamental. It does a great job while it's working, but the thermostat gets progressively buggier after about three months. If you turn the dryer off, you'll have to wait for it to cool completely before it will turn back on. Now, it turns off while I'm in the middle of doing my hair. The stylists have three or four of these so they can alternate working with one while the other(s) cool off - as I said, when they work, they're terrific. I'm going to replace mine with another brand

If you order this kit, make sure you have time to practice with it!  It takes several practice applications to get the shade just right.  While it does cover completely, it is not flawless. You can tell that you've covered something up on your skin.  If it's not a big deal, you might just want to leave your tattoo visible instead of having a big discolored spot or have someone who is really good with colors and makeup cover it for you with this kit

I love Philosophy products and own much of the skin care line.  I consider Purity facial cleanser a must have.  I was excited to try the hair care line and was so disappointed after using it.  I thought maybe I should give it a good shot and use it a few times to see if it got better with repeated use.  It doesn't.  It is among the worst shampoos I have ever tried.  It's almost worse than the cheapy store bought brands that you use in dire straits.  It instantly left my hair hard and brittle feeling and I couldn't wait to slather the conditioner on.  Even after condiditioning, my hair was lifeless and tangled easily!    The poor quality of this product actually made me doubt the entire Philsophy line

I bought two Clarisonic brushes - one as a gift and one for myself.  Although the product works well, unfortunately, both brushes were defective.  The trouble started occurring about two months after using.  One brush started out with two speed settings, but eventually only functioned at the low setting.  The other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged!

My experience with the customer service has been terrible.  They would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty.  Be careful if you are going to travel abroad.  The warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v!

After having great success with the Merkur Classic I decided to own up and get the Futur.  I was super excited because I thought to myself, "shoot, one pass instead of two..."  Not quite.  For starters the razor is bulking and plain heavy.  And not the kind of heavy I'm comfortable with trying to shave as I shouldn't feel I might drop the darn thing.  I started on 1 the first day to get a handle on the razor.  Not a good shave, missed alot of spots and patches of hair.  So day two I went to level 2 on the razor.  Same story, second verse.  It left patches and didn't shave well in some areas.  2.5 the areas got smaller but still...they were there.  Went to a 3 setting on the razor and almost mangled myself.  So for the next week I went back to a 2.5 and did it more consistantly, still gave me a crappy shave.  I give this one star because if it's supposed to be a better razor than anything before it, there shouldn't be a learning curve from one double edge to another.  At least not one this severe.  I get a way better shave using my merkur classic and I really think at least for me, this is the way to go.  I say use caution on the Merkur Futur.  I also say if you're already getting a good shave with a double edge you have, don't buy a new style for the sake of buying a new style.  If you're double edge gets old...buy a new one of the same kind.  Only a suggestion.

I ordered this for fun and have since decided that it's definitely not for me in any way. It's very drying on my skin, even though it's thick and creamy. The label says it's award-winning, but doesn't state what award it's received (if any!). I fail to see what might warrant it being award-winning. The scent smells like plastic or cheap strawberry candy. Also, it's absurdly priced given the quality. I've tried a few Philosophy items and need to just stop buying them because I'm always disappointed.

I'm with everyone else when they say they were diappointed by this product. I opened this bottle, expecting a totally yummy scent but what I got was nothing like what I expected! When I read that it smelled the Nesquick, I thought I'd like it anyway, because I love Strawberry Nesquick. But this stuff smells like...well, I can't describe it. All I know is I wish I hadn't paid $16 for it. Live and learn, I guess
Perhaps the Strawberry Ice Cream 3-in-1 gel smells better. Off topic, why do they have a Strawberry Milk Shake 3-in-1 gel And a Strawberry Ice Cream 3-in-1 gel? Wouldn't they smell just the same

My experience with this brush has been terrible.  Well, the first two or three days were wonderful.  By the third day, the brush was shedding bristles like mad into my razor.  By the second week, the wooden handle (which does look durable) cracked and the plastic sleeve that holds the bristles popped out--never to go back in again.   I am replacing this brush, sadly, after about 15 uses, and I will be purchasing a more expensive brush, I hope with better results.
***Update, a few months later:  I didn't replace the brush.  I super-glued the bristle-sleeve back into the wooden handle.  It eventually stopped shedding bristles, and I have used it successfully since then.  The wooden handle still looks like it will deteriorate quickly as the finish continues to chip off.  Still not recommended, since I don't think I should have to repair a product within the first few weeks of use

I purchased this shampoo for my daughter after she read rave reviews in a teen magazine.  She has thick, blonde hair and it was dry from summer heat, pool water, and light styling.  After trying the rehab shampoo, she was so disappointed that it did nothing to help her hair.  She said that while it lathered nicely, it felt like it stripped her hair and when it rinsed out, it left her hair overly 'squeeky' and tangled.  The end result once her hair was dried (after using conditioner, too), was that it was a lighter shade of blonde, very fly-away, and dry feeling.  She was hoping for smoother, easier to manage hair.  We debated purchasing this shampoo because of its high cost, and I have to say we are extremely disappointed.  The claims were hype, and the results were not delivered.  Her hair was by no means 'fried' or severely damaged, so I fully expected her to have some more manageable locks after using the product, based on its claims.  I will say that I bought her a shampoo and condition at the drug store that has helped dramatically.  It is Thermasilk Smooth &amp; Silky line, and it works wonders over Rehab for a fraction of the cost.  Save your money on this one

It was hard to apply (I accidentaly sprayed it in my hair and in the air) and what I did manage to get on my face, it did not cover much.  For the price they wanted this is unexcusable.  I promptly returned my Airflash and got my money back.  I do not recommend this product.

I have noticable undereye cirlces and bought this product in the hopes it you lighten them a bit.  I use this product in the mornings and evenings for several weeks. Nothing changed.  I figured maybe it would take more then a few weeks to notice anything so I continued to use this product (use the entire jar, just to give it plenty of time), still not difference could be seen. For me it was a waste of money.

I had one stubborn blackhead at the corner of my lip that compelled me to order this. It did work remarkably well on that blackhead, but then I couldn't leave well enough alone. I must have messed up my pores, because now for the first time IN MY LIFE (I'm 29), I have acne on my chin. The chin is the only place I used this tool (other than that initial blackhead) and now it's one problem after another. Not just whiteheads either, cysts that are inflammed and itchy! The only thing that I've done differently with my skin routine is use this, and it's caused me nothing but problems. Leave the pore unclogging to a professional; you're opening up quite a can of worms if you take this upon yourself.

One of my former roommates used to have Kerastase Nutritive Shampoo for very dry hair.  I remember it smelling great and being endorsed by celebrities as the "it" shampoo for treating dry, unruly tresses. The other day, I saw this shampoo on the clearance shelf at Meijers and regrettably made an impulse purchase.  Even at clearance price, this shampoo was still expensive. 

I have very thick, wavy, and somewhat dry hair that needs lots of conditioning products--when I checked out the ingredients (after I bought the shampoo), I groaned inwardly. Almost all of the ingredients (with the exception of water) is on the Aubrey Organics' "ingredients to be avoided" list (that is, they are considered toxic).  Like Aubrey Organics, other reputable natural beauty manufacturers suggest avoiding parabens as preservatives because they are mildly estrogenic and can be absorbed through the skin. This shampoo has six different types of parabens--methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc.     

If a product has such a steep asking price, then you would think that its manufacturers would put forth a better formula, incorporating non-toxic, natural ingredients (like Aveda, Biolage, and Biosilk).  At least Suave and V05 (bargain-priced shampoos) can boast about having vitamins and silk amino acids in their formulas (though many of their other ingredients are also found on the "to be avoided" list).

I received this free from Sephora as a birthday present because I signed up as a Beauty Insider.  I gave it to my neice for her 7th birthday and she likes it, but there's no reason this product should cost $16.  I'm betting the ingredients, packaging &amp; shipping costs don't total more than $3.  I wouldn't buy it.

I bought this and shortly after I started using it the sides of my noise started swelling up and peeling. I didn't know what was going on and I stopped using it and it immediately went away.. as soon as I started wearing it again the swelling and pain came back.
I am a person who doesn't break out very often and I can tolerate many products.
I now have a permanent red mark on the right side of my nose and it hasn't faded yet. I tried to take it back to nordstrom and they wouldn't exchange it.
This product sucks and as it was the only one I was using I know thats what caused the swelling.

My fiance' left this bottle of Prada on top of her jewelry box and the next time she went to use it, IT WAS EMPTY !!!  Seems the perfume was siphoned up and into the atomizer (pump sprayer) and then it ALL LEAKED OUT and down the bottle "glueing" itself to the jewelry box.  Now we have an EMPTY BOTTLE OF PRADA and A RUINED FINISH on the top of the jewelry box. I have sent Sephora an email explaining what had happened, but have not heard back from them. Beware of where you keep this bottle !!!

This is, hands down, the worst perfume I have ever smelled. If you're in the mood to smell sexy, don't wear this. If you're in the mood to smell girlish, don't wear this. If you're in the mood to smell classy, don't wear this. In other words, I have no idea what kind of mood you have to be in to actually want to wear this. I literally went around work asking twenty coworkers what they thought, and they all agreed this was awful. The only person I can imagine wearing this is a senior citizen. It just smells terrible and drab.. and it wasn't that I got a bad bottle either, I've smelled it in stores and it's the same. Truly terrible

I bought the ultra hydrating shampoo, conditioner, and the treatment, oh and also the hairspray.  These products dried my hair out horribly and weighed it down.  I gave it 2 weeks because it was so expensive and after two weeks my hair never has looked any worse!  I have naturally wavy, thick coarse hair and this made my hair unmanageable - like a helmet head.  My hair had no movement, no shine--just made it very heavy and weighed down.  Last night I used a hair purifier shampoo that gets gunk, minerals, etc out of your hair and after that I deep conditioned it with Kerestase Masintense - wow, what a difference!!  Afer blowdrying my hair it was soft, shiny and had so much bounce!  I woke up this morning and my hair was still awesome.  So glad to have my old hair back - I was beginning to think I had a hormone problem or water problem but it was this Ojon product - horrible if you have the type of hair I have.  Good Luck

This stuff is the worst smelling conditioner I ever encountered.  The perfume penetrated my hair and has not been able to get removed.  It took 2 days before the scent calmed down enough that it was not bothering me with its obnoxiousness.  I wish I could give it a negative rating.  I am glad all I used was a sample and did not pay money to make my hair stink

Might be a great product.  I can't be sure.  Because, uh...hello?...mine didn't come with any instructions whatsover.

I opened it up and I was like, "ah...hello?  Where are the instructions?"  But the Tweezerman Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze did not answer my questions.

If anyone knows how to operate it or would consider selling their instructions, I would greatly appreciate it.  Until then my Tweezerman Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze is just gonna sit there, not being used, like my box of floss, a bag of onions, and my heart.

If philosophy makes it for my skin, I think I own it.  I love the microdelivery peel kit which came with 30 of these pads when I bought the set.  The micro-peel is awesome, but these pads were disappointing.  They dried out in their container and they did not keep up the condition of my skin between peels which is how it was marketed in that kit.  I have seen no difference since I discontinued using this product.  Seems like it could be much less diluted or could be offered in multiple strengths

My experience: I heard such great things about Prevage - restores youthful skin, reverses damage, etc., I couldn't wait until it was available. Finally, I was able to buy it - nice packaging, great dispenser of just the right amount. After two months, I found it to be only a great under makeup moisterizer, and there are plenty of others of equal efficacy for 1/10 the price - Eucerin, for instance.  Kinerase did nothing for me either, so it may just be me - just fyi - fair, sensitive dry skin, middle aged.

I couldn't wait to open my new Ultimate Concealer when it arrived. I thought I was getting the purest and most beneficial makeup on the market. But as I read the ingredient list, my heart fell. 

This is a complete list of the ingredients:
Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Octyldodecanol, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Jojoba Esters, Polyethylene, Stearalkonium Hectorite, Propylene Carbonate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Allantoin, Propylparaben, Dimethicone

May Contain:
Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxides, CI 77499, Mica

This list was taken directly off of the package. Obviously there are many more ingredients than what is listed officially on this page or on Youngblood's website. Make your own decision about whether or not you are comfortable putting some of these ingredients on your face every day

I use the Philosophy 3-in-1 WITH CONDITIONER. It works great and keeps my hair luscious. The one time I accidentally bought a 3-in-1 that didn't have conditioner in it, my hair dried out after two washes and got horrible split ends. After only three applications I had to throw the bottle out. I lost more than an inch off the bottom of my hair. I don't understand how their products can vary so widely in quality, but they do.

This is one of their better scents, however.  I would recommend using this as a body wash only

I ordered this product for my wife 3 weeks before Christmas with several other Philosophy items.  They shipped, this was backordered.  I've sent three messages to them, and have not heard a sinlge response.  Terrible.  Aparently customer services is not a "Philosophy" this company subscribes to.  I have gone ahead and filed a formal complaint through Amazon.  You are probably better off buying their products at a brick and mortar store.  Their online presence is unreliable at best.

These are very well made shears - but they arrived dull, and were unable to cut hair.  After an additional 6$ sharpening they do work fine

I love the Cinnamon Buns shower gel, so I thought I would try the lip gloss. For one thing, it smells/tastes nothing like Cinnamon buns. I don't know what the flavor is, but I don't like it. Maybe they have added almond or something. Secondly, it's way too sticky. My hair kept getting stuck to my lips. It reminds me of vaseline. Since I got this product in a kit, I cannot return it, but I will not be using it again

I bought this item because I heard it was waterproof and I was looking for something to wear swimming. I'm really not impressed. The one thing I will say for it is that the color blended well with my skin. In the bottle it looked like it would be way too dark, so I was surprised by that. It looks like there might be a little wiggle room as far as choosing the correct shade with this one. The coverage is not very good, though. You can put a little extra on without it looking cakey, but it doesn't cover as well as say Lancome's Photogenic foundation. I also highly doubt that it is waterproof. Water-resistant, maybe. Defintely not waterproof. It rubbed off pretty easily with a dry kleenex and even more came off with a wet one. When I tried CoverBlend's water resistant makeup I had to use soap to get it off. The coverage was also much better. Unfortunately they don't offer many shades in the Leg &amp; Body Makeup. I also found that the dew finish did not work for my skin. I have combination skin and tend to have a shiny t-zone. This foundation left me with a shiny nose and forehead. It also made the rest of my face feel slightly oily, which it normally does not. Overall I would say this foundation is a very poor value and I will defintely be returning it to Sephora. At least Sephora has free returns. :

This did nothing for my lashes, which are blonde, but long, so it doesn't take all that much.  It somehow made them look skimpy and clumpy too.  I discovered Diorshow after this and it's phenominal!   But if you want a very good mascara and don't want to spend the money, I recommend Max Factor 2000 calorie.

I bought this mascara based on a review I read on Amazon. Maybe it's just me, but I still find that my lashes "clump" or stick together with this product. It might be the Navy color. I don't think its worth the extra cost - I do just as well with drugstore mascara

I have been on a search for the perfect mascara for many years now, just as many of the reviewers had been.  I purchased this mascara based on the reviews and I am more than disappointed in the mascara.  I would not give you 2 cents for the product and would love to return it.  The mascara is clumpy and will not stick to the eyelash.  I do not mind paying $25.00 for a tube of mascara if it doe's the job, this one doe's not.  I had better luck with Max Factor, Clinque, etc.

For me, it barely looked like I had mascara on at all.  I have blonde eyelashes, so even adding color usually makes my eyes pop, and this didn't really.  I ended up giving it to my mom, thinking that maybe it was just me since so many others loved it, and she didn't like it either.  It ended up in the garbage.  I've loved Dior Show mascara and of course, Great Lash.  I'd recommend those over this, especially for the money

The smell is gorgeous; it really lives up to its name "Happy" -- (being just lightly musk-touched with citrus overtones - it's a great scent for day or night), BUT -- and this is a big BUT, like real happiness, it is very elusive.  As a scent on the skin, it completely fades away after 10 minutes!  For example, today I sprayed it quite liberally and now can't smell it at all, even if I put my nose to my wrist; I swear, it is completely gone.  Very disappointed, and thus cannot recommend it.  5 stars for the scent but minus 4 stars for the staying power = 1 star.

Even the lightest perfumes should have staying power, or else what's the point of wearing them?

The eyeshadow isn't bad, nice color, but the packaging was a disappointment. The brush sits down the center of the encased loose powder and you can't get very much onto the brush. There is no way to open the casing either, so its pretty useless. I found the powder to be an odd texture for a loose eyeshadow also.

I got talked into buying this at the Fresh boutique in Las Vegas.  First, it's very expensive - $38, forgivable if it were outstanding.  It's not even good.  The wand isn't well made, and the product does clump on it, and then it clumps eyelashes rather than lengthen them.  I have tried all week to make this purchase work out for the best, but to no avail.  The worst part is, at the end of the day if I happen to rub my eyes, it smears - racoon eyes.  I've been using Physicians formula and Revlon with the primer both are exponentially better, and I could have purchased eight of them for the cost of Supernova.  On the positive side, it washes off easily and completely with soap and water.

My sister-in-law bought this product for me after I had admired the shade (Purr, a light baby pink color) that she was wearing. I have used other MAC products before with great results, but was VERY dissapointed with this product. 

First of all, I gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. However, this product is sticky. VERY sticky! It does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. Not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. When I wear a lip gloss, I want to be soft and smooth feeling. I want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak. 

Also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. This will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. Very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!  

This product seems to be popular with other viewers, however, I would never reccomend this to anyone

I usually love the Philosophy brand bath and shower gels, but this was a major disappointment-didn't smell anything like pound cake or lavender for that matter-in fact the odor is quite strong and nauseating. There are other gels that are great but AVOID this one! Phew!!

The company/shipping was fine.  No beefs there.  The product itself I find to be rather damaging to the skin.  In order to extract, you have to press down EXTREMLY hard, (If you can even locate what your attempting to extract w/that darn pin hole at the end.)  I can't imagine this wouldn't leave scars.  I wouldn't reccomend this product. I just put it in the drawer, never to be used again.  :

So, I've owned a tweezerman extractor before, and I am now questioning why I didnt go with my instinct and just stick with the familiar...This extractor is no help what so ever. the loop hole is entirely too small and it would be by complete and utter chance that I would press the right pore. its just too small to even target. the lance is helpful for blackheads but it is really sharp and if youre not careful, you could damage your skin. i would recommend not buying this extractor. i would much rather have preferred to sticking with the tweezerman..

The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of one is because I love Benefit. That being said, this perfume is what we like to call a sleeper. It's so faint that you can hardly smell it, but when you do, it's not pleasing at all and you immediately scramble for something that smells better. If you are looking for a young, fun perfume, stay away from this one. It smells old and drab, like your grandmother's china cabinet or an antique store. But if you like that..

I found StriVectin-SD Eye Cream to be a nicely textured cream, but it was too heavy for my skin. This is rather strange, as I have dryish skin around my eyes and like a heavier eye cream. This one clogged up my orbital area so much that I got millia (which I never suffered from before). 

The cream does not absorb very well, but feels good to touch. 

In terms of wrinkles, I had 0 effect. I in my late 20's and am strating to notice the first crow's feet. StriVectin-SD did nothing to alleviate them. 

I have to express an opinion on the price though. If you do like the product and it works for you, price should not be an issue, as the tube lasts forever. I have used it for 6 months easily and am now getting concerned that eye products should be thrown away after such long time. Yet it hasn't run out yet. 

I give it 2 out ot 5 - for the nice texture. And an impressive  advertising campaign that convinced me to try it!

I wouldn't call these a regrettable purchase...I guess I was just a little mislead about how these thing worked.  It doesn't explain that on the packaging. 

I couldn't figure out why the box was so heavy.  They are just socks, right?  Right??  Well, they aren't.  The insides are coated with some sort of heavy-duty silicone.  This makes your feet sweat when you put them on.  I mean, they really sweat.  When you wake up, you're feet have sweat so much that any outer layer of skin cells you have sloughed off.  Hence the soft feet.  And very warm feet.  They'll be good for winter.

The reason why you're only supposed to wear these once a week is because I bet you'll get a really alarming fungus if you do it more.  I tried them two nights in a row once and day 3 greeted me with an intense athletes-foot-like itch.  Not fun.  

The other gripe I have is that they don't come with washing instructions.  Great.  These socks have one purpose in life, and that is to make your feet sweat and then refuse to be washed.  I found that handwashing them in the sink with some handsoap works fine.  For now, anyway.  I don't think they belong in the washing machine.  A laundry horror story is likely to ensue.

Never had I been so unhappy with my makeup as I was when I was using Clinique. I used Stay Beige (which I lightly patted on my face on top of Clinique's superfit liquid makeup - I have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. I also hated how Clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades, so that I had to settle for Honey in the liquid and Beige in the powder. As much as I went back to Macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades, they just wouldn't listen. Either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade, or they were convinced I was making a big deal out of nothing. Instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which I shouldn't have to do in the first place) I just switched to a different makeup line: Laura Mercier, which I am VERY happy with.

I've had many other friends who were unhappy with Clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand, as well. I'm not trying to knock the product. I'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people I know. I would definitely NOT recommend Clinique to anyone. I'd rather pay a little more and get better results rather than settle for a $20 product just because it's affordable.

I bought this with a kit. This stuff was just not worth it to me. But unlike the others I cannot stand the smell. It is very strong and gave me a headache so I could not really leave it on that long. My scalp did feel conditioned though. But if you are sensitive to strong smells be aware that this stuff may bother you.

What's the point of this mascara when half the container doesn't do what it's supposed to do? The black mascara is not good quality--it comes off very quickly. Part of the problem may be that the brush is simply too tiny--larger brushes are far superior when it comes to applying mascara. And the silver stuff--the only reason someone would seek out this product--is all but invisible on the lashes regardless of how many times you go over your lashes with the wand.

My sister-in-law bought this product for me after I had admired the shade (Purr, a light baby pink color) that she was wearing. I have used other MAC products before with great results, but was VERY dissapointed with this product. 

First of all, I gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. However, this product is sticky. VERY sticky! It does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. Not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. When I wear a lip gloss, I want to be soft and smooth feeling. I want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak. 

Also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. This will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. Very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!  

This product seems to be popular with other viewers, however, I would never reccomend this to anyone

Not what I expected! This shampoo soap ruined the texture of my hair. It has no conditioning whatsoever. I used the Jungle conditioner after the shampoo. It is equally hopeless! It is like the clothes washing soap you get in the villages of India! A waste of money, a lot of false advertising and a lot of hype.

Clinique's Exfoliating Scrub is a facial scrub for oily skin. It is a thick, white paste packed with medium-size scrubbing grains -more grains than in Clinique's "7 Day Scrub" for normal skin. To use, massage onto clean, wet skin in a circular motion. Rinse with warm water. Careful not to get it in your eyes, as I did once while rinsing it off in the shower. This scrub does an adequate job of exfoliating and retexturizing skin. But it's unsuitable for sensitive skin, and it stinks to high heaven. It contains menthol, which burns skin and clears the sinuses at no extra charge. Having so much menthol so close to my nose is not a good thing. Of course, it is "100% Fragrance Free" according to Clinique, meaning that the smell of menthol is unadulterated by perfumes. The scrub also contains salicylic acid, so beware that this might be too drying for some skin types, especially if used frequently. The performance isn't bad. The olfactory aesthetics are atrocious. This is the harshest, most caustic facial scrub I've ever used. Sensitive complexions beware

I love Clinique products and have used them for more than 20 years. The Exfoliating Scrub is convenient because it comes in a tube and rinses off easily. (though you only get 3.4 oz., and must use quite a bit of it to see good results). However, it does not work as well as the original "Seven Day Scrub". The original product while greasy and a bit of a pain to use, exfoliates almost as well as professional microdermabrasion and does not irritate - even with daily use. A few years ago I spent the summer neglecting to use my sun block. Needless to say, my skin became a mess (dull, blotchy, discolorations, rough, flaky, etc.). I began my basic Clinique regimen (Mild Facial Soap, Clarifying lotion #2, Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion, and the Seven Day Srub). In less than two weeks I saw a huge difference, my skin was back to normal. I had tried the Exfoliating Scrub later, since I hated to deal with the original "seven day" but soon went back to it as it truly works best. Now I always wear an SPF 45 on my face and stick with my Seven Day Scrub.

It is true that this product smells absolutely awful after it is applied to the face. Worse, it does absolutely nothing. I have been applying a significant amount morning and night, for 6 weeks, allowing it to soak in and dry... It does nothing

I've had excellent luck with Tweezerman products in the past, but the quality of this blackhead remover was second-rate.  The item consists of a hollow metal tube with two screw-in attachments.

Neither attachments really work.  The threading of both seems to be flawed.  And to use it as intended would mean to press an unstable attachment against your face; no thanks!

My e-mailed request for re-threading or replacement to Tweezerman went unanswered.  This purchase was an expensive mistake

Wanting to try  something new, I picked up this little spritz. I was looking for an engergizing 'pick-me-up' that I could use in the middle of the day. I won't purchase this item again. After regular use, I did not find any difference in my skin (normal-oily, make-up free), did not experience any engergizing feeling, and quickly discovered that this product tastes terrible. The directions state to 'close your eyes and spray 10cm from you face' but this method lands the product on your lips - that would be how I discovered the awful taste.

The one redeeming value I have for this product is the scent; I'm a huge fan of citrus based scents. But that benefit does not justify the cost of this product.

I received the vanilla grapefruit sticks as a gift from one of My boys.  The sticks are very thin and only burn about halfway down the entire length.  Re-lighting is useless bc there is no fragrance left at the bottom half of the stick to burn.  The scent doesn't remind Me of vanilla grapefruit- more like plain burning sticks, which won't cost you $13.  Votivo does candles well, but the aromatic sticks leave something to be desired.  Not worth the money.

I ordered this product because it was recommended to me on another skincare website.  However, I haven't wanted to use this product much due to it's odor.  Very medicinal/chemical smelling.  Makes me wonder what sort of harsh chemicals are going on my face!  I used it pretty consistently the first two weeks and didn't notice any difference in my skin.  I wouldn't recommend this product, unless a dermatologist specifically tells you to use it.

This item was fine when it came to pictures; tattoos were not visible on film for the first part of our wedding. However I was told by a few of the guests that it looked like I had been in a fight before the wedding... make-up should not look like bruises!
The make-up also started to fade not long after the ceremony ended, and it was a short ceremony.  By the end of the reception (four hours later) you could clearly see the tattoos.
Also, I was told that the make-up would not rub off onto clothing if I used the special setting powder together with the cream... Not true.  I now have make-up stains on one of my brides maids dresses.
I realize now that I should have just let the tattoos show.  Why have a tattoo if you're not willing to show it off

Dermablend Leg and Body Cover reminds me alot of mud.  You know how you get mud on your shoes and it is dark at first but then dries to look alot lighter and flakes off?  That's a very accurate comparison to this product.  It sets to a very chalky, dry, finish which appears flaky and has a pasty, corpse like gray tinge to it.  It is creepy looking!  Even with all of the colors that are available it still looks unnatural and ashy when dry. 
The only way I was able to use it was to cover my tattoo with the product and then disguise the hideously fake makeup under a pair of thick, shimmery dance tights!! You couldn't pull it off with just the makeup on your bare skin though.
It would be great if you want to dress up like a mummy or decaying corpse for Halloween though

Okay so in the beginning, I was so excited about this perfume.  It smelled AMAZING and the scent lasted FOREVER.  When I say forever, literally forever.  You spray it on after your shower in the afternoon and then go to sleep?  It lasts until the next afternoon.  It's not even just a weak scent that's left on you.  It's like as if you've been spraying it constantly. 

But here's the bad part.  After using it for awhile, I felt sick in the stomach becuase the scent was so strong.  I felt like the scent was a little too deep.  It's great for people who like strong distinct scents.  If not though, this isn't the product for you

This was my first cologne purchase.  It's a really delicious scent -- complex and pleasant, not overpowering.  Give it 15 min to dry and mix with your skin.  It truly does smell different from the first spray.  I can't stop smelling myself...I really love the smell.

My only complaint (and it's a biggy) is that it doesn't last for more than a few hours.  After two or three hours it's completely gone except for a slight trace when I press my nose to my skin.  I've tried spraying it on my body (neck, wrists) and also my clothing, and it just doesn't last.  I feel the need to carry the bottle with me and reapply it every few hours, but that's not going to realistically happen.  It's really disappointing, since it's so delicious

There is absolutely nothing special about this leave-in conditioner, besides the fact that it smells really good.  However, I didn't see any changes in my daughter's hair after using this conditioner.  NONE.  It is watered down so you must rub it in your hair very quickly. Otherwise, it will run down your face and neck (wish it came with a spray pump instead).  I was expecting some sort of difference since this product line is well-known and has a lot of star/ celebrity power behind it.  However, I found this conditioner to be all hype

I bought the entire line of products from the Lisa's Hair Regimen on the Carol's daughter website. I took all the products back to Sephora yesterday. I used this Hair oil on my scalp and the next day my scalp started itching. I washed it that night and woke up the next morning in serious pain. I wear my hair natural and I had what felt like chemical burns all over my scalp. When I took the product back to Sephora the lady who sold it to me told me my scalp was RED w/ white spots all throughout it. I had to take OTC pain medication twice a day for three days just to help me sleep at night due to the pain. The only thing I can attribute it to is an allergic reaction. The product contain extracts from different types of plant and flowers. If you have allergies to these items I would suggest not using this product. I contacted Carol's Daughter and have not heard back from them yet. I would have expected more from the company who's product states 'Made with Love, Peace'.

OK, so this is the 2nd Philosophy product that I've tried and felt the need to write a review on. I have to say, this product is far below expectations. I sprayed in on, and the only thing you smell is the alcohol. There seems to be no other notes to it, even after you let it settle, all you can pick up is alcohol. Definitely not recommending this product.

I was very unhappy with this product. First the shipping took way too long. Second, the tube is much smaller than sold at Macy's and the cost is more. And the contents were gross, very goopy. Not smooth. Like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months. I'll fight the mall to buy this next time

My sister-in-law bought this product for me after I had admired the shade (Purr, a light baby pink color) that she was wearing. I have used other MAC products before with great results, but was VERY dissapointed with this product. 

First of all, I gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. However, this product is sticky. VERY sticky! It does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. Not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. When I wear a lip gloss, I want to be soft and smooth feeling. I want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak. 

Also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. This will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. Very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!  

This product seems to be popular with other viewers, however, I would never reccomend this to anyone

This stuff is supposed to help razor burn, ingrown hairs. Honestly after all the time using it I can't honestly say if it works. What I can say is that it smells terrible. Not a weak terrible smell, but a strong, overpowering stink.
It also burns like crazy when you put it on.

The Tend Skin company puts out this story about a miraculous discovery - a dentists patient came to him after a tooth extraction and raved that whatever the anesthetic was that he was given, it had cured his ingrown hairs.

Well, there are three ingredients in tend skin - alcohol, glycerin, and aspirin. Thats it.
So apparently this dental patient had been cured of ingrown hairs by taking an aspirin.

Bottom line is, this product is insanely overpriced, and they hide it with this distortion, this silly propaganda about its "miraculous discovery."

A little bottle of alcohol and aspirin should cost a tenth of this

I have always had problems with razor burn and shaving issues overall.  It used to be a disaster and I was introduced and used Tend Skin for the past two or three years now.  I got a sample of Solution 2 out in the Hamptons last weekend and I could not possibly be happier.  It is a significant improvement over Tend Skin--the roller ball applicator is brilliant and I have officially (thankfully) pitched my cotton ball bag.  It does not sting nearly as much as Tend Skin.  It smells so much better (actually pretty good!) and it works better too.  I used to get very dry patches on my neck from using Tend Skin but I have had no dryness issues with Solution 2.  I used to have a strict regimen using Tend Skin in order to get through my shaving procedure.  Now, I roll on the Solution 2 and it's all good:)

I really do not feel tend skin works as advertised. The irritation to my neck persisted and if anything had only gotten worse after applying as instructed. One good thing is that you if you are like me and have trouble waking up in the morning --- tend skin helps for that! Just take a strong whiff and you'll be alert and ready for your day!

I used to use Tend Skin. It works ok, but there are better things out there now. Tend Skin is an outdated product...like the sytptic pencil. Tend Skin stings, smells like pure alcohol and there is lots of wasted product because it is easy to spill. I recently switched to MiN Solution2 like it much better than Tend Skin. MiN Solution2 has a roller application (no waste), organic spearmint (fresh smell) and doesn't burn like Tend Skin.

i received my order of three oils...jasmine,ambergris, and musk...their fragrance was so obscured by the oil medium that you cut the essential oil with that they all smelled very close to the same...i have caswellmassey oils from 30 years ago and they are still true to their fragrance and it is true...one drop will last all day and often linger for more...have they sold out or sold their name
 
i only ordered three oils because somewhere i read if you order 25 dollars or more from you the shipping was free...this was not the case...i was charged for shipping
 
these products i received are a joke...the caswellmassey name is no longer associated with an exemplary product...i am sure the original caswellmassey folks are turning over in their graves every time you send this "jokeoil" to an unsuspecting customer...shame on you...shame on you all

This mascara works great; it lengthens, separates, and defines your lashes and it doesn't smudge, but it's so hard to take off!  I used Lancome's Bi-Facil makeup remover, which is designed to remove waterproof mascara, but it was still hard to remove.  I lost quite a few lashes in the process.  I would recommend buying the regular Definicils, not the waterproof

After reading the great reviews of the votivo candles I decided to spend the rediculous sum of $24 on a moroccan spice candle.When I received the candle I smelled sweet spice coming from it even before I opened the packaging.Readying myself for a rocket of rich fragrance immersing my room in exotic spice I hopefully lit the candle.After about an hour of the candle being lit I came into my room and it scented only about 3 feet around the candle.Dissapointed, and perhaps to prove that there was absolutely no way I didn't get jacked on this purchase I lit it again-this time for 3 hours.There was still no smell.Compare this with the $6 'tea' candles I bought from the Gold Canyon Candle Co. which when I lit 6 of them richly scented not only my room (which is about 13' 13') but the hallway, as well as my mothers room next door (16' 16')!If your thinking that maybe the $22+ dollars would be worth it for the exotic fragrances-think again as there was nothing special about the scent that you couldn't get from the grocery store. Jipped-you bet

I have tried the LUSH products and found them kinda good but then my friend introduced me to the MELT product line. Any benefits I thought I was getting from LUSH... out the window. Their products seemed, all the sudden, unimpressive. And I really like that MELT is Denver based! Try them out and see what you think for yourself (If you aren't here in Colorado I know they have online products too) and make your own choice. I recomend them though and I have told everyone I know to switch! :-

Like the Fresh Farmacy, I bought this soap based on the reviews and ended up giving it to a friend at work.  Don't get me wrong, I love most of Lush's products and, to my husbands chagrin, end up spending a lot of money on their online products but when I got this particular soap I just couldn't get into it.  I admit that it smelled a bit better after showering with it for the first time but still found myself reaching for my "Sexy Peel" over this stuff.  I ended up giving it to a friend that I work with but only after it had been passed over my three other girls in my office...I'm just not getting the "heavenly scent" that this item was described as having in previous reviews

This product didn't work for me, as described. 

First of all, it does smell nice, which is different from the usual fumes nail polishes give off! Smells lemony! 

Its also easy to use - you brush it on over nails and surrounding area, let it set for awhile until it gets dull and then gently buff it off with a tissue. 

That was all fine and dandy, but it didn't leave my nails all that dry, nor did it leave them shiny. In fact, they were less shiny than the shiny topcoats I use. 

I also had the worse case of bedsheet wrinkles embedded in my manicure that night after using this product - could be unrelated, but I've never seen so many creases and smudges in my nails when I woke up and I let them dry for a few hours after painting them! 

I wouldn't recommend this product.

I bought this for my wife for the holidays, it was a bit expensive for a candle but I believed that it would last a long time and burn uniformly. However, in our case, after about an hour the candle went out. The wick burned too quickly, becoming too small, and now the candle won't stay lit for more than a few minutes before it drowns in the wax. The return shipping will cost a lot, so we will just toss it out. Waste of money, don't buy one

I got Very Irresistible by Givenchy Perfume as a gift for Christmas.  As first smell, I loved it.  Then I spritzed it and yikes! That was 2 months ago and I still have the scent on me.

It's too flowery -- it's not a clean, fresh scent.  More of a "I sprayed a little too much potpouri in here" scent.  Not for people with mild allergies to perfumes either!!

If you're really looking forward to brightening your blonde, go to the salon and ask for a non-ammonia hair lightening or use an OTC temporary product.  Chamomile would have to be used every day for months to really make a change in your color.  The expense of this product is not justified by the results, and while LUSH likes to toot its horn about being "natural", that designation could apply to arsenic.  It's pretty meaningless when combined with artificial preservatives on the top ten list for dangerous additives - the parabens

I'm Black and for my hair type, 4b, I try to use natural products on my hair and it didn't have those "no-no chemicals and oils" that are known to be damaging to black hair.  

Well this product did not, as it advertised, which was to "stay put."  I tried to use it with my hair clean and dry and then with my hair clean and damp and it did nothing both times to hold my comb-coils or finger-coil in place.  

I did give the product 2 stars because it does smell pretty good.  Sad thing is that I can't get my money back. I use it as a hair grease for my scalp. I hope I've been helpful

I ordered the Saturday Morning Special gift set and tried the Tui Herbal Shampoo right away.  As with everyone else, no lather and lots of tangles.  After the second wash, I decided to use my Pantene Relaxed and Natural to try and get some lather and moisture in my hair.  This stuff is a rip off.  On the plus side, it works fabulously on my children's hair. They are bi-racial and have naturally curly hair.  I don't recommend this to anyone with relaxed hair.  It just doesn't work

Maybe my expectations were too high due to the hype surrounding these products.  However, this shampoo did not work for me.  Like the previous reviewer said, it was watery and did not lather at all.  It also made my hair feel stripped and left it very hard.  I followed up with a hair smoothie, but a large amount of my hair broke off due to how dry and unmanageable the product left my hair.  I do not recommend this at all

This shampoo is so bad that I thought perhaps the wrong product had been put into a shampoo bottle by mistake. It is watery and does not lather. My hair felt like it hadn't been washed for days, and the next day I had to use a different shampoo to get rid of the film. I never write reviews but felt this might save someone from wasting $10.00

All I can say is DO NOT buy this [...].  I just got this stuff and used it for the first and LAST time.  It smells horrible.  It left a wax like film over my hair that was so bad I could not even get a comb through it.  I had to wash my hair (with a different product of course) at least 6 times to get it back to normal again...........WHAT A COMPLETE RIP OFF!!!

I received two sizeable chunks of Karma soap in a couple of my orders and I thought I'd give it a go.  EEEEP - there's a whole bunch of patchouli in there (which I hate, but still thought I should at least try).  Maybe I'm overly sensitive to the patchouli but it was so strong.  The soap as a whole smelled like a sickening mix of syrup-y orange soda mixed with that dreaded patchouli.  To be fair though, you CAN smell different elements in it and appreciate it for that.  Aside from this, this soap melts incredibly fast.  Even if you keep it in a draining soap dish, even if you take it completely out of the shower, away from the steam,  it still melts at an alarming rate!

I can see how people (who love herbal scents) would like this.  It IS a unique scent that has depth and layers to it,  but it's just not for me

I have glorious white hair, and I thought this would be good for it.  But it seems to dry my hair too much, and frankly I don't see that it's any better than the two dollar bottle of Suave that's out there. I've also used Lush's BIG shampoo and Soak 'n' Float shampoo bars, and I like them much better.

I have to agree with another reviewer. This product is not worth the price tag. It claims to have a vanilla scent, and it does, but it is barely noticible. Don't buy this product based on how it smells. As a moisturizer, you can do much better for $23.00.

The shipping was very slow and the product really isn't worth $23 with shipping for an 11 oz jar.  The product goes on like Lubriderm where it feels like you are just smearing water on your skin.  Then it starts to feel a little oily but once you get dressed your skin just feel like you have powder all over skin.  Overall it was just ok but it ended up not being what I expected or wanted.  I was looking for a really good long lasting moisturizer.

Like said in an earlier review, after a couple weeks the mirror quits working and fogs up so bad you can't see a thing in it in the shower.  I run hot water on it and it still fogs up after a couple minutes, then you can't clear it with any method.  Total waste, not worth a dollar.

I love Laura Mercier's skin products, but her makeup line has these dark, cherry-burnt-orange-rasberry colors that just don't work for fair skin or  blonde hair (which I have.) I wish her colors were better, there was only 1 eye color I could wear in this kit, and the 3 glow stick things were confusing, because they weren't sticks.

I read about Bobbi Brown tinited moisturizer as a recommendation in a magazine and decided to try it.  I went to Saks and the saleswoman "made up my face" using the moisturizer.  I thought I liked the look in the store and felt the coverage stayed on all day during my shopping.  However, the next day when I applied the moisturizer alone without all the other products I discovered I didn't like it.  It went on and immediately the product seemed to sink into the pores of my skin and also seemed cakey.  I am going to return this product and the concealer that I bought as well.  This product just doesn't apply very smoothly.  I think I will try the Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer that everyone is raving about instead

As rosey as this oils smells, it just isn't as good as the real thing.  Being a fragrance oil, it has no medicinal properties.  I certainly wouldn't use it on my skin, or in a bath!  Thanks, but no thanks.  You definitely get what you pay for

When I first spray Inis Energy of the Sea Cologne Spray, I could not smell any thing! Then I spray more and more 'till I found out how it smells! It has nice scent, Okay, I'll tell you how I found it; it is not bad! 
BUT despite that, it doesn't last for more than half an hour, and then it hardly can be smelled. You may need to have it with you all the time and spray every half hour. This is what disappointed me the most!
I am telling you my taste here, that isn't necessarily yours.

 I was very excited to receive this product,yet my enthusiasm quickly turned to confusion.Call me foolish,but I thought perfume was to have a sweet,pleasant aroma{?. This pot had the distinct scent of a citronella {skeeter} candle...like the one I could smell burning from my neighbors yard last Summer!!!! I kept applying and re-applying it to "get a smell" from it...Not much luck. Maybe the spray perfume smells far better??? I do not understand how the founder says this perfume gets so many compliments!How? If I rubbed the bug candle wax on my wrists, I WOULD NOT have gals clammoring around me asking me what I was wearing!!!!I wore this a few times just to see the reactions.....Only 1 person said they could "sota" smell something! I tried Paris Hilton, and Britney's fantasy, and got TONS of compliments! Buy at your own discretion

Falling in Love is one of my favorite scents ever.  It's basically my go-to fragrance for everyday.  If you're a fan of this scent you already know it's really pretty but very light.  That's why I was exited about the solid for touch-ups on the go.  Let me tell you, subtle is an understatement for this product. When I opened the seal and held it under my nose I could hardly smell it.  When I applied it (generously) to my wrist the scent was barely detectable.  I rubbed my wrists together to gently warm the perfume and it didn't help at all.  I expected this to be fairly concentrated so that little dabs would suffice.  Very disappointing.

I received this soap free with an online purchase. I have never purchased soap from Lush and I don't think I will after my experience with Ooh La La. The scent is pleasant enough, and the color of the bar is this stunning deep purple (kind of like a grape!), but it doesn't feel like soap when I'm using it. It kind of smears a purplish film on me and then when I rinse it off, my skin feels very tight and dry. I've been unable to get any lather from this bar, although admittedly I do have very hard water where I live. I read that previous reviewers complained about how long this soap lasts. Like with all Lush products, it's imperative that you not leave it in the shower or tub and let it dry completely between uses. I've used the bar four or five times and while it's noticeably smaller than when I opened it, I probably have about 90 percent of it left.

I was looking forward to a lovely lavender scent when I got this soap,  but sadly, that's not what happened.  The smell is a very strong herbal;  like the kind you would add to an Italian pasta dish.   Not very appealing!  There is some complexity to the scent, but it's so overshadowed by the herb smell to really come through.  On the plus side,  the color is beautiful (a rich, dark purple) and the lather is equally lovely to look at.  If you like true herbal scents, then you should give this a try.  

It just wasn't for me.

Love that when amazon deletes all the reviews for a product! Well, this one used to have about 3 five-star ratings. I added my two cents- this product did nothing for me whatsoever. So, some people love it. I don't get it. And, it's pretty much the opposite of an anti-oxidant, so that doesn't make sense. I pointed this out in my review. Wonder if vendors have the choice to delete all reviews if they get one bad enough?

Also, it's listed at $45 on amazon as well. from the same supplier. huh

I can truly say that this products doesn't work. I have silky wavy fine hair and I am a hair food junkie so I used a lot of things, but this don't work. Usually anything can tame my hair but all this conditioner do is make it hard, matted, and tangled. Carol Daughter's products may work for some, but it hasn't work for anyone in my family and we all have different hair textures

I ordered the gift set and it came as advertised. Very cute package. Unfortunately no one sells this product on the east coast (that I could find) so I could not test it. It is far too strong a scent, even the lotion. The candle filled the house with the scent in 10 minutes. My advice, find someone or someplace that offers this product before purchasing

I really wanted this to work.  I have serious dark circles under my eyes and have tried everything else.  But I've been using this twice a day for two months and I haven't noticed any improvement at all.  Not even a little.  In fact, my eyes might actually look worse.  It has not faded the dark circles, nor has it improved the bags.

I fell for the hype and now am out quite a bit of money....... Save your money, trust me! I used this product 2-3 times a day until the entire tube was gone (took several months) and saw NO change whatsoever! I have serious dark circles, which is what it claims to help. I am VERY disappointed with this company and their product and will never buy any item with their name on it again! What a bunch of crap......   BTW - look at *all* the reviews, this product is listed in several places here !!

After I ordered this product, one of my co-workers told me about the reviews on Amazon.  I checked it out and I was really surprised!  The reviews are poor.  The worst part, though, is that the product is listed three times!!  What's the deal??  A product gets a bad review, so they re-list it... more bad reviews and they re-list it AGAIN!  See for yourself, do a general search for "Hylexin" and you will see several listings of the SAME product.  Trying to out run bad reviews????  I now think less of the product AND Amazon.  Shame on you both

The click-stick applicator is ridiculous. You have no control over the shadow. When you click it, nothing comes out. You have to twist about ten times, and then, suddenly, a huge blob, enough for eighteen applications, comes busting out. The only way I've found to apply this is to use my own shadow brush dipped in this huge blob. I purchased three colors at the same time and all three tubes work in this same way. As far as the actual shadow, it's fine. Nothing spectacular. You could get the same product from Wet'N Wild for a buck.

I have an ancient Lancome facial brush that I was attempting to replace.  I bought this brush, tried it, and went back to my old one.  In my opinion, this brush is far too soft and doesn't feel like it is cleaning at all.  A wash cloth would be better

I have horrible bags and deep creases along edge of preorbital area. Of all the products I have tried, Olay Regenerist eye cream works the best. Also my plastic surgeon said that part of the dark purple is my muscle showing thru because I have excess skin but no fat in periorbital area. He said he will inject fat from my rear(plenty) and that will lessen the color, and after he removes excess skin, he will use laser

I paid $100.00 for a tube of Hylexin because I have serious dark circles.  Unfortunately, I fell for the hype because I would have tried anything that says, "Significantly reduces dark circles!"  I followed the directions and waited....NOTHING!  I teach Business Ehtics at a University.  Part of the course involves ethics in advertising.  I use the Hylexin example of how people are duped by the wording, the packaging, etc.
Please take my word for it and save yourself some money

I have eczema, so my scalp is very dry and sensitive. This relaxer burned my hair so severely I though it would fall out. I developed huge scores with thick scabs after having this relaxer professionally applied to my hair.

I used Phytospecific Relaxer on my virgin hair during the summer (2006). I first thought it to be a great investment ($60) and worth the cost. After use, I found my hair to be relaxed but not "bone straight" as I've experienced with other relaxers which is what I desired. My hair is very soft and fine and quite sensitive to chemicals so I was in search of a product that would straighten my hair and not leave any damaging affects.

After the 2nd treatment (September 2006), I soon found that my hair was experiencing breakage around the temples and severe breakage at the nape of my neck. I quit using the product.

Perhaps this product works for some but as mentioned earlier, my hair is quite sensitive to chemicals and unfortunately, I experienced hair loss! So, it's back to the drawing (or growing) board for me

I am black American and have combination hair...nappy, wavy and straight.  I've been using drug store relaxers for over 30 years (CrÃ¨me of Nature, TCB, Dark &amp; Lovely, Revlon Realistic) whatever is "on sale" with satisfying results.   These products leave my hair evenly straight and shiny but hard and stiff immediately after the process.  I usually wash my hair after a few days (I like to give it a rest after relaxing) and use a good conditioner to soften and detangle.  From there I am able to go about 12 weeks before having to retouch.  In general my hair is healthy and responds well to straightners.  My biggest expense is with conditioning products to maintain my hair.  I'll try anything and spend any amount if it works well on my hair.  I have great success with Frederic Fekkai products and love Phytodefrisant Botanical Hair Relaxing Balm...this stuff is amazing if you like to wash and go (air dry) and it works wonders with blow drying/flat ironing too.  (Bumble and Bumble Styling Spray is another amazing product for great flat ironing results.)

I forked out $60 to try Phtyo2 after reading all the rave reviews.  I am satisfied with the outcome but not blown away.  Yes, Phyto2 did not smell bad, it did not burn my scalp and it did straighten my hair but no better than Dark and Lovely or TCB, and my hair was still hard and stiff afterward.

It has been several weeks and my hair is doing great, but again no different from when I use Dark &amp; Lovely.  I guess I am lucky that my hair responds well to ANY type of relaxer so I doubt I'll be spending another $60 for Phyto2...I'd rather buy two tubes of Phytodefrisant Balm and continue to with my $7.99 drug store brands.  I hope this helps someone with similar hair as mine.  If you do well with drug store brands, Phyto results are not that different...spend the money on their other products that nourish and condition your hair

The instructions say, "Use whenever your skin needs a boost."  It goes on to imply that you will see a result every time you use it - it's not one of these products where you need to use it repeatedly to see results.  I bought it at a big upscale department store and used it that night.  Now that winter is approaching, my skin gets a little wacky at times.

The product comes out as a gel but becomes creamy as you apply it on the damp skin.  The instructions are to leave it on until a "full froth" forms (approximately 5 minutes), then rinse off.

The cream began to take on the consistency of foam after about 2 minutes, and at the end of 5 minutes the foam was beginning to dissipate and leave big empty patches on my skin, so I rinsed it off.  

My skin didn't look any different when done.  It didn't feel any different when done.  For $52 I expected at least some type of visible change - even if it made my skin redder, or plumper, or something.

Unfortunately the box is now in the bottom of the trash, so I can't return it.  We have Christmas guests coming; maybe one of them will enjoy using it

I bought the entire line of products from the Lisa's Hair Regimen on the Carol's daughter website. I took all the products back to Sephora yesterday. I used this Hair oil on my scalp and the next day my scalp started itching. I washed it that night and woke up the next morning in serious pain. I wear my hair natural and I had what felt like chemical burns all over my scalp. When I took the product back to Sephora the lady who sold it to me told me my scalp was RED w/ white spots all throughout it. I had to take OTC pain medication twice a day for three days just to help me sleep at night due to the pain. The only thing I can attribute it to is an allergic reaction. The product contain extracts from different types of plant and flowers. If you have allergies to these items I would suggest not using this product. I contacted Carol's Daughter and have not heard back from them yet. I would have expected more from the company who's product states 'Made with Love, Peace'.

Until a couple of years ago this used to be the gold standard of leave-ins:  It made my dry, curly hair soft, shiny, and smelling great!  But lately something has changed. The once thick, silky liquid has turned thin and watery, with a distinctly alcohol-like smell.  It's so disappointing... this product has gone from 5 to 2 stars in my book.  Don't bother with it anymore, unless the original formula comes back

In all honesty, I'd rate the fragrance itself as "5 stars," however, the scent does not last for love nor money, which is why I give it a mere "1 star."  You'll find that you have to continuously apply it in order for anyone to compliment you on it and, consequently, before you know it, you've depleted your perfume!  Talk to anyone who has worn or even sells this fragrance and, if they're honest, they will tell you exactly what I've written here.  Because I adore the scent, I'm going to try the Baby Phat Goddess Body Lotion and see if that has a lingering effect

i think this product would be great, but wasn't able to use it becasue the description of it on this website and on phiolosphy's website does't give you one tiny bit of information.  the very last step, the very last sentence says that you shouldn't use this product if you are prone to breakouts because this will cause a severe breakout.  the reason i bought this was to clear up my face, so it would have been nice to know this before i am about to apply it to my skin

This didn't do anything for me. Is it supposed to have very subtle cumulative effect? I am returning it. I'm really surprised others had such great results, because I tried it twice and left it on for double the time, and still it did nothing more than wash my face and maybe moisturize with the cream. It does have more than baking soda and H2O2- also contains catalase, some stearic acid, and some vitamin C. Of course, your skin already has its own catalase.

i've read so many positive reviews about this and i wanted to buy it so very much. but when i got around to actually smell it...i was so dissapointed, i can only smell an old lady perfume, a bug spray, i don't know, something so strong and not strong in the right way. my favourites are Dior J'adore, Red Delicious, Intuition( Estee Lauder), try them instead if you want to feel sexy and powerful

Ok Ive been Using Proactiv 4 about a year now and i have to say that it did work for me well like 90% with one or two breakouts a month so i was pretty pleased about that. People often asked me what i did cuz my change was drastic, so that was nice.

One night i styed up late and that Murad infomercial came on and it looked pretty convincing since there where no celebritys advertising it and they even compared it to proactiv, so i tough i would give it a try so i ordered it online the next day.

Couple Of Days later i received the package and i was pretty exited so i began to use it and liked the overall feel of it. few days pass by and i wake up one morning with all these little white heads in my upper chin and i was immidiately grossed out but since they said it was normal due to purging i didnt worry much, one week later it got worse and even began breaking out in places i hadnt before like in my forehead. I knew somethign wasnt right so i went online and started reading other custumer reviews and was shocked at the similaruty of thwe problem so i freaked out and decided to stop using it because it got so bad to the point where i didnt wanna be seen and on top of that it became very painful both physically and mentally i becamed sorth of depressed about the situation i sorth of felt like a teen going trough puberty again. 

I Have now gone back to proactiv and seen improvement so hopefully within the next couple of weeks it will clear up again untill then i wanna crawl under a rock hahaha. My main advice is to really do ur research before trying something new because u may end up worse than before

I purchased the Murad Acne Complex for $40 or so (for a measley one month supply).  I was disgustingly excited to try it, as everything else has failed me.  Proactiv works wonderfully for me, but only for the first month or two, then it seems I grow an immunity to it.

I paid to have the Murad Acne Complex expedited to me because I was so anxious to get on to 'beautiful, clear skin.'  I read the pamphlet, and understood that my skin could go through a "purging" phase, where your skin literally purges all of the bacteria and other acne causing assailants.  Imagine the worst skin you've ever seen.  Imagine the most painful breakouts.  That was my personal "purging" process.  It was literally the worst breakout of my entire life.  My husband kept telling me to continue using the products though, because this was expected.  I'm STILL using the products, and though my skin is better than it was 3 weeks ago, I'm basically back where I was when I started.  

I give up.  But I'm not giving up any more money to Murad

Like the others I was disappointed after a couple times using this product.  And like the others I started to breakout where I had not broken out before, on my forehead etc.  I bought this product because I had problem areas.  Using this product brought out more problem areas and dried out my skin.  I used the product as prescribed. 

The commercial said it was gentle and what made this product different from the rest was that it wouldn't cause acne only with it's "gentle" formula help it with immediate results.  NOT TRUE at all.  This is just like any other product on the market for acne.  If you have the Weeks of pain and suffering and embarrassing breakouts more than what you had before to get results, this is the product for you.  I, on the other hand, couldn't deal with the additional embarrassment of my skin getting worse before it got better.  When my trouble areas weren't that bad in the first place.

Not recommended as they advertise.  They aren't different than the others.  Proactive does the same thing.

This product should be listed only for people with REALLY oily skin.  It dried my combination skin out so bad that it got red, flaky, and it hurt!  I also got horrible pimples all over my face due to over drying.  This is actually harsher than Proactive.. Unless your skin covered in oil,  it probably wont be able to handle it.  Good luck getting your refund, I'm still waiting for mine.  I also cancelled the shipments twice and they keep charging me and sending them

I first smelled this perfume on a strip in a magazine. I fell in love with both the bottle, and the scent instantaneously. I decided when I had some extra cash I would buy it or hopefully drop enough hints to get it for Christmas. Christmas came and went and no Fantasy, instead I recieved Celine Dion's fragrance. I liked the smell of the Dion but was still sad that I didn't get what I wanted. I decided to buy the fantasy for myself. Upon finding it at a makeup counter I became rather thankful I got the other. I think Fantasy smells a lot like this cotton candy spray I had in elementary school. mmmm to smell like a 4th grader again. The bottle is elegant, but the scent is juvenile. It'd be appropriate for preteens, but not grown women, then again, should I be surprised? I suppose the scent caters well to Spears' followers, 12 year olds

I really wanted to like this one but just couldn't get past the smell.   It was really over-powering.  Lush makes some really lovely smelling soaps but this isn't one of them.  I didn't find it drying though and it did lather very nicely.  It was just too strongly scented for my liking

I didn't know you were supposed to peel that waxy rubbery black stuff off the soap...I normally get store-bought olive oil soap but it smelled so good, I had to try it.  I ended up COVERED with black, waxy streaks all over my body when I got out of the shower!  They didn't rinse off, either.  The only thing that seemed to work was to rub really vigorously with a towel...I still had black smudges and a wax residue.  Once I figured out how to take a knife to the coating, I had a better opinion of the soap, except that it pretty much cut the soap in half.  It smelled really nice, but I don't think I would get this again.

I generally love Lush soaps, but do not recommend this one. Demon in the Dark has a great name, but it doesn't smell very good (a sort of faint, slightly minty scent). It also has a black wax coating that is rather difficult to peel or scrape off, but must be removed for the soap to work properly.  I would try Red Rooster or Karma soap instead

Ick.  I bought Ultra Light Kirsch because I thought it would be similar to a discontinued grapey color that I used to love by Loreal.

Smell - Fake grade-school grape-aid smell grossed me out.

Feel - I LIKE lip gloss that feels glossy.  This stuff did not shine enough or last long enough.

Color - The color was to mild for me.  

I was very disappointed.  I felt like I had wasted money and time. I still recommend Loreal Lip Juice, though. I believe it's the same company, and Lip Juice is glossy, shiny, long-lasting and way more cost-effective

I had very high hopes for this cream, as it appears they went the extra mile for quality. Not so. The cream when used leaves alot of friction as the razor goes over your face, making for some tense moments that should not be there.
I have used many creams. So far Art of Shaving is the best. Casswell Massey is ok as is Aveda. Avoid Truefitt.

Update. 
Trufitt and Hill accepted the return and we spoke about the problems. They sent me a new updated extra fine version that should be available to the public now that is of the same quality as Massey. It is good. The standard is still substandard

I received this as a Christmas gift and loved the smell of it.  After my second time using it, I broke out in a terrible itchy rash. There is a warning on the bottle that it may cause skin and urinary tract irritation.  Do not buy it if you have even mildly sensitive skin.  The smell is great, but is gone after you get out of the shower.

I just used this product in a bath. It's supposed to be a Cinnamon smelling bubble bath, shampoo rinse, shower gel. Well first of all, I almost had to swallow my own lungs to smell any cinnamon, this is REALLY weak smelling. (I am a real scent meister too.) I used it as a bubble bath, guess what? The bubbles were gone within minutes. Stick with the Avon bubble bath, it still has bubbles in the tub when you are done! Then I used it as a shampoo. Guess what? It didn't lather! I ended up using the trusty Suave to finish the bath. Very disapointing product! I bought the 32oz. for myself as a Christmas present, can't wait till it's gone

I have worked with two women who have worn this perfume, and frankly, I can't stand the smell of it. It doesn't even smell like perfume, it is like some bizarre animal musk. There are no floral notes, and no woodsy notes, either; nothing clean or fresh or pleasant. I wish this perfume didn't exist---I hate it.

I have thick coarse hair and was looking for something to make it softer.  I Used just a little bit and it was really greasy.  I am currently using Lanza Anti Aging Plant Serum.  It works much better

I wouldn't recommend this product to a person with long hair like myself. After using this so called "Instant detangler" my hair was more tangled then ever. In my opinion any cheap hair conditioner from a drug store will do a better job

I was very unhappy with this product. First the shipping took way too long. Second, the tube is much smaller than sold at Macy's and the cost is more. And the contents were gross, very goopy. Not smooth. Like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months. I'll fight the mall to buy this next time

My sister-in-law bought this product for me after I had admired the shade (Purr, a light baby pink color) that she was wearing. I have used other MAC products before with great results, but was VERY dissapointed with this product. 

First of all, I gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. However, this product is sticky. VERY sticky! It does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. Not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. When I wear a lip gloss, I want to be soft and smooth feeling. I want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak. 

Also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. This will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. Very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!  

This product seems to be popular with other viewers, however, I would never reccomend this to anyone

This product will claim to be on the same level of the tools that dermatologists use to extract blackheads.  But don't count on any instructions included to tell you how to use this little rod. 

I did some searching on the Internet for a clue, and all directions simply said you press the loop firmly against the blackhead to extract the comedones.  Well that left a red circle on my face and made tears come out of my eyes ...but left the blackhead firmly in place.

If there is a better way to use this tool I highly doubt it will produce effective results.  There is simply nothing unique or different about the little metal loops than the end of your fingers.  Don't waste your money on this pathetic product

It only takes a little bit of reading to realize that abrading the skin with a piece of metal is NOT the solution for ending blackheads/enlarged pores. Using this "extractor" is equal to using one's fingers to squeeze out imperfections, which may produce very temporary results, but is ultimately fruitless. Those who feel a need to purchase this device should invest in professional deep-cleaning instead, which will rid the skin of excess oil and help the pores to close without aggravation

I used herbalism for a few weeks after discovering lush products through a friend. My face, esp. my forehead became very greasy, and every pore on my forehead became inflamed. I thought it was stress and continued using it until my next lush run when they gave me a sample of aquamarina. My face cleared up instantly. When the aquamarina ran out I went back to herbalism, but -surprise- the skin problems reemerged. Now, I'm using aquamarina instead and love it, though you can't get it through amazon for some reason. Check the lush website. I'm sure this won't happen to everyone, but give that pink glop a try instead

Disappointingly, this tape did not perform as well as hoped. It was unable to hold medium or heavier weight fabrics in place. Using a one-inch piece under bra straps did not keep them from slipping, the tape and straps eventually started rolling. And it definitely was unable to help prevent a strapless bra from succumbing to Newton's law of gravity! So not only did fashion faux-pas continue to occur, the tape caused a rash/skin irritation with each use.

At 23, I don't have "age" wrinkles around my eyes, but I have laugh lines that I want to soften. This product has done nothing for my laugh lines. I could have spent the same amount of money on something else that works. Skin growth factors available on ebay helped rebuild the skin in the creases of my laugh lines. This product did not.

I was talked into buying this product for minor fine lines. This product that I used for 4 months, showed no signifigant results as well as any other product Ive used by Estee Lauder. Dont waste your money on it. I usually look at it like this. If any cosmetic retailer offer a free gift with purchase it usually needs one to go with it. This product is crap!

Why did Shiseido have to ruin a good idea with a sub-par SPF? They got the broad spectrum part correct by using Avobenzone as the active sunscreen ingredient but then came up far short to the widely preferred SPF 15. UVA/UVB SPF 15 or more is a standard widely recommended by dermatologists, the Skin Cancer Foundation, the American Academy of Dermatology, and others. Plus, as a moisturizer, this one is just OK. There are far better formulations on the market, even some made by Shiseido, containing not only a better daily sunscreen but antioxidents and better moisturizing ingredients

I bought TendSkin to help with the irritation and razor bumps I get on my neck from shaving. The product claims to, "reduce appearance of unsightly razor bumps, ingrown hairs, and redness from shaving." But despite it's lofty promises and high price, it does none of this. In fact in my case it made the irritation and red bumps worse, I have sensitive skin and the main ingredient of this product is alcohol. The directions tell you to apply it after shaving, but because alcohol dries out your skin and is painful to apply after shaving, it only made my problem worse. I wish I could have rated this product zero stars, because it is absolutely worthless

I used Tend Skin for a few years and it was the best one that I could find but a few weeks ago I saw a nother product on Amazon called Solution 2 and ordered it instead.  I was a little worried because I was getting good results with the bumps with Tend Skin but it burned a lot and dried out my skin quite a bit.  Solution 2 is definitely a better product for me with my sensitive skin and it works just as good on the bumps

I used this product a few times, trying to justify the money I spent.  I could leave it on my hair all day, and the effect was essentially zilch.  Hair is dead.  It doesn't matter what propaganda beauty/cosmetics companies use to promote their products, there is no way that vitamins, minerals, etc. are going to "feed" or strengthen your hair.  When the products are washed out, so is the moisture.  It was a dumb idea on my part to think putting guacamole on my hair was going to make it a)smell good b)feel good.  And it was really dumb of me to pay so much for this stuff when I could've just as easily and much more cheaply made it myself

I think I may have had a bad batch because when I read the reviews on how yummy it had smelled, made me curious. So, I tried it and I hated it! The smell of it turned my stomach. It did soften my hair a bit, but I don't recommend using it again. Sorry Lush

Let me just say that I have thick, dry frizzy hair with an oily scalp. And this shampoo bar made it an even bigger mess. It dried my hair out even more and made it so hard to manage. The smell was really good at first, very coconuty. But then after a few uses it developed a weird scent, like playdoh and pepper. So I just used up the rest of it as regular soap. It has made me somewhat wary of trying other solid shampoo bars

I tried phyto index #1 and basically, its a waste of cash.  You can get the same deal at the grocery store and it'll probably do a better job.  Let me describe my hair.  I am black, my hair is thin and breaks easily.  I can not have too heavy moisterizers because it weighs my hair down I will lose the bounce in my hair, so I always use serum.  I style my hair by blow drying and using a ceramic flat iron to get it straight, flowing, and bouncy.  The relaxer almost seem like it didn't take.  I haven't had a relaxer to do that in ages. I put this in almost a month ago and I can't wait until it grows out to put some real relaxer in.  

Also, everytime I would do a touch up, my hair would stop shedding.  With Phyto index #1, it sheds more!  With breakage strands.  I'm ok with root strands shedding, that's natural.  Next time, I will either order Mitzani relaxer online or go to a professional to put that in.  Mitzani is one of my favorites.  Number #1 is Silk II (I have no idea how to get that).  As for homekits, Optimum is good.

I was really excited for this! I hoped it would be a faster, easier way to do make up and what not, but its not.
It smears like crazy, and the end is so sharp, it hurts to apply. But that doesn't matter!
the end stops working after a use or two.
I suppose if you wanted to do make up similar to a raccoon with blueish eyes (for the black is more navy then black) you'll be happy.
I've always loved the mark products, but this is a disappointment

At first it smells very sharp and citrusy, almost like men's cologne. Then few seconds later it mellows out a bit and smells somewhat herbal. After 15 minutes you won't be able to smell it at all. Very hyped up mediocre perfume with very steep price tag. You'd be better off buying a bottle of Herbal Essence shower gel and getting identical results

I bought this product mainly because my daughter has fair, sensitive skin, which most facial wipes cause her minor irritation. This product worked very well as far as thoroughly cleaning her face, hands etc. It did not irritate her skin at all...the problem, the one and only problem, is the fragrance, if you can call it that. It stinks so bad, I did not want to go near her after I wiped her down...I had to give her a bath, it was so bad

The beads in this ice pack do not get cold at all. It gets a little cold, but warms up in about 45 seconds. I also noticed very little over all effects from using it

i got this bar based on the other reviews, and boy, is it strong! the bar will last a very good long while, unless you can actually stomach the smell of gallons of patchouli without getting a major headache. patchouli was originally supposed to be a base scent for other sweeter scents to sit upon. it was never supposed to be a stand-alone perfume! 
like all the LUSH bubble bars, this definitely packs the bubbles in a small amount. i just have buyers remorse because i now have this oversized bar (and it is a very big bar), and i can only use bits of it when my fiance is out of town because he gets an allergic reaction to the strong strong STRONG smell. 
i think the upside is that it seems like the scent isn't nearly so strong once you're actually *in* the bath. or maybe by then your olfactory senses are so overwhelmed you just can't tell the difference anymore.
so yeah, if you love love LOOOOOOOOVE patchouli, then this is truly the bath bar for you. otherwise, i'd steer clear and go for something gentler. the hot milk bubble bar is the opposite of this bar, in that it's really gentle on the nose. and any of the jasmine flavored products would also be a better recommendation than this one.
i love LUSH, but not this bar

I've ordered this product a month ago.  I had mild acne, I've used a lot of Benzoyl Peroxide products etc persagel, Clearasil, etc.  One day I saw a commerical for this Murad product, which looked too good to be true.  I've ordered the product because the price was cheaper than some of the other products and it had "real people" saying the product worked.  I did follow the instructions on the 3 products.  Less than a week, my face broke out even more, I had some cystic acne which I never had before.  It was astonishing, but the company said there was a "purging" state, which I held out hope that it would be a minor setback.  2 weeks later, again I started breaking out on both sides of my face and under my neck and chin area.  I am so dumbfounded that this product said it would make a difference within a month.  It's been 1 month and 3 weeks and I am so disappointed.  I've stop using this product for the last 3 days and my skin is getting better and I've cancelled any future products from this company.  DON'T RECOMMEND IT

I developed mild acne after deciding to go off of my regular birth control pill.  Never having acne before, this was devistating.  I watched all the infomercials and decided to go with Murad's Acne Complex Kit expecting the glowing, perfect skin that they promised within a few short weeks.  I purchased the starter kit and I liked the smell of the products but after a month and a half, I was still experiencing bad breakouts.  I even had the really painful acne that are so deep it takes weeks for them to come to the surface!  I continued to use the second shipment of Murad because everything I read said that the purging cycle could take 4 or more weeks.  I spent 3 months and over $60 on this stuff without results.  Silly me, I was going to order more but I started reading reviews for my only alternative, Proactiv.  Now that stuff isn't any cheaper in the long run but someone else mentioned Acne Free in their review and I figured that it was worth a try.  I found it at my local Walreens for $19.  Let me tell you, I used Acne Free for 2, TWO, days and saw results that I had not seen in 3 months of using the expensive stuff.  I can't say enough about it.  I'm thrilled that something so easy to get would work so much better than any hyped up product.  Goes to show, don't buy from T.V.

Wasn't anything special. You can go to any beauty supply store and get a similar oil that's half the price.
