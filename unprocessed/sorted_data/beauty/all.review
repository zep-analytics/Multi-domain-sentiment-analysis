I bought this because I have fine hair that needs to be washed every day and I get tired of washing it.  I thought I could use this every other day and get by. 

However, it doesn't make your hair look freshly washed; it is just ok.  It takes "bed head" hair and makes it look acceptable for a little while.  After a couple of hours though, my hair looks oily and stringy again.

I use it before I take the kids to school and it gets me thru the morning.  Then I end up washing my hair later

I like Jonathan Anton &amp; some of his products, but this one was a very bad one.  It smelled like swamp water.  His other products smell great.  I don't know what happened to this one.

I bought this because a friend had it and it smelled wonderfully of roses.  There must be a quality control problem.  My bottle had no noticible, pleasant sent and therefore did nothing to freshen my hair.  I was only trying to go 1 day without washing.  What a disappointing product and a waste of my money.  :

After using this product, I felt less than fresh.  Then I realized that it is only for use on the hair and skin on your head.  I would have been better off using a can of Evain spray and gotten the same effect at less money

I was again disappointed as this did not make me feel "fresh".  In fact if you mix it with the Dirt in your hair it causes some type of nasty reaction and your hair becomes sticky and gooey - nothing fresh about it.

I saw Jonathan on QVC and was really impressed with the claim that the Moisturizing Conditioner was great for dry/damaged hair.  He also said that his products don't strip the color out of hair like some of the brands on the market.  I color and highlight my hair and wanted something that would protect it.  What a disapointment.  The conditioner bottle is horrible at dispensing even a small amount of conditioner.  I had to remove the lid.  Then, it's like paste...doesn't seem to go through the hair..even after 3 minutes.  When I tried to comb my hair out, it was like a birds nest.  I had to put a spray leave in conditioner, by another line, in my hair just to comb through it.  I ordered it from QVC...and it's going back

I WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT!  I WAS GIVEN THE SHAMPOO FOR CHRISTMAS WHICH WHEN WASHING MY HAIR MADE LITTLE TO NO SUDS.  WHEN TRYING TO COMB OUT MY HAIR AFTER SHAMPOOING IT WAS LIKE A BEES NEST AND I COULDN'T POSSIBLY GET A COMB THRU IT.  THATS WHEN I ORDERED THE CONDITIONER WHICH WAS LIKE CAKE BATTER AND COULDN'T GET IT TO COME OUT OF THE CONTAINER WITH REALLY QUEEZING IT WHICH MADE THE LETTERING COME OFF ON TO YOUR HANDS AND I FOUND SOME IN MY HAIR. I SQUEEZE AND BANG UNTIL I FINALLY GET A BIG LUMP COMING OUT.  I HAD WATCHED ALL OF JONATHAN'S REALITY SHOWS WHEN HE WAS WORKING ON CREATING HIS PRODUCTS AND COULDN'T WAIT TO TRY THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL NATURAL. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!  I RECENTLY SAW HIS SHOW BACK TV WHERE SOMEONE CALLS HIM UP AND SAYS THEY TRIED HIS PRODUCT AND HOW HAPPY THEY WERE AND JONATHAN GETS ALL CHOCKED UP.  I WAS SCREAMING AT THE TV I WAS SO UPSET.  THE PRODUCT WAS NOT CHEAP AND CAN'T BELIEVE I CAN'T USE SOMETHING I SPENT SO MUCH MONEY ON.

On a scale of 1 to 5, the packaging gets a negative 1. You can't sqeeze the conditioner out of the bottle, ended up removing top.

For value of product, Jonathan gets a 1.

For quality of product 3.

The conditioner feels like vegetable shortening or softened butter. Need to use more than average. The conditioner is average in detangling and after using it four times it does condition your hair, but no better than other quality brands. I do like that it seems to cut down on the drying time, but Bed Head has a similar product that's been out for a while. For that option I would rather choose Bed Head for quality and price

I had high hopes for this stuff. I have watched Blow Out and know that he knows his stuff when it comes to hair, but I cant seem to get this stuff to actually do anything for my curls and waves. I have tried it on wet hair, damp hair, dry hair-no discernable difference. I will stick to my Frederic Fekkai products-they actually work

I spent a lot of money on this product &amp; waited with anticipation for it to arrive. When I applied it, it did nothing to "create" curl and didn't even define the curls that I already had. My hair was limp and frizzy by days end. It smelled nice &amp; that's about it. Cheap-o Suave gel or mousse works better and creating and holding curl

RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN... DO NOT TRY!  Okay, so I bought in to the hype of "Blow Out".  Once I saw the "JONATHAN" product line on the shelf, I thought, "Hmmm, how yummy!"  Boy, was I disappointed.  The moisturizing shampoo was anything but!  The product felt like a mixture of tree sap and glue.  Once applied to the hair, I felt knots forming.  Upon rinsing, my hair like it had been stripped!  I used lots of the companion conditioner hoping for a balancing act, but was left aghast when I rinsed and felt the "new" texture of my hair.  I couldn't comb it out with a wide tooth comb until I applied a leave in conditioner from another product line!  Once dry, my hair felt gritty, brittle and generally nasty.  I'M TAKING THIS STUFF BACK AND DEMANDING A REFUND!  I'm going back to my Frederick Fekkai products immediately

Watching the show I thought that Jonathan really cared about hair and its no doubt that he does still but his shampoo leaves alot to be desired. For example, even in the hot, very humid atmosphere of Houston, TX it left my hair feeling dry and unhealthy, even after using his conditioner (alot of it). My hair looks awful after using it. And the bottle claims that it doesn't use toxic ingredients like MEA but it DOES use three different types of PEG, a petroleum based thicker found in most bath products that can erode wooden tables in just minutes. This is just as harmful as MEA, especially for people with sensitive scalps and hair. And it claims not to strip your hair but the products that are supposed to cleanse are much less apparent in the product than the PEG products. Since PEG is a thickener, you're also getting a diluted, toxic, solution. Even though Head and shoulders uses MEA I find that that even that works better than this. My hair doesn't feel like it has any more of its essential oils and I've switched back to the other hair products Iv'e been using. It's not worth your 20 dollars, its barely worth 5 dollars. My hair stylist also recommended Dove products if you need hydration. DON'T BUY IT!

I used a sample and liked the fact that it cleaned my hair the way I want my hair cleaned.
 Not washed with useless lather and coated with all kind of smoothening silicon products. People have beconme so used to the mass produced garbage that is sold in gorcery stores, that they do not realize they are paying for detergent. In the long run it is damaging for the hair and after some hours it really does not have that nice clean bounce that hair is supposed to have.
Jonathan is not the only good product out there. I have been using Phyto Shampoo from France and Kiehl's, both don't have the silicon smoothers either and yes, the hair does feel like straw right after you wash it. Get a big tooth comb and some guts and go through life with really clean hair!!!!
I used my sample and will buy a big bottle of the Shampoo. I have not tried the conditioner, but will try it too.

Is this shampoo or sap??  What exactly is it supposed to do??  I received a sample of this shampoo and I am ever so glad I got to try it free before I actually spent money on it.  Not only did my hair feel like straw, as mentioned by other reviewers, but it was so heavy I couldn't do anything except rewash it with my regular shampoo.  I'll save this one for Halloween.

I see several previous reviews that acknowledge the fact that this shampoo leaves your hair feeling like "straw" yet say that is because this shampoo leaves your hair so clean!  Are you kidding me?  If having "clean" hair means having my hair feel like straw and it does literally feel like straw, then I'll happily return to having "dirty" hair...seriously, I've had smoother, softer hair from drugstore shampoos that cost .99 than this 20 dollar shampoo and conditioner!  I could not even run a comb through my hair while it was wet because this product left my hair feeling so rough! I have rather dry hair, and I merely tried this product on a lark, just to see if it was any good because I am a fan of Jonathan and his show, so I will return to my drugstore shampoo, Dove and Pantene which have always worked well for my dry hair.

Okay, I'll admit. I bought into the hype. Oooo, no "sulfates"... Oooo, "essential water".... Oooo, "all natural" - no animals sacrificed in the making or testing of this - "vegan" shampoo and conditioner...

I headed into the shower with confidence that I had finally dumped $35 on a shampoo and conditioner set that would make a difference to my fine straight hair. And what a difference it made...the volume created by the products was all flyaway hair: styled by the static electricity generated by my hair being devoided of any moisture that it once held by this lovely "dessicant" shampoo. And no amount of the so-called conditioner helped to right the wrong! I tried various amounts of conditioner and left it on for longer and longer periods of time without any change in results. After 3 days of feeling the wicked witch of the west was having better hair days than I was, I returned the product.

This product truly deserves 0 stars!!

I was excited to purchase Jonathan product after watching two seasons of Blow Out.  Unfortunately, I was really disappointed after using this conditioner on my hair.  My hair is very thick and after using this conditioner it left my hair a sticky and tangled mess.

Unfortunately, the fragrance of the conditioner is great but that's about it

I purchased this item after seeing Jonathan's show.  As much as I enjoyed his program, I am sorry to say that this product is just terrible.  It weighed down my hair, and made my hair look greasy before I was even done styling!  The day after using the product, my hair looked like an oil slick!  I DO wish Jonathan much success, but these products need a lot of work.  Very disappointing after spending almost 60$ for two bottles that remain full in the back of my cupboard

My naturally curly hair is thinning and I thought this conditioner would be helpful. The conditioner did not handle the tangles in my hair nor did it make it feel conditioned. I thought it was too drippy. I nearly used half a bottle by pouring it into my hand. I would not recommend this conditioner

This product totally frizzed out my hair. I had been having good luck for once with Paul Mitchell's foaming mousse. This Jonathan product,sadly, rather than taming my hair, induced the frizz. A lot. Perhaps a stronger formula is needed, or maybe I just don't have fine, limp enough hair I was very sad

I have dried my hair daily for 20 years now. I bought the T3 Tourmaline with great excitement. Come on - its 200$, the most I have ever used on a hairdryer. I did NOT reduce my hair drying time at all, but it did make my hair less frizzy and more shiny..But all in all- too much money for too little help!

I'm sure that this hair dryer is of exceptional quality - perhaps worth the price to some. But I'd be careful about buying something that uses fake science babble to try to convince you of its effectiveness. "most ionic and infrared" is gibberish. Tourmaline, a gemstone, has electrical properties (when squeezed or heated, it develops a charge across the crystal), but that has nothing to do with hair drying, or ionizing air, or anything else. I'd recommend buying a less expensive but still high-quality hair dryer instead of falling for a pseudoscientific scam

I bought this lipgloss at my local Sephora store. First of all..DO NOT EXPECT TO SEE ANY PLUMPING WHAT SO EVER. It makes No difference in how your lips look. Secondly, it takes forever to get the gloss to come out on the rolly ball. The ONLY reason this gloss is $18 is because of the Too Faced name brand. DONT waste your money on this when there are lipglosses just as good/better for a few bucks at the drugstor

I would absolutley love this product if it came with an apllicator brush instead of a roller ball. The roller ball hardly lets any of the gloss come out, and you find yourself rolling it over &amp; over again to get a decent amount of gloss. The gloss itself is pretty(once you get enough on your lips.) And it does taste &amp; smell delicious. But it is way too much trouble with the roller ball. I would suggest they make this with an applicator brush. It would make a great product

I previously left a very positive review of the shampoo and conditioner, however, after using it for several days, my hair feels heavy, dirty and coated with something.  I know Jonathan loves his product "Dirt" but it does not belong in a volumizing product for women with fine, limp hair.  I don't need anything else to weight my hair down.  It does not feel clean after washing and drying it.  I am quite disappointed as I really loved the way both products smelled. I had to wash my hair a second time today because it would not do what I wanted it to do and it felt like the "second day" after washing it. I still recommend the volumizing foam.  That is a nice product.  Smells wonderful and does not weight your hair down or cause it to become full of static as products with a lot of alcohol do.

Not sure what is in this stuff but it turns my fairly healthy hair into the texture of straw.  Even my own sylist said, whatever you are using...STOP..you hair feels very damaged.  It goes back to normal texture if I use my other shampoos.  I made sure to use it on and off to be sure it was the Jonathan shampoo..and it was.  It went into the trash.  Don't purchase this stuff...unless you're going for the scarecrow look

I was so excited to try this "amazing-hyped" shampoo,I bought the kit from QVC.All I can say is what a disaster.My hair which is coarse,it instantly turned to straw. No lather,horrible tangles,the conditioner did not help at all (left it on for 10-15 min).I also contacted Jonathan Procduct,Inc(4) times and left messages for them to please call me to discuss the problem with their product. NO RESPONSE! All Hype-No Action! Don't waste your money. $60 is alot to pay for itchy dry hair.If you look in beauty supply stores there are other brands that are sulfate-free also, such as Mastey(Code Red

After the debacle that was Dirt I tried to repair the damage by making my now filthy looking hair shiny.  Well now my hair was not only dirty it was shiny and dirty.  Is this a joke.  I am sure that Jonathan was not trying to deceive people by charging such exorbitant prices for a hair cut if he was not a man of substance and yet here I am trying to wash this out of my hair, with his very shampoo and all I have is tears. Clearly this is not Product Without Tears.

If you want your hair to feel like it has day old elementary school vanilla pudding in your hair then this is a 5 star product for ya!  If you like your hair clean and nice, pass on this.  I tried this, and my god anything I rested my head on; chairs, car seats, pillows, my boyfriend, my child! was left with a greasy gooey stain on it.  Seriously  I think this stuff is going to cost me more in cleaning bills then anything else I have ever used on my body.  And I still have the original hair damage in my dern hair!!!  Maybe if he had killed an animal or 2 for this product I would not be left with this mess.

I bought the Tourmaline hoping to save time, because I have very thick, wavy hair that takes 45 minutes to dry and straighten.  It ended up taking just as long, but the results were much better.  My hair was super straight and shiny, and it didn't get frizzy even in humid weather.  Then when I was using it for just the 4th time, it completely stopped working.  Just as other people described, the red light shut off and it cooled down, and never turned back on.  I'm in the process of trying to get a refund or replacement now.

I received this as a gift.  I was thrilled with the results the first few times I used it.  Then the little red light went out while I was straightening my hair and it has never worked since.  I only got to use it three times

My Review

<review_text>
I bought this product at Sephora.  I had it for about two weeks and used it only 2 times.  When I tried to use it after that, the little red light wouldn't come on and it just wouldn't work.  I took it back to Sephora for an exchange since I was still within the 30 day exchange period.  The second one worked for about two months...then the SAME thing happened.  I was only using it maybe once or twice a week, the most.  This product is horrible.  I never dropped it or anything like that.  In fact, as soon as it would cool down after using, I would place it back in the box it came in.  I am actually in the process of returning it to the manufacturer.  Honestly, I wanted a good flat iron and I thought this was a good product because it was expensive...BIG MISTAKE.  My friend bought a straight iron for about $100 and she's had it for almost a year.  She also straightens her hair a lot more often than I do.  I don't know why I didn't ask her where she got hers.  Please read all the reviews before you make this purchase.  If you don't believe me, wait to see if someone you know buys it so you can find out first hand how bad this product is.

this product did not dry my hair as described on the box.  It did straighten my hair, but that was all.  I had to dry my hair with a blow dryer and then use this T3 iron which eliminates the whole reason for buying it.

On my third use, I set it down on the carry case and it sizzled. I looked more closely and it started shooting sparks out of the cord, right where it is connected to the handle! I immediately unplugged it, and now there's a hole in it where the sparks were coming out. I am so grateful I wasn't using it on my hair when this happened! What with the straightening balm I was using and everything, my hair could've easily started on fire

I have to say that for a gel it had the same consistency and feel of K-y jelly - frankly I am not familiar with personal lubricants but that said there was the smell that reminded me of my gynecological exams.

I saw Jonathan on QVC and was really impressed with the claim that the Moisturizing Conditioner was great for dry/damaged hair.  He also said that his products don't strip the color out of hair like some of the brands on the market.  I color and highlight my hair and wanted something that would protect it.  What a disapointment.  The conditioner bottle is horrible at dispensing even a small amount of conditioner.  I had to remove the lid.  Then, it's like paste...doesn't seem to go through the hair..even after 3 minutes.  When I tried to comb my hair out, it was like a birds nest.  I had to put a spray leave in conditioner, by another line, in my hair just to comb through it.  I ordered it from QVC...and it's going back

I WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT!  I WAS GIVEN THE SHAMPOO FOR CHRISTMAS WHICH WHEN WASHING MY HAIR MADE LITTLE TO NO SUDS.  WHEN TRYING TO COMB OUT MY HAIR AFTER SHAMPOOING IT WAS LIKE A BEES NEST AND I COULDN'T POSSIBLY GET A COMB THRU IT.  THATS WHEN I ORDERED THE CONDITIONER WHICH WAS LIKE CAKE BATTER AND COULDN'T GET IT TO COME OUT OF THE CONTAINER WITH REALLY QUEEZING IT WHICH MADE THE LETTERING COME OFF ON TO YOUR HANDS AND I FOUND SOME IN MY HAIR. I SQUEEZE AND BANG UNTIL I FINALLY GET A BIG LUMP COMING OUT.  I HAD WATCHED ALL OF JONATHAN'S REALITY SHOWS WHEN HE WAS WORKING ON CREATING HIS PRODUCTS AND COULDN'T WAIT TO TRY THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL NATURAL. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!  I RECENTLY SAW HIS SHOW BACK TV WHERE SOMEONE CALLS HIM UP AND SAYS THEY TRIED HIS PRODUCT AND HOW HAPPY THEY WERE AND JONATHAN GETS ALL CHOCKED UP.  I WAS SCREAMING AT THE TV I WAS SO UPSET.  THE PRODUCT WAS NOT CHEAP AND CAN'T BELIEVE I CAN'T USE SOMETHING I SPENT SO MUCH MONEY ON.

On a scale of 1 to 5, the packaging gets a negative 1. You can't sqeeze the conditioner out of the bottle, ended up removing top.

For value of product, Jonathan gets a 1.

For quality of product 3.

The conditioner feels like vegetable shortening or softened butter. Need to use more than average. The conditioner is average in detangling and after using it four times it does condition your hair, but no better than other quality brands. I do like that it seems to cut down on the drying time, but Bed Head has a similar product that's been out for a while. For that option I would rather choose Bed Head for quality and price

I bought this lipgloss at my local Sephora store. First of all..DO NOT EXPECT TO SEE ANY PLUMPING WHAT SO EVER. It makes No difference in how your lips look. Secondly, it takes forever to get the gloss to come out on the rolly ball. The ONLY reason this gloss is $18 is because of the Too Faced name brand. DONT waste your money on this when there are lipglosses just as good/better for a few bucks at the drugstor

I would absolutley love this product if it came with an apllicator brush instead of a roller ball. The roller ball hardly lets any of the gloss come out, and you find yourself rolling it over &amp; over again to get a decent amount of gloss. The gloss itself is pretty(once you get enough on your lips.) And it does taste &amp; smell delicious. But it is way too much trouble with the roller ball. I would suggest they make this with an applicator brush. It would make a great product

RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN... DO NOT TRY!  Okay, so I bought in to the hype of "Blow Out".  Once I saw the "JONATHAN" product line on the shelf, I thought, "Hmmm, how yummy!"  Boy, was I disappointed.  The moisturizing shampoo was anything but!  The product felt like a mixture of tree sap and glue.  Once applied to the hair, I felt knots forming.  Upon rinsing, my hair like it had been stripped!  I used lots of the companion conditioner hoping for a balancing act, but was left aghast when I rinsed and felt the "new" texture of my hair.  I couldn't comb it out with a wide tooth comb until I applied a leave in conditioner from another product line!  Once dry, my hair felt gritty, brittle and generally nasty.  I'M TAKING THIS STUFF BACK AND DEMANDING A REFUND!  I'm going back to my Frederick Fekkai products immediately

Watching the show I thought that Jonathan really cared about hair and its no doubt that he does still but his shampoo leaves alot to be desired. For example, even in the hot, very humid atmosphere of Houston, TX it left my hair feeling dry and unhealthy, even after using his conditioner (alot of it). My hair looks awful after using it. And the bottle claims that it doesn't use toxic ingredients like MEA but it DOES use three different types of PEG, a petroleum based thicker found in most bath products that can erode wooden tables in just minutes. This is just as harmful as MEA, especially for people with sensitive scalps and hair. And it claims not to strip your hair but the products that are supposed to cleanse are much less apparent in the product than the PEG products. Since PEG is a thickener, you're also getting a diluted, toxic, solution. Even though Head and shoulders uses MEA I find that that even that works better than this. My hair doesn't feel like it has any more of its essential oils and I've switched back to the other hair products Iv'e been using. It's not worth your 20 dollars, its barely worth 5 dollars. My hair stylist also recommended Dove products if you need hydration. DON'T BUY IT!

I used a sample and liked the fact that it cleaned my hair the way I want my hair cleaned.
 Not washed with useless lather and coated with all kind of smoothening silicon products. People have beconme so used to the mass produced garbage that is sold in gorcery stores, that they do not realize they are paying for detergent. In the long run it is damaging for the hair and after some hours it really does not have that nice clean bounce that hair is supposed to have.
Jonathan is not the only good product out there. I have been using Phyto Shampoo from France and Kiehl's, both don't have the silicon smoothers either and yes, the hair does feel like straw right after you wash it. Get a big tooth comb and some guts and go through life with really clean hair!!!!
I used my sample and will buy a big bottle of the Shampoo. I have not tried the conditioner, but will try it too.

Is this shampoo or sap??  What exactly is it supposed to do??  I received a sample of this shampoo and I am ever so glad I got to try it free before I actually spent money on it.  Not only did my hair feel like straw, as mentioned by other reviewers, but it was so heavy I couldn't do anything except rewash it with my regular shampoo.  I'll save this one for Halloween.

I see several previous reviews that acknowledge the fact that this shampoo leaves your hair feeling like "straw" yet say that is because this shampoo leaves your hair so clean!  Are you kidding me?  If having "clean" hair means having my hair feel like straw and it does literally feel like straw, then I'll happily return to having "dirty" hair...seriously, I've had smoother, softer hair from drugstore shampoos that cost .99 than this 20 dollar shampoo and conditioner!  I could not even run a comb through my hair while it was wet because this product left my hair feeling so rough! I have rather dry hair, and I merely tried this product on a lark, just to see if it was any good because I am a fan of Jonathan and his show, so I will return to my drugstore shampoo, Dove and Pantene which have always worked well for my dry hair.

This foam product by Jonathan is okay.  The reviews on his products are highly overrated.  The price doesn't bother me at all.  There are better foams for thin and limp hair

This product totally frizzed out my hair. I had been having good luck for once with Paul Mitchell's foaming mousse. This Jonathan product,sadly, rather than taming my hair, induced the frizz. A lot. Perhaps a stronger formula is needed, or maybe I just don't have fine, limp enough hair I was very sad

I previously left a very positive review of the shampoo and conditioner, however, after using it for several days, my hair feels heavy, dirty and coated with something.  I know Jonathan loves his product "Dirt" but it does not belong in a volumizing product for women with fine, limp hair.  I don't need anything else to weight my hair down.  It does not feel clean after washing and drying it.  I am quite disappointed as I really loved the way both products smelled. I had to wash my hair a second time today because it would not do what I wanted it to do and it felt like the "second day" after washing it. I still recommend the volumizing foam.  That is a nice product.  Smells wonderful and does not weight your hair down or cause it to become full of static as products with a lot of alcohol do.

Not sure what is in this stuff but it turns my fairly healthy hair into the texture of straw.  Even my own sylist said, whatever you are using...STOP..you hair feels very damaged.  It goes back to normal texture if I use my other shampoos.  I made sure to use it on and off to be sure it was the Jonathan shampoo..and it was.  It went into the trash.  Don't purchase this stuff...unless you're going for the scarecrow look

Okay, I'll admit. I bought into the hype.  Oooo, no "sulfates"...  Oooo, "essential water"....   Oooo, "all natural" - no animals sacrificed in the making or testing of this - "vegan" shampoo and conditioner...

I headed into the shower with confidence that I had finally dumped $35 on a shampoo and conditioner set that would make a difference to my fine straight hair.  And what a difference it made...the volume created by the products was all flyaway hair: styled by the static electricity generated by my hair being devoided of any moisture that it once held by this lovely "dessicant" shampoo.  And no amount of the so-called conditioner helped to right the wrong!   I tried various amounts of conditioner and left it on for longer and longer periods of time without any change in results.  After 3 days of feeling the wicked witch of the west was having better hair days than I was, I returned the product.

This product truly deserves 0 stars!!

I was so excited to try this "amazing-hyped" shampoo,I bought the kit from QVC.All I can say is what a disaster.My hair which is coarse,it instantly turned to straw. No lather,horrible tangles,the conditioner did not help at all (left it on for 10-15 min).I also contacted Jonathan Procduct,Inc(4) times and left messages for them to please call me to discuss the problem with their product. NO RESPONSE! All Hype-No Action! Don't waste your money. $60 is alot to pay for itchy dry hair.If you look in beauty supply stores there are other brands that are sulfate-free also, such as Mastey(Code Red

After the debacle that was Dirt I tried to repair the damage by making my now filthy looking hair shiny.  Well now my hair was not only dirty it was shiny and dirty.  Is this a joke.  I am sure that Jonathan was not trying to deceive people by charging such exorbitant prices for a hair cut if he was not a man of substance and yet here I am trying to wash this out of my hair, with his very shampoo and all I have is tears. Clearly this is not Product Without Tears.

If you want your hair to feel like it has day old elementary school vanilla pudding in your hair then this is a 5 star product for ya!  If you like your hair clean and nice, pass on this.  I tried this, and my god anything I rested my head on; chairs, car seats, pillows, my boyfriend, my child! was left with a greasy gooey stain on it.  Seriously  I think this stuff is going to cost me more in cleaning bills then anything else I have ever used on my body.  And I still have the original hair damage in my dern hair!!!  Maybe if he had killed an animal or 2 for this product I would not be left with this mess.

I bought the Tourmaline hoping to save time, because I have very thick, wavy hair that takes 45 minutes to dry and straighten.  It ended up taking just as long, but the results were much better.  My hair was super straight and shiny, and it didn't get frizzy even in humid weather.  Then when I was using it for just the 4th time, it completely stopped working.  Just as other people described, the red light shut off and it cooled down, and never turned back on.  I'm in the process of trying to get a refund or replacement now.

I bought this product at Sephora.  I had it for about two weeks and used it only 2 times.  When I tried to use it after that, the little red light wouldn't come on and it just wouldn't work.  I took it back to Sephora for an exchange since I was still within the 30 day exchange period.  The second one worked for about two months...then the SAME thing happened.  I was only using it maybe once or twice a week, the most.  This product is horrible.  I never dropped it or anything like that.  In fact, as soon as it would cool down after using, I would place it back in the box it came in.  I am actually in the process of returning it to the manufacturer.  Honestly, I wanted a good flat iron and I thought this was a good product because it was expensive...BIG MISTAKE.  My friend bought a straight iron for about $100 and she's had it for almost a year.  She also straightens her hair a lot more often than I do.  I don't know why I didn't ask her where she got hers.  Please read all the reviews before you make this purchase.  If you don't believe me, wait to see if someone you know buys it so you can find out first hand how bad this product is.

this product did not dry my hair as described on the box.  It did straighten my hair, but that was all.  I had to dry my hair with a blow dryer and then use this T3 iron which eliminates the whole reason for buying it.

On my third use, I set it down on the carry case and it sizzled. I looked more closely and it started shooting sparks out of the cord, right where it is connected to the handle! I immediately unplugged it, and now there's a hole in it where the sparks were coming out. I am so grateful I wasn't using it on my hair when this happened! What with the straightening balm I was using and everything, my hair could've easily started on fire

This product works well when I use it with a curling iron.  The low rating is for the cost.  I just don't think it is worth over $20

I have dried my hair daily for 20 years now. I bought the T3 Tourmaline with great excitement. Come on - its 200$, the most I have ever used on a hairdryer. I did NOT reduce my hair drying time at all, but it did make my hair less frizzy and more shiny..But all in all- too much money for too little help!

I'm sure that this hair dryer is of exceptional quality - perhaps worth the price to some. But I'd be careful about buying something that uses fake science babble to try to convince you of its effectiveness. "most ionic and infrared" is gibberish. Tourmaline, a gemstone, has electrical properties (when squeezed or heated, it develops a charge across the crystal), but that has nothing to do with hair drying, or ionizing air, or anything else. I'd recommend buying a less expensive but still high-quality hair dryer instead of falling for a pseudoscientific scam

I bought this because I have fine hair that needs to be washed every day and I get tired of washing it.  I thought I could use this every other day and get by. 

However, it doesn't make your hair look freshly washed; it is just ok.  It takes "bed head" hair and makes it look acceptable for a little while.  After a couple of hours though, my hair looks oily and stringy again.

I use it before I take the kids to school and it gets me thru the morning.  Then I end up washing my hair later

I bought this because a friend had it and it smelled wonderfully of roses.  There must be a quality control problem.  My bottle had no noticible, pleasant sent and therefore did nothing to freshen my hair.  I was only trying to go 1 day without washing.  What a disappointing product and a waste of my money.  :

After using this product, I felt less than fresh.  Then I realized that it is only for use on the hair and skin on your head.  I would have been better off using a can of Evain spray and gotten the same effect at less money

I was again disappointed as this did not make me feel "fresh".  In fact if you mix it with the Dirt in your hair it causes some type of nasty reaction and your hair becomes sticky and gooey - nothing fresh about it.

I have to say that for a gel it had the same consistency and feel of K-y jelly - frankly I am not familiar with personal lubricants but that said there was the smell that reminded me of my gynecological exams.

I had high hopes for this stuff. I have watched Blow Out and know that he knows his stuff when it comes to hair, but I cant seem to get this stuff to actually do anything for my curls and waves. I have tried it on wet hair, damp hair, dry hair-no discernable difference. I will stick to my Frederic Fekkai products-they actually work

I spent a lot of money on this product &amp; waited with anticipation for it to arrive. When I applied it, it did nothing to "create" curl and didn't even define the curls that I already had. My hair was limp and frizzy by days end. It smelled nice &amp; that's about it. Cheap-o Suave gel or mousse works better and creating and holding curl

Okay, I'll admit. I bought into the hype. Oooo, no "sulfates"... Oooo, "essential water".... Oooo, "all natural" - no animals sacrificed in the making or testing of this - "vegan" shampoo and conditioner...

I headed into the shower with confidence that I had finally dumped $35 on a shampoo and conditioner set that would make a difference to my fine straight hair. And what a difference it made...the volume created by the products was all flyaway hair: styled by the static electricity generated by my hair being devoided of any moisture that it once held by this lovely "dessicant" shampoo. And no amount of the so-called conditioner helped to right the wrong! I tried various amounts of conditioner and left it on for longer and longer periods of time without any change in results. After 3 days of feeling the wicked witch of the west was having better hair days than I was, I returned the product.

This product truly deserves 0 stars!!

I was excited to purchase Jonathan product after watching two seasons of Blow Out.  Unfortunately, I was really disappointed after using this conditioner on my hair.  My hair is very thick and after using this conditioner it left my hair a sticky and tangled mess.

Unfortunately, the fragrance of the conditioner is great but that's about it

I purchased this item after seeing Jonathan's show.  As much as I enjoyed his program, I am sorry to say that this product is just terrible.  It weighed down my hair, and made my hair look greasy before I was even done styling!  The day after using the product, my hair looked like an oil slick!  I DO wish Jonathan much success, but these products need a lot of work.  Very disappointing after spending almost 60$ for two bottles that remain full in the back of my cupboard

....comes hefty disappointment. Andis is a good brand of clipper, "however" $80 for this pair of clippers is $70 too much. The power is weak and it takes about 24 hours to fully charge. 

These clippers are not designed for professional use at all. I am not a barber, my wife cuts my hair every 2 weeks or so. It does a decent fade job and my 2 boys(3 and 4) are mixed and seems to cut through their hair with a little more ease than mine. 

However it seems that my past corded clippers had more power which translate to easier cutting and trimming. My wife has to constantly go over various spots multiple times because it did not hit the spot the first or 2nd time.

My recommendation is to do your research and go with another pair of Andis clippers, stay away from this pair, or you'll be finding yourself writing a review saying I agree with the first guy that reviewed this product

I bought this product thinking that it was so pricey it just had to work. Well it doesn't. I followed the directions and went through two bottles with no results what so ever. I'm 24, 23 when I tried the product... no reason it should not have worked if it actually worked at all. If it doesn't work it should get 1 star because it is not delivering on its promise and the promise is why people buy this stuff. I wish I hadn't listened to the raves on this product

I bought the cream hoping to get rid of, or at least lighten stretch marks from pregnancy.  I have used it three times a day for 3 months and have seen no results.  It smells horrible and having to apply 3 times a day is really a pain in the hind parts.  I was very optimistic after reading some of the other reviews.  I'm now very disappointed.  If something sounds too good to be true, it is

I used to love Curious. I asked for it for my birthday and my boyfriend bought me the large bottle with the atomizer and the lotion. However, a few months after I got it, it started to smell funny... over time the atomizer became very hard and had a sticky film all over it. When I opened the bottle I gaged at the stench. I poured it down the sink and it was yellow. I do not recommend buying this product and if you must have this scent please don't buy it with the atomizer. The lotion still smells good.

Like many others, my perfume turned yellow as well. I think it only happens with the atomizer. Perhaps exposure to air SOURED the perfume. I am throwing it away as soon as possible because it no longer smells good. The product was bought for me as a gift and it came in a huge set. I am disappointed and sad that my friend spent about 60 dollars for a cheap product with a short shelf-life. I am never buying perfume from Britney Spears. Obviously the makers of the perfume did not perform enough quality control tests before releasing the perfume.

I immediately fell in love with the fragrance, and my husband bought me the really big bottle.  I wanted to savor it, and make it last.  Much to my dismay it turned an ugly pee yellow and now smells like pure rubbing alcohol.  It also formed a nasty, crusty substance all over the pump and bottle.  I am soooo disappointed!!!

I received my Curious perfume not last christmas, but the christmas before.. and i was SO excited, i had already been through the shops at least 15 times just trying it on over and over, using every tester i could find.
when i got it, i was just as happy and used it just *so* carefully, i wanted it to last for years. 
i got the one that comes with the pump, the largest bottle.... anyway, 
i now look over to my dresser and see it sitting there. YELLOW.
my curious perfume
WENT
YELLOW
and apparently mine was not the only one that went bright yellow, my brothers girlfriends is also a lovely urine coloured yellow. 
it also grew a sticky coat of curious smelling...crud.. around the bottle and just today i went over to it, only to find it LEAKING all over my table... i squeeze the pump and it is rock hard... i look over to the nozzle and it is covered in a thick crust, the whole thing has crusted over and is leaking, i squeezed it again and  my curious perfume  splerted out..
it now smells off
and doesn't really look all that fantastic as you may have guessed.
i am DISGUSTED and so 
so angry
that perfume i wanted so bad and was so excited to get now sits on the table surrounded by it's own disgusting pool of crust and leaking hardened perfume (i didn't even know that was possible) 
i am disgusted
what a cheap nasty NASTY product.
do NOT buy it unless you think you're going to use it within a period of 1 year.

good work!
a product as cheap and nasty as the person endorsing it

When Curious came out, I smelled it and had to buy it. I acknowledged at the time that the bottle was probably half of the reason I bought it (unfortunately). The bottle is beautiful and attracts many customers by itself. The fragrance is very pretty and sweet. It goes on very strong but fades quickly, which it annoying. 
Also, maybe six months after I bought it, I noticed that it started smelling a little different. I left it in my bathroom for a while without moving it because of the difference. Today, I picked the bottle up and the sprayer was covered in this ....disgusting filmy substance, which had also dripped down the sides of the bottle and created a ring of filth on my countertop. It was really really gross. By the looks of it, the perfume had some sort of chemical reaction with the metal from the nozzle of the sprayer. 
Anyways, the whole bottle smells awful now and it's digusting. The bottle design was it's awful putrid demise, which ruined $50. It's really unfortunate too, because I loved the bottle and the fragrance when I got it and now it's junk

I had very high hopes for this cream, as it appears they went the extra mile for quality. Not so. The cream when used leaves alot of friction as the razor goes over your face, making for some tense moments that should not be there.
I have used many creams. So far Art of Shaving is the best. Casswell Massey is ok as is Aveda. Avoid Truefitt

OMG - if you decide to use this use it SPARINGLY!!!!  I can't stress it enough.  I decided to get the Philosophy acne kit because I had a few minor breakouts and clogged pores.  I had been using Clean &amp; Clear salicylic (sp?) acid products with no trouble so figured this wouldn't be much different.  Boy was I wrong!  The first week was great; week #2 the nightmare began... I wound up these huge, brownish-red, sore, swollen, itchy bumps/scabs on my face.  I have since stopped that portion of the treatment and am now moisturizing my face back to health.  Last night my bf said it looks better than the 'pizza face' from the Philosophy products.  Yikes!  Try at your own risk but take it slow

Never had I been so unhappy with my makeup as I was when I was using Clinique. I used Stay Beige (which I lightly patted on my face on top of Clinique's superfit liquid makeup - I have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. I also hated how Clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades, so that I had to settle for Honey in the liquid and Beige in the powder. As much as I went back to Macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades, they just wouldn't listen. Either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade, or they were convinced I was making a big deal out of nothing. Instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which I shouldn't have to do in the first place) I just switched to a different makeup line: Laura Mercier, which I am VERY happy with.

I've had many other friends who were unhappy with Clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand, as well. I'm not trying to knock the product. I'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people I know. I would definitely NOT recommend Clinique to anyone. I'd rather pay a little more and get better results rather than settle for a $20 product just because it's affordable.

I just purchased the small bottle(Thank God) of the Ojon ultra hydrating shampoo and conditioner.  It seems like it made my hair a little softer, but the smell is horrendous.  I have gotten the worst headache from the smell of this product. So overall it may make my hair feel softer, but there is no way I will put this stuff on my head again.  The rest is going in the trash

I do not like this shampoo at all. In fairness, I did give it two stars because it may not be good for coarse african american hair. It seemed to make my hair clump together and made it difficult to comb through when wet. The one thing that did detangle it however was the ojon hydrating conditioner which I do love.  Did have a pleasant scent and foamed up well

I can't believe how much amazon and other retail stores (like sephora)charge for this.  I buy Prevage MD (which is double the strength of regular Prevage) from my plastic surgeon's office and I only pay 120$.  Why would you pay 30 dollars more for something that is only half the strength of the good stuff?  If you don't want to go to the doctor to buy the MD version, then you can get it off ebay for around 100$..

I bought this product in the color Paparazzi from Sephora - online, I read wonderful reviews about it in the magazines.  I was very disappointed when I finally got it and tried it. There is way too much glitter in it for anyone over 13.  I could not wear this to work or even an evening out as I would feel like a clown.  The only place this would look semi-good at would be a nightclub where it is dark. I was hoping for more of a shimmer than pure glitter.  I do not recommend this product at all. I also returned this promptly back to Sephora.

I was looking forward to receiving this body lotion; however was very disappointed when I opened it and smelled the fragrance.

It smells exactly like paint.  Then after a few minutes it seems to just disappear with a faint paint-like scent.

I will not buy any more Philosophy products.  The less expensive fragrances/lotions are so much better that you buy from Target, Wal-Mart, etc

I love falling in love fragrance and the shower gel, but this lotion is not getting as much love from me. It doesn't smell the same to me, and on a bad day, makes me a little sick.  It's sweeter smelling.  Thing is, I need lotion, and I don't want competing scents.  Otherwise, I might have rated it even lower

Actually, I would give the product 5 stars, and the packaging a minus-2. CityLips really does work, plumping and hydrating; it does required repeated applications. BUT the packaging results in about 10-12% of the (expensive) material being completely unavailable!  Worse, if you try to wiggle the (too-short) applicator in order to get the last 10%, the container breaks at the neck (actually, one came already cracked in my case!).  True, they do offer some colors at 2/3 price, but most effective is to apply clear, and go outside the lipline-and the clear almost never has gone on sale!

I used two tubes in one month - one for daytime wear, and one for nighttime and when I wasn't going out (clear).  I like the product: how it looks and smoothes out my lips, but I just cannot afford to pay $60 a month on my lips!  If they lower the price by $10-12, I will buy it again......but not until they do :-

I am SO DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!! I ordered this scent after hearing about it from friends, and reading great reviews.  All of the reviews I read mentioned the lack of staying power that this product has, but I never expected the product to be so extraordinarily weak.  Don't get me wrong, I do not want my fragrance to enter a room before I do (after all, it is not the 80's anymore lol), but I also do not want to have to sniff my wrist so hard to detect the scent that I take off skin!  The scent is beautiful, I would love to wear it!  But 20 minutes after I sprayed it on, I could barely detect the fragrance.  As sometimes it is harder to "smell your own perfume", I asked my hubby and friends for their opinions.  They could barely smell it either.  I would happily wear this scent every day if I could enjoy it at all.  If Philosophy can create this scent with staying power, they will have a customer for life.  As it stands now, I would not recommend anyone buy this product.  It is a very disappointing waste of money

I am such a huge fan of the Philosophy Grace line that I thought I would really love this, too.  I find that it is much too light for me.  It does smell exactly like cotton candy which is nice, but it doesn't last long at all.  I guess I'll have to really spray a lot for anyone to even notice I'm wearing it.  Nobody has said anything so far.  The shower gel is a waste as far as scent goes...wonderful lather, but no smell to speak of.  I will stick with Amazing Grace, Baby Grace and Pure Grace.  Those are wonderful

I bought two Clarisonic brushes - one as a gift and one for myself.  Although the product works well, unfortunately, both brushes were defective.  The trouble started occurring about two months after using.  One brush started out with two speed settings, but eventually only functioned at the low setting.  The other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged!

My experience with the customer service has been terrible.  They would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty.  Be careful if you are going to travel abroad.  The warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v!

This perfume deserves negative stars. I was in Macy's when I saw this fragrance on the Dior counter. The bottle is gorgeous, and I really like Hypnotic Poison and Miss Dior Cherie, so I figured I would give this one a try. I really should have smelled directly from the bottle before spraying it on my skin. It is HORRIBLE. White floral scents are generally not my thing, but I can usually tolerate them. This was the worst perfume I ever smelled. It's way too powdery and it smells so cheap. I was stuck with it on my wrist all day and it kept making me sneeze. Disgusting. Not worth the money at all. If you want to buy this scent, I would recommend buying Dove Deodorant Spray instead. It's much cheaper and smells exactly the same. I wonder if it really is the Dove Deodorant but repackaged...hmm..

At first, it's a beautiful floral scent, then it dries to something that gives me a headache.  I cannot detect what smell it is, but it's not pleasant.  I cannot detect vanilla in this at all.

I was a little afraid to try this after reading some of the reviews, but the list of ingredients sounded wonderful so I gave it a try.  I love it!  It's surprising.  It changes.  On me, when I first put it on it takes on a white floral scent.  When I first applied it, I was surprised that it seemed like a floral".. but hours later I was smelling Vanilla.  I was very surprised to realize it was me!  VERY interesting! Very cool!  Lighter than the Original Poison, it may become my Spring/Summer choice

I loved the smell in the magazines so I decided to get it.  Well...it was good at first...and then I got tired.  It smells a little cheap and sort of like pine.  I sometiems use it, but let me tell you it smells good on your armpits (that's what I use it for).  

I think this smell reminds me of some kind of cologne that has been worn for tooo long

I bought this soap just to see what all the Philosophy hype is all about. I was not impressed. It smells just like ordinary soap-so what? The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it does lather well. You can get soap that smells better at Wal-Mart!

i saw this and bought it from qvc because they raved asbout how it moisturized thick curly/kinky hair. it didn't do anything for my hair and i didn't like the smell (but its not that big of a deal)--i returned it. i don't think its for coarse-kinky curls, but maybe for others textures.  

&amp;lt;for coarse 'naturals' try carol's daughter's healthy hair butter and khoret amen line

     Sorry to say I found this nail polish remover to be extremely drying, something I haven't experienced with other removers.

     In addition, it takes several applications to successfully remove just one coat of polish.  

      On the plus side, it's fragrance free and reasonable in price

I really wanted to like this but I find that my skin looked ashen and orangey after a couple of hours. When I went back to get a lighter color, it did the same. I think there's just too much yellow in this foundation. And considering it's oil-free, it didn't really keep the oils at bay and practically slid off my skin by midday.

I would suggest trying this first and wear it all day to see if it turns orange on you. Or if you're looking for a similar oil-free foundation, I would highly recommend Laura Mercier Oil-Free or Chanel DPF

As much as I LOVE Fat Girl Slim, I thought I'd try Serious Cellulite soap to go with it. I was not impressed at all. It has a terrible medicine like smell that lingers on you and after a few washes there are no more dimples on the soap. It was what I thought it would be at all. The size of the bar was good, the price is good, but I am not pleased at all with the quality

The texture of this cleanser is waxy.  I could barely get it off my face, and I broke out badly after using it.  I double checked the packaging to make sure it really was supposed to be a facial cleanser, and that I hadn't mistakenly put some other product on my face.  It smells wonderful, though.  I tried to think of alternate uses for the product, but finally threw it away

I haven't had an outbreak of acne in about 5 years until I started using this cream. I kept using it thinking that my huge cysts couldn't possibly be from this very pricey stuff. I went to the dermo and she said to stay away from these thick creams specifically for anti-aging because they are horrible for your skin. I went back to my cheap neutrogena lotion for anti- aging and it felt sooo much better and lighter and within a week my skin cleared up. I didn't even realize how very thick this stuff was until I started back on my neutrogena. I feel so bad about the $$$ I lost and I wish I would've gotten a sample first. I encourage you to do the same.

I was very unhappy with this product. First the shipping took way too long. Second, the tube is much smaller than sold at Macy's and the cost is more. And the contents were gross, very goopy. Not smooth. Like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months. I'll fight the mall to buy this next time

My sister-in-law bought this product for me after I had admired the shade (Purr, a light baby pink color) that she was wearing. I have used other MAC products before with great results, but was VERY dissapointed with this product. 

First of all, I gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. However, this product is sticky. VERY sticky! It does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. Not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. When I wear a lip gloss, I want to be soft and smooth feeling. I want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak. 

Also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. This will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. Very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!  

This product seems to be popular with other viewers, however, I would never reccomend this to anyone

I hate to say this since Philosophy is one of my favorite brands, but this is probably the worst mascara I have ever used. It clumps really badly and is very difficult to remove. It does not simply wash off, it forms little rubbery strings that end up all over your face and the bathroom sink. About half of them remain attached to your lashes, and I've pulled so many of mine out just trying to remove the mascara. Everything else I've ever tried from Philosophy was fantastic, but the best mascara out there, hands down, is from Lancome

This clarifying lotion is too harsh. I used it once and my skin is itchy, dry and red. I think I'm allergic to it. Basically, the chemicals in these products are really harmful. Most of the time, people don't need these products. All they do is clog up what nature has given us. This lotion is horrible

I purchased the entire 3-Step Clinique system including: 
Clinique Facial Soap with dish
Clinique Clarifying Lotion 2
Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion


About the same time I started using the Clinique 3-step system, I began wearing foundation for the first time. I found that my skin started breaking out and began to be dry in some spots. I stopped using the foundation after about 3 months because I thought that was the issue. However, my skin problems did not improve and I even moved down a level in the Clinique system to one for more sensitive skin.

However, after about 7 months of daily use, my skin was not improving and I found a review of the Clinique 3-step System from Paula Begoun. Her research indicates that all of Clinique's facial soaps in the 3-Step System are too irritating for all skin types. Her research also stated that all Clarifying Lotions (1-4) contain alcohol and Clarifying Lotion 2 contains menthol which make them too irritating for all skin types. 

I never thought that my skin care products were the cause of my flaky skin and break outs. Apparently, the products dried out my skin making it flaky in some areas and in response, my skin started producing more oil to compensate for the dryness-which made me break out in other areas. I switched to Paula's Choice facial products and I occasionally use Cetaphil. After I made the switch, my skin slowly began recovering. 

Unfortunately, now I have some acne scars on my cheeks as a result of using the Clinique 3-step system. It makes me sad because before, my skin was healthy and for the most part clear. I do want to be fair to Clinique. They have some great products---I use their City Block Sheer SPF 15, Advanced Stop Signs Eye SPF 15 and I wear Clinique Happy perfume which smells amazing. 

I hope this review proves helpful to other women so you don't have to go through what I went through! Clinique does have some great products in their line, but they do need to  reformulate their 3-Step Skin Care System.

I'm sorry but this is one of the worst perfumes.  I seriously can spray myself about 10 times and within 30 minutes you can't smell a thing.  yes the scent is great, I love it.  But the only person who has the opportunity to smell it is me.  Really really disapointed.  I guess I'm just used to the Channel and Ralph Lauren lines.  They are quality and can last most of the day.  This stuff is plan old junk like most of the new stuff coming out these days.

The Key to My Heart lipgloss chain is a very cute, original idea, but it fails to deliver the quality worthy of the Hard Candy name. The reviews here have all stated that this is a cute keychain, that the gloss is nice and that the colors are pretty. All very true. I got my keychain in the Pixie tones and they're girly and pretty and I was feeling pretty cool about it. However, for me, the disenchantment came with the mechanics of it. 

Now, I've always been a fairly careful person, I'm not klutzy nor do I drop or lose things. My keys are as normal as a standard set of keys can be, I never dropped them or banged them against stuff any more that's normal and yet, after less than a week the keychain hinges had broken twice. The first time I was able to make a little mess of superglue and scotch tape and managed to rescue it and put it back into almost normal condition, the second time however, I only noticed that the entire thing had fallen completely apart because I saw only half of the keychain remained and my keys were all covered in pink goo. 

How did it come apart like this? I honestly have no idea as my keys had only made the very normal trajectory between the ignition and my purse. I can honestly only chalk it up to really, really shoddy craftsmanship which may be adequate for a dresser-top lipgloss but never for something that could get even remotely more movement than that. It was a good idea but too low-quality to be fit for the purpose of a keychain. This is not the way to go for gloss on your keys

I love the smell of this perfume. However, it doesn't stay on. I have been wearing perfume for 18 years now and have used several different kinds without a problem. I was sold by SJP on this perfume when she appeared on Oprah. Loved it when I went to the counter at the mall to check it out. I have been using it for about 2 months now and it just doesn't last. About an hour after I put it on I (or my husband) can't smell it anymore. Trust me, I learned to apply it liberally and it still doesn't stay. Totally disappointed

As some people before me said already, this scent isn't THAT lovely. I am a SJP-fan, and I was almost certain I would love the new perfume of this stylish lady.
It isn't released yet in Holland, but I found a sample in Germany where it is already released. I was disappointed. The smell isn't bad, but it's isn't something I would like to smell like. It isn't lovely at all. It is too sporty. I expected something more flowery. The scent reminded me most of deodorant (cheap brands) or toilet-refreshener. So, although I am a SJP-fan, I wouldn't like to smell like her. A pity.
My favourite perfumes are (as a comparison): Beyond Paradise (Estee Lauder), Curious (Britney Spears), Couture! (Moschino), Live (J.Lo), Tumulte (Christian LaCroix), several Escade Limited Edition Perfumes and Gucci Rush 2

After hearing Oprah's rave reviews of this perfume, and seeing that it was one of her Favorite Things for 2005, I thought for sure I'd love it.  I ran right out to the nearest department store for a sample of it!  I just had to see for myself...

Well, I was NOT impressed.  The scent is so strong and overwhelming that it actually seemed to "catch" in my throat.  I accidentally got some on my hand and after four hand washings I could still smell it.  I guess, for those of you who like this perfume, that's probably a good thing.

Anyway, I think this perfume is too "old lady" for my taste.  It reminded me of J. Lo's Glow.  Which I also have and don't like.

For comparisons sake, perfumes I do like are Britney Spears' Curious, Clinique Happy, Escada Island Kiss and Lucky You

I bought this eyeliner expecting great things, and was sorely disappointed.  Application is difficult, mistakes are almost impossible to correct even if done immediately, and I can't soften the line (it *is* smudgeproof).  If you are used to a brush-on-liquid-liner, have a very steady hand, and want a dramatic look, this might work for you.  I prefer a softer line, so this didn't.

Also, it almost completely flaked off over the course of the day.

I'm giving it two stars because it really is smudge-proof, no sliding or transferring.  I didn't have the dark shadows from smudging but I did have flakes, so I'm still not happy with it.

This is definitely not worth the pricetag

My husband was revolted by the smell of this product.  I have bad sinuses, so it didn't bother me.  As far as effectiveness goes, there are no miracle ingredients in this concoction.  I used it everyday, several times a day, and noticed no lasting improvement in the look or feel of the skin on my hands.  At a cost of almost $20 for 8.5oz., I got skunked

Shiseido is known for creating top quality products that do not irritate even the most sensitive of skin. My mother and many of my friends mothers swear by their Benefiance line.  I cannot tell you how disappointed I am in their Pureness line. It is for oily/problem skin.  I have been using this for about 10 days and while it goes on nicely and has this wonderful, light, clean fragrance, it had made my skin even oilier.  I thought my skin just had to get acclimated to a new skincare regimen but this is not the case

I'm a huge fan of the majority of the Philosophy line, along with adoring the Amazing Grace scent!  I thought this scrub would be perfect for the spring into summer period because of the light floral scent.  Boy was I wrong!!  
If you love amazing grace, this smells Nothing like it.  IT smells like plastic flowers.. not appealing at all.  Even my fiance made a comment that the bathroom smelled like melting plastic.  If you want a fantastic exfoliator, try Gingerbread Man or the Margarita scrub.. those are devine!  I think I'll stick to my amazing grace body lotion from now on

This is one of the cutest shower caps I've owned, but it didn't keep my hair dry -- the cap kept sliding up my head.  Sephora's shower cap also did the same thing, but, at least, it only cost $5. So far, I've found the best shower caps are the complimentary ones I receive when I occasionally stay in a hotel.

The Philosophy states on their cosmetic's containers: there is no such thing as unblemished skin. Well, this is for sure true, when you use this Kit Kit. I have pictures to proove, that for more than a month of using Acne Kit Kit not even one acne spot dissapeared. I'm combining it with oxygen peel- this doesn't help either. I was as happy as young horse to have all this products for around $40: night and day cream, facial wash and blemish serum. All they do ( maybe except of the wash) is drying out the skin. Soon I have had to buy super-moisturizing revitalizing night cream and sensitive skin, high spf day cream( my skin started showing dark, sun-exposure spots, altough I WAS USING an spf filter) and finally no acne was or is gone. I dont get it- I was having better results using $0,97 hydrogen peroxide after toner than this hydrogen peroxide- based line of cosmetics. For the same price I could have bought stuff that really works-the one that Vanessa Williams is happy with. I know cause I tried it, didn't make my skin feel like Sahara and will be my next choice. Save your money. P.S. The oxygen peel is O.K. dough

I sprayed a tester sheet at a perfume counter with this scent.  After shopping a bit, I went back and decided to buy it.  It's nice and light, but after wearing it for the first time, I realized it's TOO light.  I couldn't even smell it when I held my wrist to my nose.  The second time, I decided to apply more.  I must've used 6-7 sprays and still, only a lingering aroma.  For the amount you have to use and the faintness of the scent, I wouldn't recommend it

I read the label, and it is not a rare, tropical oil at all, but plain old American palm oil!  False advertising really bothers me.  It did condition my hair well, but I agree that the fragrances (which are added to it, by the way) make the odor very strong and unpleasant.  The price is also very high.  I will not order this again

I bought this stuff from the Shopping Channel, and thought it wasn't bad, until I went to get my hair colored. 
The color didn't take!
My hair is shoulder length, and I only used the Ojon on the bottom 5 or 6 inches, because that's the part that was dry. 
The color only took on the 'new growth', not on the rest of my hair - the hair that I had put the Ojon on! 
The smell of the oil, the shampoo, or the conditioner didn't bother me, but the HAIR SPRAY was disgusting. People remarked that I had overdosed on perfume, so I had to wash it again to get the rotten smell out of my hair.
I definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone who colors their hair.

This is a hit or miss product. I ordered a 5 oz jar and while the smell is nauseating (burnt coffee/caramel/cigarettes), the product did work for a while. My extremely dry, curly hair was soft and shiny but then the product became too heavy for my hair and stopped working. I would save my money and experiment with other oils such as coconut, jojoba, almond, avocado before shampooing or after. I adjusted my hair routine by using a natural shampoo and conditioner and adding jojoba oil to my curl cream and it has never been happier. If you do want to try the product, ask the company to send you samples or find a store that sells them.

Although it is great others love this product, I did not get that same streak of good luck. I had been using Clinique for years, merely because it was affordable and a lot of people I knew used it. However, every time I took pictures I couldn't help but cringe after I saw the way my face looked. I'm a naturally tan person, but when I wore Clinique's foundation (I used Honey 07) it would make my face look extremely pale and ghostly, compared to the rest of my body. It got to the point where I got so upset that I went back to the Clinique counter at Macy's and insisted this just couldn't be the right color for me. They insisted it was the correct color and didn't even bother trying new shades on me, even though I had gone back a couple different times. 

Overall, I was really miserable with this product. As a lady, I want to look my best. I definitely don't want to look like someone who doesn't know how to put her makeup on, but whenever I took pictures and saw the way I looked, I couldn't help but think everyone was thinking that. 

For those of you who may be having my same problem, I recommend switching over to Laura Mercier. I made the switch and it's been the best makeup decision of my life. My face has never looked better

I will admit, I am a sucker for hair products. I have very thick hair, that at times, can be a little wild.  I have used Fekkai products before, and their okay.  Certainly not worth the over inflated price tag.  But I read the reviews for this product and thought it might be the perfect solution for my hair during the winter months.  Wrong answer!  This product is very thick, too thick for me to spread through my hair without putting some work into it.  Conditioners and hair masks should be well, conditioning.  I left this hair mask in the required 20 minutes, and it did nothing.  In fact, I had to go back through my hair with my $6.00 Pantene conditioner just to make my hair manageable.  I also have to wonder what the purpose is of putting pieces of nut shells into a product that is supposed to condition hair?  All those pieces are going to do is rough up your hair cuticle.
Ladies, spend your money on a book that reviews hair products! I did and I've realized that ALL hair products are essentially the same.  Only the name and perfumes change.  Read Paula Begoun's book about hair products

I have dry, fine, easlily tangled color-treated hair and thought this sounded like the answer. I was surprised to read the other comments since, for me, this just plain didn't work. My hair was as dry and frazzled as before I used it. I have better luck with conditioners that don't have to be left on for nearly as long a time. I recently discovered a great conditioner from my hairdresser called Bonacure which works in a few minutes and leaves my hair in great condition, shiny, managable and detangled. And for a mask I tried Keratase and it was fantastic and the consistancy made it easier to use and my hair was silky smooth and stronger. I really thought this would be amazing for any type of damaged hair but it wasn't the right choice for me. Maybe I would have had more luck with Fekkai's glossers

I have been using Frederic Fekkai's glossing cream for a few years now and love it so I thought I would try the luscious curls.  It was very thick, which may be a good thing since there is so little of it, but doesn't spread through hair very well.  It left my hair a little crunchy, and the crunchiness didn't go away for a few hours.  When it did dry, i felt that my curls just kind of hung there, without much body or shine.  I have used Loreal's Professional line prior to this and I will definitely go back to it.  It's cheaper, better quality, and twice the size of luscious curls.

Another disappointed customer. 

I have very thick, coarse, wavy hair and trying to manage it is a nightmare! Before using Fekkai's Luscious Curls lotion, I was using Aveda's Be Curly Lotion and Matrix's Curl.Life contouring creme. Both of the latter products work very well with my hair. I don't like to blow dry my hair (too time-consuming), so I just air dry it. Without blow drying, whether I'm using Aveda or Matrix, the results are great! My hair is smooth, shiny, and less frizzy.

I had never used Fekkai's products before, but decided to give this one a try. Everything Luscious Curl Enhancing Lotion claimed to do, didn't do for my hair. In fact, it actually made my hair worst! It became stiffer, drier looking, frizzier. In addition, my wavy hair, (usually bouncy and alive), became flat and dull. Also, I didn't like the scent of this particular curling lotion. It was very strong smelling and made me nauseous.  

Because of my very poor experience with Fekkai's Luscious Curls lotion, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I think I'll stick to the Aveda and Matrix curling lotions, since they are much more compatible with my hair.

I've been using this product for almost 2 months and I have seen NO difference whatsoever in the appearance of my dark circles.  And yes, it does burn!  The only thing I'm glad about is that I bought it from eBay cheaper than it normally sells elsewhere.  
I've had dark under-eye circles all my life.  I suppose I should just learn to live with them and save my money.  I will not be wasting my money on this product again

I've been using this product for about two weeks now and I haven't seen the slightest change in the dark circles under my eyes. I don't know how long you have to use it before you see a difference, but I don't think it's going to show any change in the dark circles. Personally I think I wasted my money. I don't think theres anything on the market that can help dark circles under the eyes.

I gave it two stars because unlike another anti DHT shampoo I tried, this one didn't strip my hair of all oil in one application and make it frizzy.  That is where my praise stops because it smells medicated and funky.

To the people that make this stuff:  My hairline is starting to recede and the last thing I need is to reek of funky old guy smell at age 40!  I would rather continue losing my hair than smell like the 80 year old guy wearing lime green checkered pants.  What part of this don't you people understand?  If you didn't do market research that aspect of it then it makes me wonder about the research done on whether it even works

I used the entire tube faithfully as a face cream over the course of several months.  While I thought it moisturized fine, I did not notice any change in my lines, tone, texture.  For the money I'd go get several tubes of the Neutrogena anti-aging products - they work better, have a nicer texture and smell MUCH better

I used this product for a couple of months with no visible result. In addition it's quite greasy and since it's not made to be used on the face, we can understand that. But that makes it very hard to use along with sunscreen and whatever makeup one chooses.

But I won't buy this again. It smells good and dipping it into one of the Bare Escentual powders to make a lipstick is neat. But the product doesn't really moisturize my lips and I haven't found a color I like on my lips once I dip this into a Bare Escentuals powder. 

I won't be buying this again, I will probably just try a lip gloss next time

The texture of this product is fine, but not really better than anything you can get at the drugstore, therefore overpriced. 

Now, if the flavor and scent were exceptional it might be worth the high price tag, but it doesn't smell that great. It smells rather like over cooked coffee beans.

The Bare Escentuals Soy Mocha SPF 15 has a much nicer smell and texture, if you're wanting a Bare Escentuals product

My mom had bought their darkest shade and after applying it, it was obvious that she was wearing reddish dark brown eyebrow pencil. It didn't blend in at all, it stood out against her black eyebrow hairs. So I bought her an eyebrow pencil from Yves Saint Laurent in #5. That one is perfect, not too black and not too brown

I'm very disappointed with the results. I am fairly young, 31. I have very fine lines and i thought this would make them disappear. It really didn't do anything to my skin. Plus it is greasy and has an unpleasant smell. I do not recommend this

I have been using this product for about a month and all it's done is given me puffy eyes. There is no proof that this product works at all and the FDA has even written the makers of this product a warning letter to stop making false claims that it helps stretch marks and wrinkles. 

I've used Botox before and believe me, Botox works, this product doesn't, so obviously it's not better than Botox. 

I bet the people who gave it 5 stars either work for the company or are fictional entities created by the Basic Research marketing department so that the product seems better than it actually is

I used the entire tube faithfully as a face cream over the course of several months. While I thought it moisturized fine, I did not notice any change in my lines, tone, texture. For the money I'd go get several tubes of the Neutrogena anti-aging products - they work better, have a nicer texture and smell MUCH better.

As for "better than botox"  - buyer beware when you hear this line

One, I don't think this is better than botox.  Botox works instantly and more dramatically, but it's more expensive.  However, when you think about how much you're spending on this strivectin, applying it every day for the rest of your life, you could get botox (yes, you need to get more botox every several months, but the costs are about the same).  Not only that, but botox simply works better.  However, if you just can't afford botox, then I would buy Rulinea FX which is the exact same ingredients as Strivectin, but half the price, it's available on HSN.co

I'm pretty sad about this one, especially because of the cost.  I'm 34, with decent skin but some of the typical lines starting around the eyes, forehead, lip line, etc.  My skin does tend toward oily yet sensitive at times, if that context helps any of you out.  A friend of mine all of a sudden looks 10 years younger, beautiful, glowing poreless skin without needing any foundation so I asked her what she was using.  This was one of her key products and she said it took about 2 months for the effect to really be noticeable.  

Unfortunately I can't use it enough to find out.  First I tried appplying it around my eyes, on my forehead and above my upper lip.  I broke out in really deep cystic acne in those areas after about 4 days.  I started relegating the application only to the eye area and even that is now having a horrible reaction.  I look like I've got insect bites under my eyes, or like I've been punched out.  Yuck.  It's gotta be some kind of allergic reaction.  It works so beautifully for my friend, I guess I'll be giving it to her to finish

I used Stryvectin religously for two months and one week - more than double the recommended time to get some results - and it has made no more difference to my skin than regular moisturizer. I used it for fine lines on my face and thicker lines on my neck and forehead. To determine if it really worked, I decided to use it experimentally by applying it to the left side of my face only - every day as suggested on the packaging. After all this time, I cannot see the slightest difference between the left side of my face and the right side, and nor can any of my friends. I got better results on my neck when I was using Shiseido neck cream which is a third of the price. I would not buy Stryvectin again

Never had I been so unhappy with my makeup as I was when I was using Clinique. I used Stay Beige (which I lightly patted on my face on top of Clinique's superfit liquid makeup - I have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. I also hated how Clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades, so that I had to settle for Honey in the liquid and Beige in the powder. As much as I went back to Macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades, they just wouldn't listen. Either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade, or they were convinced I was making a big deal out of nothing. Instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which I shouldn't have to do in the first place) I just switched to a different makeup line: Laura Mercier, which I am VERY happy with.

I've had many other friends who were unhappy with Clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand, as well. I'm not trying to knock the product. I'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people I know. I would definitely NOT recommend Clinique to anyone. I'd rather pay a little more and get better results rather than settle for a $20 product just because it's affordable.

I have to be honest.  I bought in to all the hype of mineral make-ups.  My sister uses the bare essentials and her skin looked flawless and she has uneven tones like I do.  I didn't want to pay the price or join the club so I tried Pur MInerals.  I still had to use a "cover-up" under my eyes and blemishes and had to put pur minerals on rather heavy to get the "flawless" look.  But then it looked too powdery.  I started using my regular cover-girl foundation and powder again as I felt it covered better and less heavy.  Just a note, my sister said she still uses a "Cover up stick" when using bare essentials too, but she looked beautiful in it

This product did nothing for my t-zone. I was still very shiney and oily by mid-day. I recommend Benefit's Dr. Feelgood.

I gave this product two stars because though it didn't control oil for me, it didn't feel heavy or clog my pores

This product costs 10 times more then a regular gel.  But it does not even work as well as a regular shaving gel.  Its like putting a thin layer of soap on you face.  It did not help at all. No doubt the people who marked this up one thousand present are the geniuses in the Marketing Department, because, it fooled me just like it fooled everyone; $$$18 FOR A GEL! IT MUST BE more effective, "I'll give it a try". There is a sucker born every day.

I love coconuts, and would love it if this made my hair smell like coconuts.  Instead, my hair smells like burnt coconuts.  Or even burnt newspaper.  The conditioning qualities of the product aren't good enough (and it certainly isn't cheap enough) to make me purchase this again.  At least not until I develop a hankering for smokey-smelling hair

It smells great, like coconut.  I have long curly hair, and it made my hair dry and brittle.  I've noticed this with all of the LUSH conditioners I've tried, so I would not recommend it for naturally curly hair.  2 stars for the great smell

HI
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
There are much better products by LUSH.

I got a free sample of this conditioner and used it along with LUSH's Trichomania solid shampoo.  At first I really liked it, but throughout the day, my hair felt like it was getting oilier.  I'm not sure if it was the Trichomania or the Coolaulin, but I gave both away to my friend who likes coconut.  The smell wasn't my favorite either (I'm not a coconut person), but if you like coconut, you will love the shampoo and the conditioner.

As for me, I will stick to American Cream and Rehab.

**UPDATE**
December 21, 2005
I tried the Coolaulin conditioner again, and my hair didn't get oily at all.  I'm not sure what happened the first time I tried it, but it was fine this time around.  I'm not a coconut person, so this conditioner is still not my fave (American Cream!!), but I do want to add on TWO stars and make the rating *~*FOUR STARS*~* because the conditioner made my hair really soft

I found this product did absolutely NOTHING for me...granted I don't have huge wrinkles, but the few I do have certainly got no better and i'm wondering if it made them worse! I wish I had asked around from friends, cause if I had I would have discovered this on my own without wasting the money. I'm wondering a couple of things, what all the fuss is about with strivectin? Is it just that everyone is different and some people have good results and some don't? AND is there anyone out there who can recommend a product that REALLY works? (if it works i don't mind spending the money...

I usually enjoy products by Philosophy but this stuff is not worth washing the family Xolo with, amigo. Trust me. This stuff STINKS! If a margarita is what you are craving, then stop in at the local Don Pablo's at lunchtime. Not only does this stuff smell bad on the skin, but, as the bottle warns, using this product can cause irritation to the skin and the urinary tract. Not good.

I will say one good thing about this product: it made the drains in my home smell lime-fresh for days after having poured the entire contents down them.

I quickly realized while in the shower that I don't want to smell like a margarita all day.   It does lather well and I don't find the smell to overpowering but it's not that special.   Warning to those of us that chemically treat our hair, this product as a shampoo is very drying and strips color out of hair.

I can't say enough about philosohpy, but I read another review recomending not to get the mimosa scent because it smells like the tang drink, so I purchased the margarita instead.  I hate to say it, but it is probabloy about the same for this product.  It smells so much like kool-aid that I can't use it. The smell is way to sweet.  I am a big margarita fan, but this smells nothing like it!  Just a caution

Any manufacturer that doesn't fully label their product should not be trusted. I do not see a list of ingredients here (but most nail polishes don't bother to do this anyway). The problem I see is this...this nail polish totes that it's safe to use during pregnancy due to the fact that it doesn't contain the above ingredients, but what DOES it contain instead? If it wears well, doesn't peel, give good color coverage, it's got to contain something in the offending ingredient's place, logically. 

Please ask yourself this before you sigh relief and Add to Basket! Phthalates, for example, are a class of industrial plasticizers that were invented in the 1930s. They are often used in nail polish because they make nail polish flexible, and they are used in other products because they help bleed the chemicals of fragrances and help lotion better penetrate the skin. They aren't required to be labeled on the products. Lab animals given dibutyl phthalate had higher numbers of offspring with birth defects, especially of the male reproductive system. A nail polish may not contain phthalates (and brag about it), but may contain a related plasticizer that essentially is just as harmful. Does this contain phthalic anhydride, a toxic chemical hardener? How about FD&amp;C color, such as Yellow 5? It's a petroleum-based color that is also questionable when it comes to safety. 

Basically put, no nail polish is safe during pregnancy. On top of that, while your at it you should review every lotion, foundation product, etc that you use if you're concerned about things like this. I think it's great to be careful - more power to you - but be fully informed, not partially. Companies prey on our worst fears, and what is worse than harming our babies? If this product is so great, let's see an ingredients list (and all cosmetics should do the same, while I'm sounding off on the subject!)

I have to be pretty honest - I was excited to get this kit, but so far I've been disappointed.  Maybe I'm not getting the whole technique down, but I find the diagrams pretty generalized and the powder flakes everywhere it isn't supposed to (like under my eyes, making them look very raccoon-y and tired--and when wearing smoky eyes, I figure you probably want everything else to look pretty bright in comparison to the dramatic eye effect).  Maybe I can't pull of the look or maybe I'm not applying it correctly, but either way, it always ends up looking like a big, dark, glittery mess...I'm a big Bare Escentuals lover, but I was disappointed with this product.

Didn't like this product. All of the actual "scrub" (salt) is at the top and minimal.  Felt like I would've been better off mixing some olive oil and actual sea salt to give myself a good scrub.  It did smell nice and I like the packaging

I enjoyed using this product because I liked the tingling from the mint - not necessarily a good thing, actually rather meaningless to the appearance and cleanliness of my face.  The Kaolin and Bentonite are drying agents, peppermint is harsh on sensitive skin.  If you separate out the so-called natural ingredients, you are left with the same basic stuff that any other cosmetics company uses.  And if it doesn't come straight out of the ground, it ain't natural anymore!  I give it a 2 because I was a sucker for the tingling, not because I saw any improvement in my skin's texture, look, or feel

Well i dint like the smell at all, i see nothing lovely about this perfum, if ur looking for a good perfume to give this holiday season, check out Fantasy by Britney Spears it smells so nice, or Curious by Britney thats a classic its a must give or have, J.Lo's Live smells really nice too so if i was you i would rather not buy it if ur giving it as a present,or for urself its not really worth ur money!

I have oily &amp; blemish prone skin and I was told by my Mother, who used to work for the Clinique/Estee Lauder family, to give their products a try because they are supposed to be non-cosmogenic. This product irritated my skin so much that I just had to rinse it off to relieve the itchiness. The only reason why I used it more than once was because it was supposed to leave behind a tingling sensation to show if it was working. If it was working, it hurt like hell and it made my face break out with more acne than I ever had all at once. Not worth your money

I love trying out new products for my hair and also happen to have slightly thinning hair on the top of my head (with receding corners).  After seeing this set at Sephora I tried it for a week and found the results mediocre. 

My hair, which is thin and not very abundant, did feel slightly thicker and had a plump look at the roots (especially the crown) but I am sensitive to smell and didn't like the man's cologne like scent.  The shampoo lathers up nicely but the conditioner is dense and doesn't spread well over the hair.  The mouse is interesting.  It definitely seems to make a difference in volume.  The overnight liquid makes hair a bit messy to sleep in.  

As is the case with any product, it may work for you but it didn't for me.  I believe in changing the body/hair from the inside out works better than rubbing niacin (vitamin b) topically to the scalp and hair.

I would recommend you try it.  You can always return it if you're not satisfied

I love Clinique products in general, but I don't like the soap in the liquid form ... it has a strong chemical smell to it and I find myself holding my breath while washing my face.  I much prefer the bar soap, and wouldn't buy the liquid again, for all that it seemed much more convenient.  No complaints on cleaning-ability

This product might be better on oily skin with no make-up. The point of it was lost on me. It may create a barrier between treatment products/moisturizer and make-up but it did nothing to perfect my skin. In fact when I touched my face I could feel make-up pilling and rolling off. It has a dry, heavy feeling to it. Don't use too much and be careful about dry patches. I thought it would make a better canvas of my skin. I now use Laura Mercier's primer which goes on light and smooth and gives a healthy glow. I didn't like the formulation of Philosophy's product at all

I normally like warm, sensual-type perfumes, but I wanted to try something different for a change.  I liked the fact that this is advertised as subtle and not perfumey.  Well...I have to disagree.  I think it is VERY perfumey and not subtle at all. To me it has a very sharp, high-toned scent which is almost acrid. I thought at first that maybe I had sprayed too much on, so I tried just a little spritz.  Still VERY strong and sharp. And I agree with the comparison to dead flowers and dryer sheets.  I will definitely not be ordering this again.

I know this is Philosophy's big seller, but I hate the way it smells.  It reminds me of those old ladies that bathe in their fragrance and make everyone around them nauseous.  My husband hated it too, as did my son.

I like the comments about it smelling like dead flowers and a dryer sheet.  That is about as close as it gets.

If you want a good Philosophy scent, go with Falling In Love, Pure Grace or Philosophy - the scent.  All of them are better than Amazing Grace.

I don't care to smell like a perfumy granny, thank you.  I'll stick with my Falling In Love

I love chocolate
I love dark chocolate, especially for my drinking chocolate.
I should have been suspicious when on the label it says you can make pudding from this as well...which should have alerted me right off the bat that there are other ingredients in the tin--not just chocolate and some sugar...it must be cornstarch.

Marie Belle makes a big deal of the fact that this is NOT cocoa, but cacao...that's why I fell for the hype...but in the end, it's the flavor that counts, and this one...I guess because of the corn starch...has a strange "mouth feel" and flavor that I find unpleasant.

I find the French brand  L'Ancienne  far superior...and my favorite drinking chocolate is 
Charbonnell et Walker, which is not for sale (yet) on Amazon

I'm going to Europe and thought this would save me time in the mornings (and maybe nerves, since I'm traveling with two women and no doubt towels will be in short supply!). But this thing is hard to use, the instructions are poorly drawn, and apparently I have the head of a giant - the button and the button latch (which isn't easy to find and isn't identified in the directions) don't stay together due to my ginormous noggin. The reason I chose this specific product to try was because it was pink and would be clearly different from regular hotel towels and because of the cute tube case - I thought it would pack easily. The material itself seems to work (she says as it slides, yet again, down her forehead to cover her eyes). After twenty minutes of wrestling with this cuddly little critter, I concede. Similar items may work, just not this one

I read many positive reviews on Pure Grace and decided to try it since I love a fresh, clean scent.  I was very disapointed when I used it, as it reminded me of Jean nate, which to me is an old lady smell.  It was more musky than clean smelling.  I couldn't smell any hint of feminine sweetness or floweriness to it.  It smelled like scented musky water with a sesemee oil...that is the only way I can describe it

I am dissatisfied with Lush's claims that many of its products, like this one, are natural.  I encourage buyers who are looking for products made with natural ingredients to carefully read the ingredients in Lush's products.  I have yet to see a Lush product that does not contain chemicals of questionable safety.  There are numerous other brands of truly all-natural soaps and shampoos that work excellently

As a huge fan of Pink Sugar and an avid chocolate fanatic, I was ecstatic to try out Chocolovers.  Since they don't sell Chocolovers anywhere near where I live I decided to order it from Sephora.com in the US.  First of all I thought the price was fairly reasonable for 1.7oz bottle (a very nice bottle and package, if I might add), it cost me around $50 CDN.  I was so excited when my order came in today that I quickly opened up the bottle and gave it a sniff.  Ahhh the sickeningly sweet smell of disappointment.  I don't know what I had been expecting, maybe something more like milk chocolate, but what I got was a strong citrus/cocoa powder burst fading into a VERY strong and sweet smell almost like turkish delights or raspberries and chocolate with a hint of musk.  This may sound good, but for as much of a fan of sweet candy/foody smells as I am, I found this one too overpowering and it seriously made me sick.  Right now all I can smell is a sickly sweetness and the smell of flat Seven Up.  On the plus side it has stopped completely my cravings for sweets.  I think if I were trying to diet I would wear this scent everyday.  I think I will keep it in the hopes that it will grow on me because I really love the look of the bottle and the box it came in.  I am also going to try and layer it with a cocoa body lotion in hopes that it will tame down some of the sweetness.  The bottom line is try before you buy

I've had this dryer for almost a year now, and like the styists who also own it, I find it temperamental. It does a great job while it's working, but the thermostat gets progressively buggier after about three months. If you turn the dryer off, you'll have to wait for it to cool completely before it will turn back on. Now, it turns off while I'm in the middle of doing my hair. The stylists have three or four of these so they can alternate working with one while the other(s) cool off - as I said, when they work, they're terrific. I'm going to replace mine with another brand

If you order this kit, make sure you have time to practice with it!  It takes several practice applications to get the shade just right.  While it does cover completely, it is not flawless. You can tell that you've covered something up on your skin.  If it's not a big deal, you might just want to leave your tattoo visible instead of having a big discolored spot or have someone who is really good with colors and makeup cover it for you with this kit

I love Philosophy products and own much of the skin care line.  I consider Purity facial cleanser a must have.  I was excited to try the hair care line and was so disappointed after using it.  I thought maybe I should give it a good shot and use it a few times to see if it got better with repeated use.  It doesn't.  It is among the worst shampoos I have ever tried.  It's almost worse than the cheapy store bought brands that you use in dire straits.  It instantly left my hair hard and brittle feeling and I couldn't wait to slather the conditioner on.  Even after condiditioning, my hair was lifeless and tangled easily!    The poor quality of this product actually made me doubt the entire Philsophy line

I bought two Clarisonic brushes - one as a gift and one for myself.  Although the product works well, unfortunately, both brushes were defective.  The trouble started occurring about two months after using.  One brush started out with two speed settings, but eventually only functioned at the low setting.  The other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged!

My experience with the customer service has been terrible.  They would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty.  Be careful if you are going to travel abroad.  The warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v!

After having great success with the Merkur Classic I decided to own up and get the Futur.  I was super excited because I thought to myself, "shoot, one pass instead of two..."  Not quite.  For starters the razor is bulking and plain heavy.  And not the kind of heavy I'm comfortable with trying to shave as I shouldn't feel I might drop the darn thing.  I started on 1 the first day to get a handle on the razor.  Not a good shave, missed alot of spots and patches of hair.  So day two I went to level 2 on the razor.  Same story, second verse.  It left patches and didn't shave well in some areas.  2.5 the areas got smaller but still...they were there.  Went to a 3 setting on the razor and almost mangled myself.  So for the next week I went back to a 2.5 and did it more consistantly, still gave me a crappy shave.  I give this one star because if it's supposed to be a better razor than anything before it, there shouldn't be a learning curve from one double edge to another.  At least not one this severe.  I get a way better shave using my merkur classic and I really think at least for me, this is the way to go.  I say use caution on the Merkur Futur.  I also say if you're already getting a good shave with a double edge you have, don't buy a new style for the sake of buying a new style.  If you're double edge gets old...buy a new one of the same kind.  Only a suggestion.

I ordered this for fun and have since decided that it's definitely not for me in any way. It's very drying on my skin, even though it's thick and creamy. The label says it's award-winning, but doesn't state what award it's received (if any!). I fail to see what might warrant it being award-winning. The scent smells like plastic or cheap strawberry candy. Also, it's absurdly priced given the quality. I've tried a few Philosophy items and need to just stop buying them because I'm always disappointed.

I'm with everyone else when they say they were diappointed by this product. I opened this bottle, expecting a totally yummy scent but what I got was nothing like what I expected! When I read that it smelled the Nesquick, I thought I'd like it anyway, because I love Strawberry Nesquick. But this stuff smells like...well, I can't describe it. All I know is I wish I hadn't paid $16 for it. Live and learn, I guess
Perhaps the Strawberry Ice Cream 3-in-1 gel smells better. Off topic, why do they have a Strawberry Milk Shake 3-in-1 gel And a Strawberry Ice Cream 3-in-1 gel? Wouldn't they smell just the same

My experience with this brush has been terrible.  Well, the first two or three days were wonderful.  By the third day, the brush was shedding bristles like mad into my razor.  By the second week, the wooden handle (which does look durable) cracked and the plastic sleeve that holds the bristles popped out--never to go back in again.   I am replacing this brush, sadly, after about 15 uses, and I will be purchasing a more expensive brush, I hope with better results.
***Update, a few months later:  I didn't replace the brush.  I super-glued the bristle-sleeve back into the wooden handle.  It eventually stopped shedding bristles, and I have used it successfully since then.  The wooden handle still looks like it will deteriorate quickly as the finish continues to chip off.  Still not recommended, since I don't think I should have to repair a product within the first few weeks of use

I purchased this shampoo for my daughter after she read rave reviews in a teen magazine.  She has thick, blonde hair and it was dry from summer heat, pool water, and light styling.  After trying the rehab shampoo, she was so disappointed that it did nothing to help her hair.  She said that while it lathered nicely, it felt like it stripped her hair and when it rinsed out, it left her hair overly 'squeeky' and tangled.  The end result once her hair was dried (after using conditioner, too), was that it was a lighter shade of blonde, very fly-away, and dry feeling.  She was hoping for smoother, easier to manage hair.  We debated purchasing this shampoo because of its high cost, and I have to say we are extremely disappointed.  The claims were hype, and the results were not delivered.  Her hair was by no means 'fried' or severely damaged, so I fully expected her to have some more manageable locks after using the product, based on its claims.  I will say that I bought her a shampoo and condition at the drug store that has helped dramatically.  It is Thermasilk Smooth &amp; Silky line, and it works wonders over Rehab for a fraction of the cost.  Save your money on this one

It was hard to apply (I accidentaly sprayed it in my hair and in the air) and what I did manage to get on my face, it did not cover much.  For the price they wanted this is unexcusable.  I promptly returned my Airflash and got my money back.  I do not recommend this product.

I have noticable undereye cirlces and bought this product in the hopes it you lighten them a bit.  I use this product in the mornings and evenings for several weeks. Nothing changed.  I figured maybe it would take more then a few weeks to notice anything so I continued to use this product (use the entire jar, just to give it plenty of time), still not difference could be seen. For me it was a waste of money.

I had one stubborn blackhead at the corner of my lip that compelled me to order this. It did work remarkably well on that blackhead, but then I couldn't leave well enough alone. I must have messed up my pores, because now for the first time IN MY LIFE (I'm 29), I have acne on my chin. The chin is the only place I used this tool (other than that initial blackhead) and now it's one problem after another. Not just whiteheads either, cysts that are inflammed and itchy! The only thing that I've done differently with my skin routine is use this, and it's caused me nothing but problems. Leave the pore unclogging to a professional; you're opening up quite a can of worms if you take this upon yourself.

One of my former roommates used to have Kerastase Nutritive Shampoo for very dry hair.  I remember it smelling great and being endorsed by celebrities as the "it" shampoo for treating dry, unruly tresses. The other day, I saw this shampoo on the clearance shelf at Meijers and regrettably made an impulse purchase.  Even at clearance price, this shampoo was still expensive. 

I have very thick, wavy, and somewhat dry hair that needs lots of conditioning products--when I checked out the ingredients (after I bought the shampoo), I groaned inwardly. Almost all of the ingredients (with the exception of water) is on the Aubrey Organics' "ingredients to be avoided" list (that is, they are considered toxic).  Like Aubrey Organics, other reputable natural beauty manufacturers suggest avoiding parabens as preservatives because they are mildly estrogenic and can be absorbed through the skin. This shampoo has six different types of parabens--methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc.     

If a product has such a steep asking price, then you would think that its manufacturers would put forth a better formula, incorporating non-toxic, natural ingredients (like Aveda, Biolage, and Biosilk).  At least Suave and V05 (bargain-priced shampoos) can boast about having vitamins and silk amino acids in their formulas (though many of their other ingredients are also found on the "to be avoided" list).

I received this free from Sephora as a birthday present because I signed up as a Beauty Insider.  I gave it to my neice for her 7th birthday and she likes it, but there's no reason this product should cost $16.  I'm betting the ingredients, packaging &amp; shipping costs don't total more than $3.  I wouldn't buy it.

I bought this and shortly after I started using it the sides of my noise started swelling up and peeling. I didn't know what was going on and I stopped using it and it immediately went away.. as soon as I started wearing it again the swelling and pain came back.
I am a person who doesn't break out very often and I can tolerate many products.
I now have a permanent red mark on the right side of my nose and it hasn't faded yet. I tried to take it back to nordstrom and they wouldn't exchange it.
This product sucks and as it was the only one I was using I know thats what caused the swelling.

My fiance' left this bottle of Prada on top of her jewelry box and the next time she went to use it, IT WAS EMPTY !!!  Seems the perfume was siphoned up and into the atomizer (pump sprayer) and then it ALL LEAKED OUT and down the bottle "glueing" itself to the jewelry box.  Now we have an EMPTY BOTTLE OF PRADA and A RUINED FINISH on the top of the jewelry box. I have sent Sephora an email explaining what had happened, but have not heard back from them. Beware of where you keep this bottle !!!

This is, hands down, the worst perfume I have ever smelled. If you're in the mood to smell sexy, don't wear this. If you're in the mood to smell girlish, don't wear this. If you're in the mood to smell classy, don't wear this. In other words, I have no idea what kind of mood you have to be in to actually want to wear this. I literally went around work asking twenty coworkers what they thought, and they all agreed this was awful. The only person I can imagine wearing this is a senior citizen. It just smells terrible and drab.. and it wasn't that I got a bad bottle either, I've smelled it in stores and it's the same. Truly terrible

I bought the ultra hydrating shampoo, conditioner, and the treatment, oh and also the hairspray.  These products dried my hair out horribly and weighed it down.  I gave it 2 weeks because it was so expensive and after two weeks my hair never has looked any worse!  I have naturally wavy, thick coarse hair and this made my hair unmanageable - like a helmet head.  My hair had no movement, no shine--just made it very heavy and weighed down.  Last night I used a hair purifier shampoo that gets gunk, minerals, etc out of your hair and after that I deep conditioned it with Kerestase Masintense - wow, what a difference!!  Afer blowdrying my hair it was soft, shiny and had so much bounce!  I woke up this morning and my hair was still awesome.  So glad to have my old hair back - I was beginning to think I had a hormone problem or water problem but it was this Ojon product - horrible if you have the type of hair I have.  Good Luck

This stuff is the worst smelling conditioner I ever encountered.  The perfume penetrated my hair and has not been able to get removed.  It took 2 days before the scent calmed down enough that it was not bothering me with its obnoxiousness.  I wish I could give it a negative rating.  I am glad all I used was a sample and did not pay money to make my hair stink

Might be a great product.  I can't be sure.  Because, uh...hello?...mine didn't come with any instructions whatsover.

I opened it up and I was like, "ah...hello?  Where are the instructions?"  But the Tweezerman Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze did not answer my questions.

If anyone knows how to operate it or would consider selling their instructions, I would greatly appreciate it.  Until then my Tweezerman Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze is just gonna sit there, not being used, like my box of floss, a bag of onions, and my heart.

If philosophy makes it for my skin, I think I own it.  I love the microdelivery peel kit which came with 30 of these pads when I bought the set.  The micro-peel is awesome, but these pads were disappointing.  They dried out in their container and they did not keep up the condition of my skin between peels which is how it was marketed in that kit.  I have seen no difference since I discontinued using this product.  Seems like it could be much less diluted or could be offered in multiple strengths

My experience: I heard such great things about Prevage - restores youthful skin, reverses damage, etc., I couldn't wait until it was available. Finally, I was able to buy it - nice packaging, great dispenser of just the right amount. After two months, I found it to be only a great under makeup moisterizer, and there are plenty of others of equal efficacy for 1/10 the price - Eucerin, for instance.  Kinerase did nothing for me either, so it may just be me - just fyi - fair, sensitive dry skin, middle aged.

I couldn't wait to open my new Ultimate Concealer when it arrived. I thought I was getting the purest and most beneficial makeup on the market. But as I read the ingredient list, my heart fell. 

This is a complete list of the ingredients:
Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Octyldodecanol, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Jojoba Esters, Polyethylene, Stearalkonium Hectorite, Propylene Carbonate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Allantoin, Propylparaben, Dimethicone

May Contain:
Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxides, CI 77499, Mica

This list was taken directly off of the package. Obviously there are many more ingredients than what is listed officially on this page or on Youngblood's website. Make your own decision about whether or not you are comfortable putting some of these ingredients on your face every day

I use the Philosophy 3-in-1 WITH CONDITIONER. It works great and keeps my hair luscious. The one time I accidentally bought a 3-in-1 that didn't have conditioner in it, my hair dried out after two washes and got horrible split ends. After only three applications I had to throw the bottle out. I lost more than an inch off the bottom of my hair. I don't understand how their products can vary so widely in quality, but they do.

This is one of their better scents, however.  I would recommend using this as a body wash only

I ordered this product for my wife 3 weeks before Christmas with several other Philosophy items.  They shipped, this was backordered.  I've sent three messages to them, and have not heard a sinlge response.  Terrible.  Aparently customer services is not a "Philosophy" this company subscribes to.  I have gone ahead and filed a formal complaint through Amazon.  You are probably better off buying their products at a brick and mortar store.  Their online presence is unreliable at best.

These are very well made shears - but they arrived dull, and were unable to cut hair.  After an additional 6$ sharpening they do work fine

I love the Cinnamon Buns shower gel, so I thought I would try the lip gloss. For one thing, it smells/tastes nothing like Cinnamon buns. I don't know what the flavor is, but I don't like it. Maybe they have added almond or something. Secondly, it's way too sticky. My hair kept getting stuck to my lips. It reminds me of vaseline. Since I got this product in a kit, I cannot return it, but I will not be using it again

I bought this item because I heard it was waterproof and I was looking for something to wear swimming. I'm really not impressed. The one thing I will say for it is that the color blended well with my skin. In the bottle it looked like it would be way too dark, so I was surprised by that. It looks like there might be a little wiggle room as far as choosing the correct shade with this one. The coverage is not very good, though. You can put a little extra on without it looking cakey, but it doesn't cover as well as say Lancome's Photogenic foundation. I also highly doubt that it is waterproof. Water-resistant, maybe. Defintely not waterproof. It rubbed off pretty easily with a dry kleenex and even more came off with a wet one. When I tried CoverBlend's water resistant makeup I had to use soap to get it off. The coverage was also much better. Unfortunately they don't offer many shades in the Leg &amp; Body Makeup. I also found that the dew finish did not work for my skin. I have combination skin and tend to have a shiny t-zone. This foundation left me with a shiny nose and forehead. It also made the rest of my face feel slightly oily, which it normally does not. Overall I would say this foundation is a very poor value and I will defintely be returning it to Sephora. At least Sephora has free returns. :

This did nothing for my lashes, which are blonde, but long, so it doesn't take all that much.  It somehow made them look skimpy and clumpy too.  I discovered Diorshow after this and it's phenominal!   But if you want a very good mascara and don't want to spend the money, I recommend Max Factor 2000 calorie.

I bought this mascara based on a review I read on Amazon. Maybe it's just me, but I still find that my lashes "clump" or stick together with this product. It might be the Navy color. I don't think its worth the extra cost - I do just as well with drugstore mascara

I have been on a search for the perfect mascara for many years now, just as many of the reviewers had been.  I purchased this mascara based on the reviews and I am more than disappointed in the mascara.  I would not give you 2 cents for the product and would love to return it.  The mascara is clumpy and will not stick to the eyelash.  I do not mind paying $25.00 for a tube of mascara if it doe's the job, this one doe's not.  I had better luck with Max Factor, Clinque, etc.

For me, it barely looked like I had mascara on at all.  I have blonde eyelashes, so even adding color usually makes my eyes pop, and this didn't really.  I ended up giving it to my mom, thinking that maybe it was just me since so many others loved it, and she didn't like it either.  It ended up in the garbage.  I've loved Dior Show mascara and of course, Great Lash.  I'd recommend those over this, especially for the money

The smell is gorgeous; it really lives up to its name "Happy" -- (being just lightly musk-touched with citrus overtones - it's a great scent for day or night), BUT -- and this is a big BUT, like real happiness, it is very elusive.  As a scent on the skin, it completely fades away after 10 minutes!  For example, today I sprayed it quite liberally and now can't smell it at all, even if I put my nose to my wrist; I swear, it is completely gone.  Very disappointed, and thus cannot recommend it.  5 stars for the scent but minus 4 stars for the staying power = 1 star.

Even the lightest perfumes should have staying power, or else what's the point of wearing them?

The eyeshadow isn't bad, nice color, but the packaging was a disappointment. The brush sits down the center of the encased loose powder and you can't get very much onto the brush. There is no way to open the casing either, so its pretty useless. I found the powder to be an odd texture for a loose eyeshadow also.

I got talked into buying this at the Fresh boutique in Las Vegas.  First, it's very expensive - $38, forgivable if it were outstanding.  It's not even good.  The wand isn't well made, and the product does clump on it, and then it clumps eyelashes rather than lengthen them.  I have tried all week to make this purchase work out for the best, but to no avail.  The worst part is, at the end of the day if I happen to rub my eyes, it smears - racoon eyes.  I've been using Physicians formula and Revlon with the primer both are exponentially better, and I could have purchased eight of them for the cost of Supernova.  On the positive side, it washes off easily and completely with soap and water.

My sister-in-law bought this product for me after I had admired the shade (Purr, a light baby pink color) that she was wearing. I have used other MAC products before with great results, but was VERY dissapointed with this product. 

First of all, I gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. However, this product is sticky. VERY sticky! It does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. Not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. When I wear a lip gloss, I want to be soft and smooth feeling. I want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak. 

Also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. This will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. Very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!  

This product seems to be popular with other viewers, however, I would never reccomend this to anyone

I usually love the Philosophy brand bath and shower gels, but this was a major disappointment-didn't smell anything like pound cake or lavender for that matter-in fact the odor is quite strong and nauseating. There are other gels that are great but AVOID this one! Phew!!

The company/shipping was fine.  No beefs there.  The product itself I find to be rather damaging to the skin.  In order to extract, you have to press down EXTREMLY hard, (If you can even locate what your attempting to extract w/that darn pin hole at the end.)  I can't imagine this wouldn't leave scars.  I wouldn't reccomend this product. I just put it in the drawer, never to be used again.  :

So, I've owned a tweezerman extractor before, and I am now questioning why I didnt go with my instinct and just stick with the familiar...This extractor is no help what so ever. the loop hole is entirely too small and it would be by complete and utter chance that I would press the right pore. its just too small to even target. the lance is helpful for blackheads but it is really sharp and if youre not careful, you could damage your skin. i would recommend not buying this extractor. i would much rather have preferred to sticking with the tweezerman..

The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of one is because I love Benefit. That being said, this perfume is what we like to call a sleeper. It's so faint that you can hardly smell it, but when you do, it's not pleasing at all and you immediately scramble for something that smells better. If you are looking for a young, fun perfume, stay away from this one. It smells old and drab, like your grandmother's china cabinet or an antique store. But if you like that..

I found StriVectin-SD Eye Cream to be a nicely textured cream, but it was too heavy for my skin. This is rather strange, as I have dryish skin around my eyes and like a heavier eye cream. This one clogged up my orbital area so much that I got millia (which I never suffered from before). 

The cream does not absorb very well, but feels good to touch. 

In terms of wrinkles, I had 0 effect. I in my late 20's and am strating to notice the first crow's feet. StriVectin-SD did nothing to alleviate them. 

I have to express an opinion on the price though. If you do like the product and it works for you, price should not be an issue, as the tube lasts forever. I have used it for 6 months easily and am now getting concerned that eye products should be thrown away after such long time. Yet it hasn't run out yet. 

I give it 2 out ot 5 - for the nice texture. And an impressive  advertising campaign that convinced me to try it!

I wouldn't call these a regrettable purchase...I guess I was just a little mislead about how these thing worked.  It doesn't explain that on the packaging. 

I couldn't figure out why the box was so heavy.  They are just socks, right?  Right??  Well, they aren't.  The insides are coated with some sort of heavy-duty silicone.  This makes your feet sweat when you put them on.  I mean, they really sweat.  When you wake up, you're feet have sweat so much that any outer layer of skin cells you have sloughed off.  Hence the soft feet.  And very warm feet.  They'll be good for winter.

The reason why you're only supposed to wear these once a week is because I bet you'll get a really alarming fungus if you do it more.  I tried them two nights in a row once and day 3 greeted me with an intense athletes-foot-like itch.  Not fun.  

The other gripe I have is that they don't come with washing instructions.  Great.  These socks have one purpose in life, and that is to make your feet sweat and then refuse to be washed.  I found that handwashing them in the sink with some handsoap works fine.  For now, anyway.  I don't think they belong in the washing machine.  A laundry horror story is likely to ensue.

Never had I been so unhappy with my makeup as I was when I was using Clinique. I used Stay Beige (which I lightly patted on my face on top of Clinique's superfit liquid makeup - I have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. I also hated how Clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades, so that I had to settle for Honey in the liquid and Beige in the powder. As much as I went back to Macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades, they just wouldn't listen. Either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade, or they were convinced I was making a big deal out of nothing. Instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which I shouldn't have to do in the first place) I just switched to a different makeup line: Laura Mercier, which I am VERY happy with.

I've had many other friends who were unhappy with Clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand, as well. I'm not trying to knock the product. I'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people I know. I would definitely NOT recommend Clinique to anyone. I'd rather pay a little more and get better results rather than settle for a $20 product just because it's affordable.

I bought this with a kit. This stuff was just not worth it to me. But unlike the others I cannot stand the smell. It is very strong and gave me a headache so I could not really leave it on that long. My scalp did feel conditioned though. But if you are sensitive to strong smells be aware that this stuff may bother you.

What's the point of this mascara when half the container doesn't do what it's supposed to do? The black mascara is not good quality--it comes off very quickly. Part of the problem may be that the brush is simply too tiny--larger brushes are far superior when it comes to applying mascara. And the silver stuff--the only reason someone would seek out this product--is all but invisible on the lashes regardless of how many times you go over your lashes with the wand.

My sister-in-law bought this product for me after I had admired the shade (Purr, a light baby pink color) that she was wearing. I have used other MAC products before with great results, but was VERY dissapointed with this product. 

First of all, I gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. However, this product is sticky. VERY sticky! It does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. Not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. When I wear a lip gloss, I want to be soft and smooth feeling. I want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak. 

Also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. This will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. Very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!  

This product seems to be popular with other viewers, however, I would never reccomend this to anyone

Not what I expected! This shampoo soap ruined the texture of my hair. It has no conditioning whatsoever. I used the Jungle conditioner after the shampoo. It is equally hopeless! It is like the clothes washing soap you get in the villages of India! A waste of money, a lot of false advertising and a lot of hype.

Clinique's Exfoliating Scrub is a facial scrub for oily skin. It is a thick, white paste packed with medium-size scrubbing grains -more grains than in Clinique's "7 Day Scrub" for normal skin. To use, massage onto clean, wet skin in a circular motion. Rinse with warm water. Careful not to get it in your eyes, as I did once while rinsing it off in the shower. This scrub does an adequate job of exfoliating and retexturizing skin. But it's unsuitable for sensitive skin, and it stinks to high heaven. It contains menthol, which burns skin and clears the sinuses at no extra charge. Having so much menthol so close to my nose is not a good thing. Of course, it is "100% Fragrance Free" according to Clinique, meaning that the smell of menthol is unadulterated by perfumes. The scrub also contains salicylic acid, so beware that this might be too drying for some skin types, especially if used frequently. The performance isn't bad. The olfactory aesthetics are atrocious. This is the harshest, most caustic facial scrub I've ever used. Sensitive complexions beware

I love Clinique products and have used them for more than 20 years. The Exfoliating Scrub is convenient because it comes in a tube and rinses off easily. (though you only get 3.4 oz., and must use quite a bit of it to see good results). However, it does not work as well as the original "Seven Day Scrub". The original product while greasy and a bit of a pain to use, exfoliates almost as well as professional microdermabrasion and does not irritate - even with daily use. A few years ago I spent the summer neglecting to use my sun block. Needless to say, my skin became a mess (dull, blotchy, discolorations, rough, flaky, etc.). I began my basic Clinique regimen (Mild Facial Soap, Clarifying lotion #2, Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion, and the Seven Day Srub). In less than two weeks I saw a huge difference, my skin was back to normal. I had tried the Exfoliating Scrub later, since I hated to deal with the original "seven day" but soon went back to it as it truly works best. Now I always wear an SPF 45 on my face and stick with my Seven Day Scrub.

It is true that this product smells absolutely awful after it is applied to the face. Worse, it does absolutely nothing. I have been applying a significant amount morning and night, for 6 weeks, allowing it to soak in and dry... It does nothing

I've had excellent luck with Tweezerman products in the past, but the quality of this blackhead remover was second-rate.  The item consists of a hollow metal tube with two screw-in attachments.

Neither attachments really work.  The threading of both seems to be flawed.  And to use it as intended would mean to press an unstable attachment against your face; no thanks!

My e-mailed request for re-threading or replacement to Tweezerman went unanswered.  This purchase was an expensive mistake

Wanting to try  something new, I picked up this little spritz. I was looking for an engergizing 'pick-me-up' that I could use in the middle of the day. I won't purchase this item again. After regular use, I did not find any difference in my skin (normal-oily, make-up free), did not experience any engergizing feeling, and quickly discovered that this product tastes terrible. The directions state to 'close your eyes and spray 10cm from you face' but this method lands the product on your lips - that would be how I discovered the awful taste.

The one redeeming value I have for this product is the scent; I'm a huge fan of citrus based scents. But that benefit does not justify the cost of this product.

I received the vanilla grapefruit sticks as a gift from one of My boys.  The sticks are very thin and only burn about halfway down the entire length.  Re-lighting is useless bc there is no fragrance left at the bottom half of the stick to burn.  The scent doesn't remind Me of vanilla grapefruit- more like plain burning sticks, which won't cost you $13.  Votivo does candles well, but the aromatic sticks leave something to be desired.  Not worth the money.

I ordered this product because it was recommended to me on another skincare website.  However, I haven't wanted to use this product much due to it's odor.  Very medicinal/chemical smelling.  Makes me wonder what sort of harsh chemicals are going on my face!  I used it pretty consistently the first two weeks and didn't notice any difference in my skin.  I wouldn't recommend this product, unless a dermatologist specifically tells you to use it.

This item was fine when it came to pictures; tattoos were not visible on film for the first part of our wedding. However I was told by a few of the guests that it looked like I had been in a fight before the wedding... make-up should not look like bruises!
The make-up also started to fade not long after the ceremony ended, and it was a short ceremony.  By the end of the reception (four hours later) you could clearly see the tattoos.
Also, I was told that the make-up would not rub off onto clothing if I used the special setting powder together with the cream... Not true.  I now have make-up stains on one of my brides maids dresses.
I realize now that I should have just let the tattoos show.  Why have a tattoo if you're not willing to show it off

Dermablend Leg and Body Cover reminds me alot of mud.  You know how you get mud on your shoes and it is dark at first but then dries to look alot lighter and flakes off?  That's a very accurate comparison to this product.  It sets to a very chalky, dry, finish which appears flaky and has a pasty, corpse like gray tinge to it.  It is creepy looking!  Even with all of the colors that are available it still looks unnatural and ashy when dry. 
The only way I was able to use it was to cover my tattoo with the product and then disguise the hideously fake makeup under a pair of thick, shimmery dance tights!! You couldn't pull it off with just the makeup on your bare skin though.
It would be great if you want to dress up like a mummy or decaying corpse for Halloween though

Okay so in the beginning, I was so excited about this perfume.  It smelled AMAZING and the scent lasted FOREVER.  When I say forever, literally forever.  You spray it on after your shower in the afternoon and then go to sleep?  It lasts until the next afternoon.  It's not even just a weak scent that's left on you.  It's like as if you've been spraying it constantly. 

But here's the bad part.  After using it for awhile, I felt sick in the stomach becuase the scent was so strong.  I felt like the scent was a little too deep.  It's great for people who like strong distinct scents.  If not though, this isn't the product for you

This was my first cologne purchase.  It's a really delicious scent -- complex and pleasant, not overpowering.  Give it 15 min to dry and mix with your skin.  It truly does smell different from the first spray.  I can't stop smelling myself...I really love the smell.

My only complaint (and it's a biggy) is that it doesn't last for more than a few hours.  After two or three hours it's completely gone except for a slight trace when I press my nose to my skin.  I've tried spraying it on my body (neck, wrists) and also my clothing, and it just doesn't last.  I feel the need to carry the bottle with me and reapply it every few hours, but that's not going to realistically happen.  It's really disappointing, since it's so delicious

There is absolutely nothing special about this leave-in conditioner, besides the fact that it smells really good.  However, I didn't see any changes in my daughter's hair after using this conditioner.  NONE.  It is watered down so you must rub it in your hair very quickly. Otherwise, it will run down your face and neck (wish it came with a spray pump instead).  I was expecting some sort of difference since this product line is well-known and has a lot of star/ celebrity power behind it.  However, I found this conditioner to be all hype

I bought the entire line of products from the Lisa's Hair Regimen on the Carol's daughter website. I took all the products back to Sephora yesterday. I used this Hair oil on my scalp and the next day my scalp started itching. I washed it that night and woke up the next morning in serious pain. I wear my hair natural and I had what felt like chemical burns all over my scalp. When I took the product back to Sephora the lady who sold it to me told me my scalp was RED w/ white spots all throughout it. I had to take OTC pain medication twice a day for three days just to help me sleep at night due to the pain. The only thing I can attribute it to is an allergic reaction. The product contain extracts from different types of plant and flowers. If you have allergies to these items I would suggest not using this product. I contacted Carol's Daughter and have not heard back from them yet. I would have expected more from the company who's product states 'Made with Love, Peace'.

OK, so this is the 2nd Philosophy product that I've tried and felt the need to write a review on. I have to say, this product is far below expectations. I sprayed in on, and the only thing you smell is the alcohol. There seems to be no other notes to it, even after you let it settle, all you can pick up is alcohol. Definitely not recommending this product.

I was very unhappy with this product. First the shipping took way too long. Second, the tube is much smaller than sold at Macy's and the cost is more. And the contents were gross, very goopy. Not smooth. Like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months. I'll fight the mall to buy this next time

My sister-in-law bought this product for me after I had admired the shade (Purr, a light baby pink color) that she was wearing. I have used other MAC products before with great results, but was VERY dissapointed with this product. 

First of all, I gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. However, this product is sticky. VERY sticky! It does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. Not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. When I wear a lip gloss, I want to be soft and smooth feeling. I want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak. 

Also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. This will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. Very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!  

This product seems to be popular with other viewers, however, I would never reccomend this to anyone

This stuff is supposed to help razor burn, ingrown hairs. Honestly after all the time using it I can't honestly say if it works. What I can say is that it smells terrible. Not a weak terrible smell, but a strong, overpowering stink.
It also burns like crazy when you put it on.

The Tend Skin company puts out this story about a miraculous discovery - a dentists patient came to him after a tooth extraction and raved that whatever the anesthetic was that he was given, it had cured his ingrown hairs.

Well, there are three ingredients in tend skin - alcohol, glycerin, and aspirin. Thats it.
So apparently this dental patient had been cured of ingrown hairs by taking an aspirin.

Bottom line is, this product is insanely overpriced, and they hide it with this distortion, this silly propaganda about its "miraculous discovery."

A little bottle of alcohol and aspirin should cost a tenth of this

I have always had problems with razor burn and shaving issues overall.  It used to be a disaster and I was introduced and used Tend Skin for the past two or three years now.  I got a sample of Solution 2 out in the Hamptons last weekend and I could not possibly be happier.  It is a significant improvement over Tend Skin--the roller ball applicator is brilliant and I have officially (thankfully) pitched my cotton ball bag.  It does not sting nearly as much as Tend Skin.  It smells so much better (actually pretty good!) and it works better too.  I used to get very dry patches on my neck from using Tend Skin but I have had no dryness issues with Solution 2.  I used to have a strict regimen using Tend Skin in order to get through my shaving procedure.  Now, I roll on the Solution 2 and it's all good:)

I really do not feel tend skin works as advertised. The irritation to my neck persisted and if anything had only gotten worse after applying as instructed. One good thing is that you if you are like me and have trouble waking up in the morning --- tend skin helps for that! Just take a strong whiff and you'll be alert and ready for your day!

I used to use Tend Skin. It works ok, but there are better things out there now. Tend Skin is an outdated product...like the sytptic pencil. Tend Skin stings, smells like pure alcohol and there is lots of wasted product because it is easy to spill. I recently switched to MiN Solution2 like it much better than Tend Skin. MiN Solution2 has a roller application (no waste), organic spearmint (fresh smell) and doesn't burn like Tend Skin.

i received my order of three oils...jasmine,ambergris, and musk...their fragrance was so obscured by the oil medium that you cut the essential oil with that they all smelled very close to the same...i have caswellmassey oils from 30 years ago and they are still true to their fragrance and it is true...one drop will last all day and often linger for more...have they sold out or sold their name
 
i only ordered three oils because somewhere i read if you order 25 dollars or more from you the shipping was free...this was not the case...i was charged for shipping
 
these products i received are a joke...the caswellmassey name is no longer associated with an exemplary product...i am sure the original caswellmassey folks are turning over in their graves every time you send this "jokeoil" to an unsuspecting customer...shame on you...shame on you all

This mascara works great; it lengthens, separates, and defines your lashes and it doesn't smudge, but it's so hard to take off!  I used Lancome's Bi-Facil makeup remover, which is designed to remove waterproof mascara, but it was still hard to remove.  I lost quite a few lashes in the process.  I would recommend buying the regular Definicils, not the waterproof

After reading the great reviews of the votivo candles I decided to spend the rediculous sum of $24 on a moroccan spice candle.When I received the candle I smelled sweet spice coming from it even before I opened the packaging.Readying myself for a rocket of rich fragrance immersing my room in exotic spice I hopefully lit the candle.After about an hour of the candle being lit I came into my room and it scented only about 3 feet around the candle.Dissapointed, and perhaps to prove that there was absolutely no way I didn't get jacked on this purchase I lit it again-this time for 3 hours.There was still no smell.Compare this with the $6 'tea' candles I bought from the Gold Canyon Candle Co. which when I lit 6 of them richly scented not only my room (which is about 13' 13') but the hallway, as well as my mothers room next door (16' 16')!If your thinking that maybe the $22+ dollars would be worth it for the exotic fragrances-think again as there was nothing special about the scent that you couldn't get from the grocery store. Jipped-you bet

I have tried the LUSH products and found them kinda good but then my friend introduced me to the MELT product line. Any benefits I thought I was getting from LUSH... out the window. Their products seemed, all the sudden, unimpressive. And I really like that MELT is Denver based! Try them out and see what you think for yourself (If you aren't here in Colorado I know they have online products too) and make your own choice. I recomend them though and I have told everyone I know to switch! :-

Like the Fresh Farmacy, I bought this soap based on the reviews and ended up giving it to a friend at work.  Don't get me wrong, I love most of Lush's products and, to my husbands chagrin, end up spending a lot of money on their online products but when I got this particular soap I just couldn't get into it.  I admit that it smelled a bit better after showering with it for the first time but still found myself reaching for my "Sexy Peel" over this stuff.  I ended up giving it to a friend that I work with but only after it had been passed over my three other girls in my office...I'm just not getting the "heavenly scent" that this item was described as having in previous reviews

This product didn't work for me, as described. 

First of all, it does smell nice, which is different from the usual fumes nail polishes give off! Smells lemony! 

Its also easy to use - you brush it on over nails and surrounding area, let it set for awhile until it gets dull and then gently buff it off with a tissue. 

That was all fine and dandy, but it didn't leave my nails all that dry, nor did it leave them shiny. In fact, they were less shiny than the shiny topcoats I use. 

I also had the worse case of bedsheet wrinkles embedded in my manicure that night after using this product - could be unrelated, but I've never seen so many creases and smudges in my nails when I woke up and I let them dry for a few hours after painting them! 

I wouldn't recommend this product.

I bought this for my wife for the holidays, it was a bit expensive for a candle but I believed that it would last a long time and burn uniformly. However, in our case, after about an hour the candle went out. The wick burned too quickly, becoming too small, and now the candle won't stay lit for more than a few minutes before it drowns in the wax. The return shipping will cost a lot, so we will just toss it out. Waste of money, don't buy one

I got Very Irresistible by Givenchy Perfume as a gift for Christmas.  As first smell, I loved it.  Then I spritzed it and yikes! That was 2 months ago and I still have the scent on me.

It's too flowery -- it's not a clean, fresh scent.  More of a "I sprayed a little too much potpouri in here" scent.  Not for people with mild allergies to perfumes either!!

If you're really looking forward to brightening your blonde, go to the salon and ask for a non-ammonia hair lightening or use an OTC temporary product.  Chamomile would have to be used every day for months to really make a change in your color.  The expense of this product is not justified by the results, and while LUSH likes to toot its horn about being "natural", that designation could apply to arsenic.  It's pretty meaningless when combined with artificial preservatives on the top ten list for dangerous additives - the parabens

I'm Black and for my hair type, 4b, I try to use natural products on my hair and it didn't have those "no-no chemicals and oils" that are known to be damaging to black hair.  

Well this product did not, as it advertised, which was to "stay put."  I tried to use it with my hair clean and dry and then with my hair clean and damp and it did nothing both times to hold my comb-coils or finger-coil in place.  

I did give the product 2 stars because it does smell pretty good.  Sad thing is that I can't get my money back. I use it as a hair grease for my scalp. I hope I've been helpful

I ordered the Saturday Morning Special gift set and tried the Tui Herbal Shampoo right away.  As with everyone else, no lather and lots of tangles.  After the second wash, I decided to use my Pantene Relaxed and Natural to try and get some lather and moisture in my hair.  This stuff is a rip off.  On the plus side, it works fabulously on my children's hair. They are bi-racial and have naturally curly hair.  I don't recommend this to anyone with relaxed hair.  It just doesn't work

Maybe my expectations were too high due to the hype surrounding these products.  However, this shampoo did not work for me.  Like the previous reviewer said, it was watery and did not lather at all.  It also made my hair feel stripped and left it very hard.  I followed up with a hair smoothie, but a large amount of my hair broke off due to how dry and unmanageable the product left my hair.  I do not recommend this at all

This shampoo is so bad that I thought perhaps the wrong product had been put into a shampoo bottle by mistake. It is watery and does not lather. My hair felt like it hadn't been washed for days, and the next day I had to use a different shampoo to get rid of the film. I never write reviews but felt this might save someone from wasting $10.00

All I can say is DO NOT buy this [...].  I just got this stuff and used it for the first and LAST time.  It smells horrible.  It left a wax like film over my hair that was so bad I could not even get a comb through it.  I had to wash my hair (with a different product of course) at least 6 times to get it back to normal again...........WHAT A COMPLETE RIP OFF!!!

I received two sizeable chunks of Karma soap in a couple of my orders and I thought I'd give it a go.  EEEEP - there's a whole bunch of patchouli in there (which I hate, but still thought I should at least try).  Maybe I'm overly sensitive to the patchouli but it was so strong.  The soap as a whole smelled like a sickening mix of syrup-y orange soda mixed with that dreaded patchouli.  To be fair though, you CAN smell different elements in it and appreciate it for that.  Aside from this, this soap melts incredibly fast.  Even if you keep it in a draining soap dish, even if you take it completely out of the shower, away from the steam,  it still melts at an alarming rate!

I can see how people (who love herbal scents) would like this.  It IS a unique scent that has depth and layers to it,  but it's just not for me

I have glorious white hair, and I thought this would be good for it.  But it seems to dry my hair too much, and frankly I don't see that it's any better than the two dollar bottle of Suave that's out there. I've also used Lush's BIG shampoo and Soak 'n' Float shampoo bars, and I like them much better.

I have to agree with another reviewer. This product is not worth the price tag. It claims to have a vanilla scent, and it does, but it is barely noticible. Don't buy this product based on how it smells. As a moisturizer, you can do much better for $23.00.

The shipping was very slow and the product really isn't worth $23 with shipping for an 11 oz jar.  The product goes on like Lubriderm where it feels like you are just smearing water on your skin.  Then it starts to feel a little oily but once you get dressed your skin just feel like you have powder all over skin.  Overall it was just ok but it ended up not being what I expected or wanted.  I was looking for a really good long lasting moisturizer.

Like said in an earlier review, after a couple weeks the mirror quits working and fogs up so bad you can't see a thing in it in the shower.  I run hot water on it and it still fogs up after a couple minutes, then you can't clear it with any method.  Total waste, not worth a dollar.

I love Laura Mercier's skin products, but her makeup line has these dark, cherry-burnt-orange-rasberry colors that just don't work for fair skin or  blonde hair (which I have.) I wish her colors were better, there was only 1 eye color I could wear in this kit, and the 3 glow stick things were confusing, because they weren't sticks.

I read about Bobbi Brown tinited moisturizer as a recommendation in a magazine and decided to try it.  I went to Saks and the saleswoman "made up my face" using the moisturizer.  I thought I liked the look in the store and felt the coverage stayed on all day during my shopping.  However, the next day when I applied the moisturizer alone without all the other products I discovered I didn't like it.  It went on and immediately the product seemed to sink into the pores of my skin and also seemed cakey.  I am going to return this product and the concealer that I bought as well.  This product just doesn't apply very smoothly.  I think I will try the Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer that everyone is raving about instead

As rosey as this oils smells, it just isn't as good as the real thing.  Being a fragrance oil, it has no medicinal properties.  I certainly wouldn't use it on my skin, or in a bath!  Thanks, but no thanks.  You definitely get what you pay for

When I first spray Inis Energy of the Sea Cologne Spray, I could not smell any thing! Then I spray more and more 'till I found out how it smells! It has nice scent, Okay, I'll tell you how I found it; it is not bad! 
BUT despite that, it doesn't last for more than half an hour, and then it hardly can be smelled. You may need to have it with you all the time and spray every half hour. This is what disappointed me the most!
I am telling you my taste here, that isn't necessarily yours.

 I was very excited to receive this product,yet my enthusiasm quickly turned to confusion.Call me foolish,but I thought perfume was to have a sweet,pleasant aroma{?. This pot had the distinct scent of a citronella {skeeter} candle...like the one I could smell burning from my neighbors yard last Summer!!!! I kept applying and re-applying it to "get a smell" from it...Not much luck. Maybe the spray perfume smells far better??? I do not understand how the founder says this perfume gets so many compliments!How? If I rubbed the bug candle wax on my wrists, I WOULD NOT have gals clammoring around me asking me what I was wearing!!!!I wore this a few times just to see the reactions.....Only 1 person said they could "sota" smell something! I tried Paris Hilton, and Britney's fantasy, and got TONS of compliments! Buy at your own discretion

Falling in Love is one of my favorite scents ever.  It's basically my go-to fragrance for everyday.  If you're a fan of this scent you already know it's really pretty but very light.  That's why I was exited about the solid for touch-ups on the go.  Let me tell you, subtle is an understatement for this product. When I opened the seal and held it under my nose I could hardly smell it.  When I applied it (generously) to my wrist the scent was barely detectable.  I rubbed my wrists together to gently warm the perfume and it didn't help at all.  I expected this to be fairly concentrated so that little dabs would suffice.  Very disappointing.

I received this soap free with an online purchase. I have never purchased soap from Lush and I don't think I will after my experience with Ooh La La. The scent is pleasant enough, and the color of the bar is this stunning deep purple (kind of like a grape!), but it doesn't feel like soap when I'm using it. It kind of smears a purplish film on me and then when I rinse it off, my skin feels very tight and dry. I've been unable to get any lather from this bar, although admittedly I do have very hard water where I live. I read that previous reviewers complained about how long this soap lasts. Like with all Lush products, it's imperative that you not leave it in the shower or tub and let it dry completely between uses. I've used the bar four or five times and while it's noticeably smaller than when I opened it, I probably have about 90 percent of it left.

I was looking forward to a lovely lavender scent when I got this soap,  but sadly, that's not what happened.  The smell is a very strong herbal;  like the kind you would add to an Italian pasta dish.   Not very appealing!  There is some complexity to the scent, but it's so overshadowed by the herb smell to really come through.  On the plus side,  the color is beautiful (a rich, dark purple) and the lather is equally lovely to look at.  If you like true herbal scents, then you should give this a try.  

It just wasn't for me.

Love that when amazon deletes all the reviews for a product! Well, this one used to have about 3 five-star ratings. I added my two cents- this product did nothing for me whatsoever. So, some people love it. I don't get it. And, it's pretty much the opposite of an anti-oxidant, so that doesn't make sense. I pointed this out in my review. Wonder if vendors have the choice to delete all reviews if they get one bad enough?

Also, it's listed at $45 on amazon as well. from the same supplier. huh

I can truly say that this products doesn't work. I have silky wavy fine hair and I am a hair food junkie so I used a lot of things, but this don't work. Usually anything can tame my hair but all this conditioner do is make it hard, matted, and tangled. Carol Daughter's products may work for some, but it hasn't work for anyone in my family and we all have different hair textures

I ordered the gift set and it came as advertised. Very cute package. Unfortunately no one sells this product on the east coast (that I could find) so I could not test it. It is far too strong a scent, even the lotion. The candle filled the house with the scent in 10 minutes. My advice, find someone or someplace that offers this product before purchasing

I really wanted this to work.  I have serious dark circles under my eyes and have tried everything else.  But I've been using this twice a day for two months and I haven't noticed any improvement at all.  Not even a little.  In fact, my eyes might actually look worse.  It has not faded the dark circles, nor has it improved the bags.

I fell for the hype and now am out quite a bit of money....... Save your money, trust me! I used this product 2-3 times a day until the entire tube was gone (took several months) and saw NO change whatsoever! I have serious dark circles, which is what it claims to help. I am VERY disappointed with this company and their product and will never buy any item with their name on it again! What a bunch of crap......   BTW - look at *all* the reviews, this product is listed in several places here !!

After I ordered this product, one of my co-workers told me about the reviews on Amazon.  I checked it out and I was really surprised!  The reviews are poor.  The worst part, though, is that the product is listed three times!!  What's the deal??  A product gets a bad review, so they re-list it... more bad reviews and they re-list it AGAIN!  See for yourself, do a general search for "Hylexin" and you will see several listings of the SAME product.  Trying to out run bad reviews????  I now think less of the product AND Amazon.  Shame on you both

The click-stick applicator is ridiculous. You have no control over the shadow. When you click it, nothing comes out. You have to twist about ten times, and then, suddenly, a huge blob, enough for eighteen applications, comes busting out. The only way I've found to apply this is to use my own shadow brush dipped in this huge blob. I purchased three colors at the same time and all three tubes work in this same way. As far as the actual shadow, it's fine. Nothing spectacular. You could get the same product from Wet'N Wild for a buck.

I have an ancient Lancome facial brush that I was attempting to replace.  I bought this brush, tried it, and went back to my old one.  In my opinion, this brush is far too soft and doesn't feel like it is cleaning at all.  A wash cloth would be better

I have horrible bags and deep creases along edge of preorbital area. Of all the products I have tried, Olay Regenerist eye cream works the best. Also my plastic surgeon said that part of the dark purple is my muscle showing thru because I have excess skin but no fat in periorbital area. He said he will inject fat from my rear(plenty) and that will lessen the color, and after he removes excess skin, he will use laser

I paid $100.00 for a tube of Hylexin because I have serious dark circles.  Unfortunately, I fell for the hype because I would have tried anything that says, "Significantly reduces dark circles!"  I followed the directions and waited....NOTHING!  I teach Business Ehtics at a University.  Part of the course involves ethics in advertising.  I use the Hylexin example of how people are duped by the wording, the packaging, etc.
Please take my word for it and save yourself some money

I have eczema, so my scalp is very dry and sensitive. This relaxer burned my hair so severely I though it would fall out. I developed huge scores with thick scabs after having this relaxer professionally applied to my hair.

I used Phytospecific Relaxer on my virgin hair during the summer (2006). I first thought it to be a great investment ($60) and worth the cost. After use, I found my hair to be relaxed but not "bone straight" as I've experienced with other relaxers which is what I desired. My hair is very soft and fine and quite sensitive to chemicals so I was in search of a product that would straighten my hair and not leave any damaging affects.

After the 2nd treatment (September 2006), I soon found that my hair was experiencing breakage around the temples and severe breakage at the nape of my neck. I quit using the product.

Perhaps this product works for some but as mentioned earlier, my hair is quite sensitive to chemicals and unfortunately, I experienced hair loss! So, it's back to the drawing (or growing) board for me

I am black American and have combination hair...nappy, wavy and straight.  I've been using drug store relaxers for over 30 years (CrÃ¨me of Nature, TCB, Dark &amp; Lovely, Revlon Realistic) whatever is "on sale" with satisfying results.   These products leave my hair evenly straight and shiny but hard and stiff immediately after the process.  I usually wash my hair after a few days (I like to give it a rest after relaxing) and use a good conditioner to soften and detangle.  From there I am able to go about 12 weeks before having to retouch.  In general my hair is healthy and responds well to straightners.  My biggest expense is with conditioning products to maintain my hair.  I'll try anything and spend any amount if it works well on my hair.  I have great success with Frederic Fekkai products and love Phytodefrisant Botanical Hair Relaxing Balm...this stuff is amazing if you like to wash and go (air dry) and it works wonders with blow drying/flat ironing too.  (Bumble and Bumble Styling Spray is another amazing product for great flat ironing results.)

I forked out $60 to try Phtyo2 after reading all the rave reviews.  I am satisfied with the outcome but not blown away.  Yes, Phyto2 did not smell bad, it did not burn my scalp and it did straighten my hair but no better than Dark and Lovely or TCB, and my hair was still hard and stiff afterward.

It has been several weeks and my hair is doing great, but again no different from when I use Dark &amp; Lovely.  I guess I am lucky that my hair responds well to ANY type of relaxer so I doubt I'll be spending another $60 for Phyto2...I'd rather buy two tubes of Phytodefrisant Balm and continue to with my $7.99 drug store brands.  I hope this helps someone with similar hair as mine.  If you do well with drug store brands, Phyto results are not that different...spend the money on their other products that nourish and condition your hair

The instructions say, "Use whenever your skin needs a boost."  It goes on to imply that you will see a result every time you use it - it's not one of these products where you need to use it repeatedly to see results.  I bought it at a big upscale department store and used it that night.  Now that winter is approaching, my skin gets a little wacky at times.

The product comes out as a gel but becomes creamy as you apply it on the damp skin.  The instructions are to leave it on until a "full froth" forms (approximately 5 minutes), then rinse off.

The cream began to take on the consistency of foam after about 2 minutes, and at the end of 5 minutes the foam was beginning to dissipate and leave big empty patches on my skin, so I rinsed it off.  

My skin didn't look any different when done.  It didn't feel any different when done.  For $52 I expected at least some type of visible change - even if it made my skin redder, or plumper, or something.

Unfortunately the box is now in the bottom of the trash, so I can't return it.  We have Christmas guests coming; maybe one of them will enjoy using it

I bought the entire line of products from the Lisa's Hair Regimen on the Carol's daughter website. I took all the products back to Sephora yesterday. I used this Hair oil on my scalp and the next day my scalp started itching. I washed it that night and woke up the next morning in serious pain. I wear my hair natural and I had what felt like chemical burns all over my scalp. When I took the product back to Sephora the lady who sold it to me told me my scalp was RED w/ white spots all throughout it. I had to take OTC pain medication twice a day for three days just to help me sleep at night due to the pain. The only thing I can attribute it to is an allergic reaction. The product contain extracts from different types of plant and flowers. If you have allergies to these items I would suggest not using this product. I contacted Carol's Daughter and have not heard back from them yet. I would have expected more from the company who's product states 'Made with Love, Peace'.

Until a couple of years ago this used to be the gold standard of leave-ins:  It made my dry, curly hair soft, shiny, and smelling great!  But lately something has changed. The once thick, silky liquid has turned thin and watery, with a distinctly alcohol-like smell.  It's so disappointing... this product has gone from 5 to 2 stars in my book.  Don't bother with it anymore, unless the original formula comes back

In all honesty, I'd rate the fragrance itself as "5 stars," however, the scent does not last for love nor money, which is why I give it a mere "1 star."  You'll find that you have to continuously apply it in order for anyone to compliment you on it and, consequently, before you know it, you've depleted your perfume!  Talk to anyone who has worn or even sells this fragrance and, if they're honest, they will tell you exactly what I've written here.  Because I adore the scent, I'm going to try the Baby Phat Goddess Body Lotion and see if that has a lingering effect

i think this product would be great, but wasn't able to use it becasue the description of it on this website and on phiolosphy's website does't give you one tiny bit of information.  the very last step, the very last sentence says that you shouldn't use this product if you are prone to breakouts because this will cause a severe breakout.  the reason i bought this was to clear up my face, so it would have been nice to know this before i am about to apply it to my skin

This didn't do anything for me. Is it supposed to have very subtle cumulative effect? I am returning it. I'm really surprised others had such great results, because I tried it twice and left it on for double the time, and still it did nothing more than wash my face and maybe moisturize with the cream. It does have more than baking soda and H2O2- also contains catalase, some stearic acid, and some vitamin C. Of course, your skin already has its own catalase.

i've read so many positive reviews about this and i wanted to buy it so very much. but when i got around to actually smell it...i was so dissapointed, i can only smell an old lady perfume, a bug spray, i don't know, something so strong and not strong in the right way. my favourites are Dior J'adore, Red Delicious, Intuition( Estee Lauder), try them instead if you want to feel sexy and powerful

Ok Ive been Using Proactiv 4 about a year now and i have to say that it did work for me well like 90% with one or two breakouts a month so i was pretty pleased about that. People often asked me what i did cuz my change was drastic, so that was nice.

One night i styed up late and that Murad infomercial came on and it looked pretty convincing since there where no celebritys advertising it and they even compared it to proactiv, so i tough i would give it a try so i ordered it online the next day.

Couple Of Days later i received the package and i was pretty exited so i began to use it and liked the overall feel of it. few days pass by and i wake up one morning with all these little white heads in my upper chin and i was immidiately grossed out but since they said it was normal due to purging i didnt worry much, one week later it got worse and even began breaking out in places i hadnt before like in my forehead. I knew somethign wasnt right so i went online and started reading other custumer reviews and was shocked at the similaruty of thwe problem so i freaked out and decided to stop using it because it got so bad to the point where i didnt wanna be seen and on top of that it became very painful both physically and mentally i becamed sorth of depressed about the situation i sorth of felt like a teen going trough puberty again. 

I Have now gone back to proactiv and seen improvement so hopefully within the next couple of weeks it will clear up again untill then i wanna crawl under a rock hahaha. My main advice is to really do ur research before trying something new because u may end up worse than before

I purchased the Murad Acne Complex for $40 or so (for a measley one month supply).  I was disgustingly excited to try it, as everything else has failed me.  Proactiv works wonderfully for me, but only for the first month or two, then it seems I grow an immunity to it.

I paid to have the Murad Acne Complex expedited to me because I was so anxious to get on to 'beautiful, clear skin.'  I read the pamphlet, and understood that my skin could go through a "purging" phase, where your skin literally purges all of the bacteria and other acne causing assailants.  Imagine the worst skin you've ever seen.  Imagine the most painful breakouts.  That was my personal "purging" process.  It was literally the worst breakout of my entire life.  My husband kept telling me to continue using the products though, because this was expected.  I'm STILL using the products, and though my skin is better than it was 3 weeks ago, I'm basically back where I was when I started.  

I give up.  But I'm not giving up any more money to Murad

Like the others I was disappointed after a couple times using this product.  And like the others I started to breakout where I had not broken out before, on my forehead etc.  I bought this product because I had problem areas.  Using this product brought out more problem areas and dried out my skin.  I used the product as prescribed. 

The commercial said it was gentle and what made this product different from the rest was that it wouldn't cause acne only with it's "gentle" formula help it with immediate results.  NOT TRUE at all.  This is just like any other product on the market for acne.  If you have the Weeks of pain and suffering and embarrassing breakouts more than what you had before to get results, this is the product for you.  I, on the other hand, couldn't deal with the additional embarrassment of my skin getting worse before it got better.  When my trouble areas weren't that bad in the first place.

Not recommended as they advertise.  They aren't different than the others.  Proactive does the same thing.

This product should be listed only for people with REALLY oily skin.  It dried my combination skin out so bad that it got red, flaky, and it hurt!  I also got horrible pimples all over my face due to over drying.  This is actually harsher than Proactive.. Unless your skin covered in oil,  it probably wont be able to handle it.  Good luck getting your refund, I'm still waiting for mine.  I also cancelled the shipments twice and they keep charging me and sending them

I first smelled this perfume on a strip in a magazine. I fell in love with both the bottle, and the scent instantaneously. I decided when I had some extra cash I would buy it or hopefully drop enough hints to get it for Christmas. Christmas came and went and no Fantasy, instead I recieved Celine Dion's fragrance. I liked the smell of the Dion but was still sad that I didn't get what I wanted. I decided to buy the fantasy for myself. Upon finding it at a makeup counter I became rather thankful I got the other. I think Fantasy smells a lot like this cotton candy spray I had in elementary school. mmmm to smell like a 4th grader again. The bottle is elegant, but the scent is juvenile. It'd be appropriate for preteens, but not grown women, then again, should I be surprised? I suppose the scent caters well to Spears' followers, 12 year olds

I really wanted to like this one but just couldn't get past the smell.   It was really over-powering.  Lush makes some really lovely smelling soaps but this isn't one of them.  I didn't find it drying though and it did lather very nicely.  It was just too strongly scented for my liking

I didn't know you were supposed to peel that waxy rubbery black stuff off the soap...I normally get store-bought olive oil soap but it smelled so good, I had to try it.  I ended up COVERED with black, waxy streaks all over my body when I got out of the shower!  They didn't rinse off, either.  The only thing that seemed to work was to rub really vigorously with a towel...I still had black smudges and a wax residue.  Once I figured out how to take a knife to the coating, I had a better opinion of the soap, except that it pretty much cut the soap in half.  It smelled really nice, but I don't think I would get this again.

I generally love Lush soaps, but do not recommend this one. Demon in the Dark has a great name, but it doesn't smell very good (a sort of faint, slightly minty scent). It also has a black wax coating that is rather difficult to peel or scrape off, but must be removed for the soap to work properly.  I would try Red Rooster or Karma soap instead

Ick.  I bought Ultra Light Kirsch because I thought it would be similar to a discontinued grapey color that I used to love by Loreal.

Smell - Fake grade-school grape-aid smell grossed me out.

Feel - I LIKE lip gloss that feels glossy.  This stuff did not shine enough or last long enough.

Color - The color was to mild for me.  

I was very disappointed.  I felt like I had wasted money and time. I still recommend Loreal Lip Juice, though. I believe it's the same company, and Lip Juice is glossy, shiny, long-lasting and way more cost-effective

I had very high hopes for this cream, as it appears they went the extra mile for quality. Not so. The cream when used leaves alot of friction as the razor goes over your face, making for some tense moments that should not be there.
I have used many creams. So far Art of Shaving is the best. Casswell Massey is ok as is Aveda. Avoid Truefitt.

Update. 
Trufitt and Hill accepted the return and we spoke about the problems. They sent me a new updated extra fine version that should be available to the public now that is of the same quality as Massey. It is good. The standard is still substandard

I received this as a Christmas gift and loved the smell of it.  After my second time using it, I broke out in a terrible itchy rash. There is a warning on the bottle that it may cause skin and urinary tract irritation.  Do not buy it if you have even mildly sensitive skin.  The smell is great, but is gone after you get out of the shower.

I just used this product in a bath. It's supposed to be a Cinnamon smelling bubble bath, shampoo rinse, shower gel. Well first of all, I almost had to swallow my own lungs to smell any cinnamon, this is REALLY weak smelling. (I am a real scent meister too.) I used it as a bubble bath, guess what? The bubbles were gone within minutes. Stick with the Avon bubble bath, it still has bubbles in the tub when you are done! Then I used it as a shampoo. Guess what? It didn't lather! I ended up using the trusty Suave to finish the bath. Very disapointing product! I bought the 32oz. for myself as a Christmas present, can't wait till it's gone

I have worked with two women who have worn this perfume, and frankly, I can't stand the smell of it. It doesn't even smell like perfume, it is like some bizarre animal musk. There are no floral notes, and no woodsy notes, either; nothing clean or fresh or pleasant. I wish this perfume didn't exist---I hate it.

I have thick coarse hair and was looking for something to make it softer.  I Used just a little bit and it was really greasy.  I am currently using Lanza Anti Aging Plant Serum.  It works much better

I wouldn't recommend this product to a person with long hair like myself. After using this so called "Instant detangler" my hair was more tangled then ever. In my opinion any cheap hair conditioner from a drug store will do a better job

I was very unhappy with this product. First the shipping took way too long. Second, the tube is much smaller than sold at Macy's and the cost is more. And the contents were gross, very goopy. Not smooth. Like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months. I'll fight the mall to buy this next time

My sister-in-law bought this product for me after I had admired the shade (Purr, a light baby pink color) that she was wearing. I have used other MAC products before with great results, but was VERY dissapointed with this product. 

First of all, I gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. However, this product is sticky. VERY sticky! It does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. Not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. When I wear a lip gloss, I want to be soft and smooth feeling. I want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak. 

Also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. This will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. Very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!  

This product seems to be popular with other viewers, however, I would never reccomend this to anyone

This product will claim to be on the same level of the tools that dermatologists use to extract blackheads.  But don't count on any instructions included to tell you how to use this little rod. 

I did some searching on the Internet for a clue, and all directions simply said you press the loop firmly against the blackhead to extract the comedones.  Well that left a red circle on my face and made tears come out of my eyes ...but left the blackhead firmly in place.

If there is a better way to use this tool I highly doubt it will produce effective results.  There is simply nothing unique or different about the little metal loops than the end of your fingers.  Don't waste your money on this pathetic product

It only takes a little bit of reading to realize that abrading the skin with a piece of metal is NOT the solution for ending blackheads/enlarged pores. Using this "extractor" is equal to using one's fingers to squeeze out imperfections, which may produce very temporary results, but is ultimately fruitless. Those who feel a need to purchase this device should invest in professional deep-cleaning instead, which will rid the skin of excess oil and help the pores to close without aggravation

I used herbalism for a few weeks after discovering lush products through a friend. My face, esp. my forehead became very greasy, and every pore on my forehead became inflamed. I thought it was stress and continued using it until my next lush run when they gave me a sample of aquamarina. My face cleared up instantly. When the aquamarina ran out I went back to herbalism, but -surprise- the skin problems reemerged. Now, I'm using aquamarina instead and love it, though you can't get it through amazon for some reason. Check the lush website. I'm sure this won't happen to everyone, but give that pink glop a try instead

Disappointingly, this tape did not perform as well as hoped. It was unable to hold medium or heavier weight fabrics in place. Using a one-inch piece under bra straps did not keep them from slipping, the tape and straps eventually started rolling. And it definitely was unable to help prevent a strapless bra from succumbing to Newton's law of gravity! So not only did fashion faux-pas continue to occur, the tape caused a rash/skin irritation with each use.

At 23, I don't have "age" wrinkles around my eyes, but I have laugh lines that I want to soften. This product has done nothing for my laugh lines. I could have spent the same amount of money on something else that works. Skin growth factors available on ebay helped rebuild the skin in the creases of my laugh lines. This product did not.

I was talked into buying this product for minor fine lines. This product that I used for 4 months, showed no signifigant results as well as any other product Ive used by Estee Lauder. Dont waste your money on it. I usually look at it like this. If any cosmetic retailer offer a free gift with purchase it usually needs one to go with it. This product is crap!

Why did Shiseido have to ruin a good idea with a sub-par SPF? They got the broad spectrum part correct by using Avobenzone as the active sunscreen ingredient but then came up far short to the widely preferred SPF 15. UVA/UVB SPF 15 or more is a standard widely recommended by dermatologists, the Skin Cancer Foundation, the American Academy of Dermatology, and others. Plus, as a moisturizer, this one is just OK. There are far better formulations on the market, even some made by Shiseido, containing not only a better daily sunscreen but antioxidents and better moisturizing ingredients

I bought TendSkin to help with the irritation and razor bumps I get on my neck from shaving. The product claims to, "reduce appearance of unsightly razor bumps, ingrown hairs, and redness from shaving." But despite it's lofty promises and high price, it does none of this. In fact in my case it made the irritation and red bumps worse, I have sensitive skin and the main ingredient of this product is alcohol. The directions tell you to apply it after shaving, but because alcohol dries out your skin and is painful to apply after shaving, it only made my problem worse. I wish I could have rated this product zero stars, because it is absolutely worthless

I used Tend Skin for a few years and it was the best one that I could find but a few weeks ago I saw a nother product on Amazon called Solution 2 and ordered it instead.  I was a little worried because I was getting good results with the bumps with Tend Skin but it burned a lot and dried out my skin quite a bit.  Solution 2 is definitely a better product for me with my sensitive skin and it works just as good on the bumps

I used this product a few times, trying to justify the money I spent.  I could leave it on my hair all day, and the effect was essentially zilch.  Hair is dead.  It doesn't matter what propaganda beauty/cosmetics companies use to promote their products, there is no way that vitamins, minerals, etc. are going to "feed" or strengthen your hair.  When the products are washed out, so is the moisture.  It was a dumb idea on my part to think putting guacamole on my hair was going to make it a)smell good b)feel good.  And it was really dumb of me to pay so much for this stuff when I could've just as easily and much more cheaply made it myself

I think I may have had a bad batch because when I read the reviews on how yummy it had smelled, made me curious. So, I tried it and I hated it! The smell of it turned my stomach. It did soften my hair a bit, but I don't recommend using it again. Sorry Lush

Let me just say that I have thick, dry frizzy hair with an oily scalp. And this shampoo bar made it an even bigger mess. It dried my hair out even more and made it so hard to manage. The smell was really good at first, very coconuty. But then after a few uses it developed a weird scent, like playdoh and pepper. So I just used up the rest of it as regular soap. It has made me somewhat wary of trying other solid shampoo bars

I tried phyto index #1 and basically, its a waste of cash.  You can get the same deal at the grocery store and it'll probably do a better job.  Let me describe my hair.  I am black, my hair is thin and breaks easily.  I can not have too heavy moisterizers because it weighs my hair down I will lose the bounce in my hair, so I always use serum.  I style my hair by blow drying and using a ceramic flat iron to get it straight, flowing, and bouncy.  The relaxer almost seem like it didn't take.  I haven't had a relaxer to do that in ages. I put this in almost a month ago and I can't wait until it grows out to put some real relaxer in.  

Also, everytime I would do a touch up, my hair would stop shedding.  With Phyto index #1, it sheds more!  With breakage strands.  I'm ok with root strands shedding, that's natural.  Next time, I will either order Mitzani relaxer online or go to a professional to put that in.  Mitzani is one of my favorites.  Number #1 is Silk II (I have no idea how to get that).  As for homekits, Optimum is good.

I was really excited for this! I hoped it would be a faster, easier way to do make up and what not, but its not.
It smears like crazy, and the end is so sharp, it hurts to apply. But that doesn't matter!
the end stops working after a use or two.
I suppose if you wanted to do make up similar to a raccoon with blueish eyes (for the black is more navy then black) you'll be happy.
I've always loved the mark products, but this is a disappointment

At first it smells very sharp and citrusy, almost like men's cologne. Then few seconds later it mellows out a bit and smells somewhat herbal. After 15 minutes you won't be able to smell it at all. Very hyped up mediocre perfume with very steep price tag. You'd be better off buying a bottle of Herbal Essence shower gel and getting identical results

I bought this product mainly because my daughter has fair, sensitive skin, which most facial wipes cause her minor irritation. This product worked very well as far as thoroughly cleaning her face, hands etc. It did not irritate her skin at all...the problem, the one and only problem, is the fragrance, if you can call it that. It stinks so bad, I did not want to go near her after I wiped her down...I had to give her a bath, it was so bad

i got this bar based on the other reviews, and boy, is it strong! the bar will last a very good long while, unless you can actually stomach the smell of gallons of patchouli without getting a major headache. patchouli was originally supposed to be a base scent for other sweeter scents to sit upon. it was never supposed to be a stand-alone perfume! 
like all the LUSH bubble bars, this definitely packs the bubbles in a small amount. i just have buyers remorse because i now have this oversized bar (and it is a very big bar), and i can only use bits of it when my fiance is out of town because he gets an allergic reaction to the strong strong STRONG smell. 
i think the upside is that it seems like the scent isn't nearly so strong once you're actually *in* the bath. or maybe by then your olfactory senses are so overwhelmed you just can't tell the difference anymore.
so yeah, if you love love LOOOOOOOOVE patchouli, then this is truly the bath bar for you. otherwise, i'd steer clear and go for something gentler. the hot milk bubble bar is the opposite of this bar, in that it's really gentle on the nose. and any of the jasmine flavored products would also be a better recommendation than this one.
i love LUSH, but not this bar

I've ordered this product a month ago.  I had mild acne, I've used a lot of Benzoyl Peroxide products etc persagel, Clearasil, etc.  One day I saw a commerical for this Murad product, which looked too good to be true.  I've ordered the product because the price was cheaper than some of the other products and it had "real people" saying the product worked.  I did follow the instructions on the 3 products.  Less than a week, my face broke out even more, I had some cystic acne which I never had before.  It was astonishing, but the company said there was a "purging" state, which I held out hope that it would be a minor setback.  2 weeks later, again I started breaking out on both sides of my face and under my neck and chin area.  I am so dumbfounded that this product said it would make a difference within a month.  It's been 1 month and 3 weeks and I am so disappointed.  I've stop using this product for the last 3 days and my skin is getting better and I've cancelled any future products from this company.  DON'T RECOMMEND IT

I developed mild acne after deciding to go off of my regular birth control pill.  Never having acne before, this was devistating.  I watched all the infomercials and decided to go with Murad's Acne Complex Kit expecting the glowing, perfect skin that they promised within a few short weeks.  I purchased the starter kit and I liked the smell of the products but after a month and a half, I was still experiencing bad breakouts.  I even had the really painful acne that are so deep it takes weeks for them to come to the surface!  I continued to use the second shipment of Murad because everything I read said that the purging cycle could take 4 or more weeks.  I spent 3 months and over $60 on this stuff without results.  Silly me, I was going to order more but I started reading reviews for my only alternative, Proactiv.  Now that stuff isn't any cheaper in the long run but someone else mentioned Acne Free in their review and I figured that it was worth a try.  I found it at my local Walreens for $19.  Let me tell you, I used Acne Free for 2, TWO, days and saw results that I had not seen in 3 months of using the expensive stuff.  I can't say enough about it.  I'm thrilled that something so easy to get would work so much better than any hyped up product.  Goes to show, don't buy from T.V.

I bought the Shampoo Theory and Condition Theory and this Redo Freshen-Up Mist. I have normal-type hair that needs to be washed every other day -- and if I use a lot of product, it needs to be washed every day. I have very sensitive skin too. This mist worked very well on my hair, definitely freshened it up and allowed me to restyle it with a quick blow dry. And it feels awesome on my skin. Well done, Jonathan

Well first off, I'm a guy with very short hair...so I don't know whether or not it really works. But I'm bored and decided to rate it anyway. So here goes:

Cons

Conditioner is really thick and difficult to get out of the bottle. The best solution for this is to let the bottle sit upside down. 

Pros

Smells DAMN good. I'm not a big fan of fruity/coconut aromas, but I like this particular smell so much that I might need to go to rehab sometime in the future. 


Bottom Line: Although this conditioner is difficult to get out of the bottle, it smells really good. Whether or not it will work for your hair, the only way to know is to try it. And even if ot doesn't work for your hair...it's worth the 20 bucks just to open it up and smell it every now and then. =)

This is absolutely the greatest shampoo ever! I've been abusing my hair for at least 30 years, and I have never had my hair looking and feeling as healthy as it does now. There is no better product for your hair on the market. All others are full of damaging detergents and chemicals with a dose of silicone thrown in to make you think your hair is clean, but you're killing it. I admire Jonathan for not treating us like idiots by being THE ONLY shampoo that doesn't tell you to lather, shampoo, and rinse twice, but you do need to. And you need to use no more than a dime-size amount of the Jonathan conditioner. My hair has never looked or felt so good

It's the best product I've used to create volume and hold.  I didn't notice it after blow drying, but, while using the curling iron and styling - my hair had a lot more volume and great hold.  I have straight, fine, limp hair and it is very difficult to get it to hold a style.  I truely noticed a big difference.  I plan to purchase the other volumizing products, once they are in stock.

I have tried just about every hair product on the market and this very much surpassed my expectations! I wasn't sure when I put it in my hair, but as I was styling it, I was amazed. It created a lot of volume and my hair stayed shiny. I am ready to try the rest of the product line

This works great on short and long hair and you can use wet or dry. I have long hair and I love using this product. It works great for those evenings after a long day and you want to give your hair new life. Fantastic

I used this product this morning for the first time.  I washed my hair, blew it dry, most of the way, then rubbed the product in my hands and lightly distributed it throughout my hair.  The best way for me to describe it, is that, it is like a creamy hairspray.  Yes, it is tacky, like hairspray can be, but that's how it helps you get the style you want.  What I like about how it works on my hair, is that it really tamed the frizzes and brought down the "big" hair look that I usually have after blowing my thick hair dry.  I think it would also work well on the days that I blow my hair out.  I would probably blow it out first, then apply some dirt to help tame and smooth it.  I can see where it might make thinner, straighter hair a bit limp, so be careful not to use very much.

Edit:  I think it is best to apply to slightly damp hair, that might help with the people that are having trouble applying it to completely dry hair

I have been reading about this miracle hair dryer for months in the beauty magazines I read, so I will admit I was very excited to pruchase it. The results however will amaze even the most cynical consumer. My hair has never looked so good when styled at home. True, it looks about the same as what my hairstylist does, but to me that is well worth the moderately high price tag. It was a good buy for me because I spend a lot of money buying a variety of cremes and glosses to make my hair pretty, and now I know it wasn't the products I put in that made my hair look bad, it was the dryer.I was so surprised to notice that even the ends of my hair were shiny, and my ends are sooo fried. The difference is astounding. 

I bought this dryer in a package with the babyliss straightener, and I would definately recommend that to anyone wanting to buy this dryer. For the same price you can get a free straightener. (A very good one!)

Its good for waking up, because once you put it on you feel refreshed because your lips feel on fire.I like the sting and  the shine of it. It finishes pretty fast and the roll ball may feel like a little drag to keep rolling on the lips, but i think it's worth trying it unless you have extreme sensitive lips, this stuff is strong. Did i mention the great smell? Yum! Me and my boyfriend loved it.

I just got this item (from ebay, it's cheaper)and feel it's worthy of praise.  I have thick, straight hair, and bought this product to wave my hair.  I haven't figured out how it curls, but to wave it's incredibly easy!  Grab your hair from the root and twist outward and it waves nice and fast w/o burning your hair like a curling iron would.  Also w/ a curling iron, it's difficult to wave the top close to the roots.   It heats fast!  and comes w/ a nice pouch so that you can put it away before it cools.

I had the Chi Turbo (1"), but I got worried after reading some reviews about it being unreliable.  So part of the reason I wanted to buy the T3 iron was that it comes with a 4-YEAR comprehensive warranty.  The other difference is that the solid-ceramic plates are "infused" with tourmaline which I found intriguing.

1-3/8" wide plates are the perfect width for my long-ish hair.  (I've used a 2 inch wide iron, which I found harder to maneuver.)  It heats up fast, and stays hot.  It does a great job gripping the hair without snagging.  My hair stays silky and straight all day, and does not feel damaged after a while, like it did with cheaper irons I've used in the past.

Another thing that this iron does that other irons do not do as well - it really curls.  It has heat vents along the sides of the plates that lets you curl your hair by twisting it near the root and pulling it through (different from the usual method of gripping the ends of the strands and then winding up).  It creates a springy curl better than any flat iron I've used.  (However, the heating vents make the exterior of the iron hotter to the touch.  So there is a drawback to this function.)

Overall, I enjoy using this flat iron.  Very happy with this purchase.

ETA: I've learned that HairArt will not honor the warranty unless you buy it from an authorized distributor (e.g., Sephora). So you might want to check that before you place your order

After watching Blow Out and seeing how passionate Jonathan was about his product, he sold me. Anyone who is that determined to make the best product on the market, obviously will do whatever it takes to make it happen.
After seeing how much the product was, I cringed at the fact that a bottle of shampoo would be that much. I later, literally dragged myself to Sephora to purchase this shampoo/conditioner after knowing that I was willing to take a risk that could eventually end up in my closet.
I bought it, went straight to my bathroom, and washed my hair. The shampoo did not lather, which I expected considering there is no harsh detergents or sodium lauryl sulfate. The conditioner was a very light, thin substance. Definitely not thick. 
Finale-Dried my hair, and right there, I knew that this product is definitely the BEST hair product BY FAR, that I have ever used. My hair, is very damaged, brittle and FULL of split ends. This product made my hair, very very full, FULL of shine, and very soft. My hair was beautiful for days....
Last test.. going to work. As soon as I put my hair down from a pony tail (I'm a waitress), INSTANTLY everyone noticed my hair. They asked "what did you do?? your hair is soo beautiful".. I told them "40 dollar shampoo and conditioner" WELL WORTH THE COST. Definitely a salon in a bottle. Now my worst fear is that it will be discontinued for any reason. And if so, I am willing spend 1k to stock up and save as much as I can. There is no other product like it

After reading the other reviews I was a little worried about using the product I had already ordered.  After using it for a few days now my hair has never looked better, I truly feel like this shampoo/conditioner was meant for me.  I have fine, super straight hair, middle to short.  It feels clean and sleek. The conditioner smells like pina coloda, yum!  I would definatly recommend this for my hair type.  Would maybe recommend to lather the shampoo in your hands first then work thoroughly( it doesn't lather as well as some shampoos that have lots of glycerine in them) and only apply the conditioner towards the end of your hair and leave in for a few min.  Hope that helps

I thought I was just going to have to put up with fly-away hair the rest of my life.  This product is not for baby fine hair that goes limp when anything touches it.  It's serious taming for seriously stubborn, coarse, or frizzy hair.  Mine falls into the first two categories.  Don't use too much!  I use it after I've dried some of the moisture out with light blow drying then gently sweep it through my hair - even combing it gently in to reach every strand.  For the first time in years my razor-cut layered hair is smooth

LIKE ANY OTHER LEAVE-in creme, conditioner, ANYTHING, if you PUT TOO MUCH OF IT ON, it WILL attract  DIRT.  I know this because I have baby fine hair and had to model in the DRY DRY deserts in the middle of summer.  Needed ANYTHING leave-in to keep my staticy hair down.  Yes, the more you use, to more dirty you get....  (but in photos you can't really see this, but it felt nasty!)    SO.  Wash your hair.   Well.  Condition.  Towel dry.  APPLY SPARINGLY.  Like a TOUCH.  And smooth into hair. It's not rocket science.  If you need a little more later, add a little more

High Beam is a nice subtle highlighter. However, be sure to blend it very quickly and well or it will look unnatural in certain lighting (it'll look like you have pink nail polish on your face). It also has a tendency to emphasize pores. So only use it on areas of your face where you don't have any, like on the top of the cheek bone and under your eyebrows.

This dry iron is absolutely amazing, I really can't say enough about it. Great for ALL TYPES of hair! It heats up in just seconds and what would take almost 2hrs to blow dry my hair now takes less than half the time. Plus your hair comes out extremely straight. Highly recommend to anyone who wants their hair to look great but doesnt have the time or energy to sit in a hair salon for hours. It is an investment in your hair, one of the better ones I've made.

I don't know what the complaints about this product are.  It seems that people are trying to use it for extreme hold hairstyles.  This is not the purpose of this product.  I use it for my short haircut to make the ends stay spiky and styled out, and it works WONDERFULLY.  No matter how much you move your head, it stays in place, but somehow moves enough to keep you from having a stiff look.  And, when you brush your hair out at the end of the day, it feels like you never put it in.  Hair stays soft and feels clean.  The reason why this gel is thinner is that it isn't as sticky or goopey in your hair as other gels.  And it spreads out easier

I purchased a Beauty Water Shower Purification System and have used it about 5 times now with fantastic results. I have very hard water in my home and am tired of constantly having to blow dry my hair or having to use tons of products for it to be manageable and not frizzy.  My hair felt very soft and manageable using this product and I am hoping it helps my highlights last longer.  I did not experience that 'slimy' feeling people usually associate with soft water.  I'm even able to let my hair air dry and not be frizzy with this product.  I am curious to see how long this filter lasts.  I called Jonathan Products and was told that they do have a replacement filter that costs $55 so you can save a bit of money when you need to replace the filter

I watched Blow Out and figured the product was flying off the shelves because of the show's popularity.  I ordered some because the ingredients sounded nice, plus he did seem sincere when formulating, etc.  I have blonde hair, color treated, thick, long lengths.  I've bought high-end hair products for 20 yrs from beauty salons and stores and have never used anything that made my hair feel like Jonathan Product.  You can immediately tell it's stripping and cleansing your hair.  Then, the conditioner,  with it's exotic fragrance,  is the most wonderful conditioning treatment I've ever used.  My hair looks cleaner and has more body than ever before with just shampoo &amp; conditioner.  I'll use it as long as it's available to me

This brush holds the hair in pace when blowing dry and also lets you move it with your hair and dose not hurt as some can or get stuck. You will not be sorry if you are looking for the perfect brush to go with your perfect dryer (the featherweight)! Oh another thing I like is it extremely easy to keep clean.

Its good for waking up, because once you put it on you feel refreshed because your lips feel on fire.I like the sting and  the shine of it. It finishes pretty fast and the roll ball may feel like a little drag to keep rolling on the lips, but i think it's worth trying it unless you have extreme sensitive lips, this stuff is strong. Did i mention the great smell? Yum! Me and my boyfriend loved it.

As a lip gloss addict, I have easily over 200+ glosses. Too Faced Fat Kiss is by far one of my favorites. The superb shine makes my lips look so good! Although it doesn't really plump, it still tastes like cinnamon, and it will warm you up in winter. I have two different colors, because I like it so much! I strongly reccomend getting a couple, so you can keep them in your purse, make up bag, car...Everywhere! This rocks sooo much

Well I am very impressed with this.  I also have tried so many different shampoos and this is one of the best, if not the best, I've used.  I say that because whether I straighten my hair or leave it curly, this shampoo makes it feel and look and smell great.  It feels so nice and clean.  I don't rinse twice with this because it's unnessesary.  
I tried this because of watching Blow Out and on my last trip to America I bought a couple of bottles.  It's one of the best purchases I made.  Most girls buy shampoos etc based on packaging and smell and let me tell you, not only does it look and smell great, but what it does for your hair is amazing and apparently it's very low in damaging chemicals.  I won't hesitate to buy more of Jonathan's products next time I go.  I love this and can't say enough about it

This is the second product of Jonathan's I've used and I'm equally happy with it.  I have thin hair when it's straight, and something in the middle when it's curly.  Either way, I'd like it thicker, and this foam certainly helps.  It's great and I've found it does what it promises.  It smells good and you don't need to use too much.  It feels nice in my hair and the fragrance lasts most of the day.  It doesn't matter if your hair is curly or straight, hopefully you will find this as effective and as helpful as I have

I just got this item (from ebay, it's cheaper)and feel it's worthy of praise.  I have thick, straight hair, and bought this product to wave my hair.  I haven't figured out how it curls, but to wave it's incredibly easy!  Grab your hair from the root and twist outward and it waves nice and fast w/o burning your hair like a curling iron would.  Also w/ a curling iron, it's difficult to wave the top close to the roots.   It heats fast!  and comes w/ a nice pouch so that you can put it away before it cools.

I had the Chi Turbo (1"), but I got worried after reading some reviews about it being unreliable.  So part of the reason I wanted to buy the T3 iron was that it comes with a 4-YEAR comprehensive warranty.  The other difference is that the solid-ceramic plates are "infused" with tourmaline which I found intriguing.

1-3/8" wide plates are the perfect width for my long-ish hair.  (I've used a 2 inch wide iron, which I found harder to maneuver.)  It heats up fast, and stays hot.  It does a great job gripping the hair without snagging.  My hair stays silky and straight all day, and does not feel damaged after a while, like it did with cheaper irons I've used in the past.

Another thing that this iron does that other irons do not do as well - it really curls.  It has heat vents along the sides of the plates that lets you curl your hair by twisting it near the root and pulling it through (different from the usual method of gripping the ends of the strands and then winding up).  It creates a springy curl better than any flat iron I've used.  (However, the heating vents make the exterior of the iron hotter to the touch.  So there is a drawback to this function.)

Overall, I enjoy using this flat iron.  Very happy with this purchase.

ETA: I've learned that HairArt will not honor the warranty unless you buy it from an authorized distributor (e.g., Sephora). So you might want to check that before you place your order

I have been using the volumizing shampoo and conditioner for 2 weeks.  I love this product!  No build up, No dandruf.  Make sure your hair is wet, not just damp, and you should not have a "lathering problem".  I purchased this from QVC and I will definately be a repeat customer.  I have short hair, so this will last me a while.  I loved it so much I bought some for my daughter.  This is my new shampoo

I love the Benefit line, everything I have tried works great (not to mention they have great packaging and catchy names for all their products!). 

That said, High Beam is simply amazing. It only takes a little dab to add a nice glow/shimmer to my face. I especially like to use it on the cheek bones as it leaves a nice soft glow. High Beam works so much better for me than other products I've tried that either left my skin sticky or chalky. Not to mention those other products cost a lot more!

If you are looking for a little glow, a little shimmer, High Beam is the answer

I recently discovered Benefit products. This is a great product if you want to add a little glow to your skin. I use it to highlight my cheek bones. You can use it any where you want a glance to linger. The best thing about this product is the smallest amount makes a big difference in your skin. I suggest you try this product. It works wonders.

This dry iron is absolutely amazing, I really can't say enough about it. Great for ALL TYPES of hair! It heats up in just seconds and what would take almost 2hrs to blow dry my hair now takes less than half the time. Plus your hair comes out extremely straight. Highly recommend to anyone who wants their hair to look great but doesnt have the time or energy to sit in a hair salon for hours. It is an investment in your hair, one of the better ones I've made.

I am a big fan of this product.  My hair is very strong.  It needs a product which can keep it tamed.  However, most products that have that level of strength also come with high sheen or gloss which, in my opinion, is a bad look for today's fashions.  The matte look is more flexible.  American Crew Fiber gives me pliability and a matte look with a very strong hold.  It also smells nice.... not to strong and not too girly

I have been using this product for over 5 years as an alternative to gel or bed head.  The results are great. No unwated shine, no gooiness, very easy to wash off. 
Your hair wont feel stiff and wont get damaged. Reasonably priced and more available every day.

This is a great product for getting the bed head look.  I can use approximately a dime size worth in my palms and go wild!  Trust me, the results are great.  If you apply too much, you're hair will get oily. The good thing is that this product washes out easily with any Shampoo

This stuff is great.  I used to buy new gels, pommades, pastes, etc. every month because I could never find one that worked exactly how I wanted it to.  But I first tried this a year ago and it's all I've used since.  And it lasts a long time, so don't be afraid of the price.  One container lasts me about 6 months, so you only have to buy it twice a year.  I'll be ordering my third order of it soon

I just had my fine, processed hair cut into a short layered wedge.  It was shoulder length before and I used a Revlon thermal-air styler to make it acceptable.  After using Dirt, I no longer have to spend ANY time styling it!!  I just blow dry, scrunching my hair with my fingers and when almost dry, I turn my head upside-down and apply about a dime size amount of Dirt into the roots. Flip up and I'm ready to go all in less than 3 minutes.  I find it important to rub Dirt between my palms to warm it up before applying.  Use a little first...you can always add more. It gave my hair great body and control. Hope this product works for you too

I have long, thick, wavy hair that loves to frizz up.  I have tried every anti-frizz, hairstyling product out there, and they either didn't work or weighed my hair down.  I didn't want to like this hair dryer and was hoping it wouldn't live up to the hype... BUT, it's excellent on my hair.  After using the dryer (with no styling product) my hair was straight, shiny and felt great.  For me, it didn't change the amount of time I dried my hair, so if your considering buying it for speed, don't, unless you have thin or short hair.  Is it worth the $200.00 price tag?  Depends on you personally, but I recommend you shop around because there are better deals out there

I have been reading about this miracle hair dryer for months in the beauty magazines I read, so I will admit I was very excited to pruchase it. The results however will amaze even the most cynical consumer. My hair has never looked so good when styled at home. True, it looks about the same as what my hairstylist does, but to me that is well worth the moderately high price tag. It was a good buy for me because I spend a lot of money buying a variety of cremes and glosses to make my hair pretty, and now I know it wasn't the products I put in that made my hair look bad, it was the dryer.I was so surprised to notice that even the ends of my hair were shiny, and my ends are sooo fried. The difference is astounding. 

I bought this dryer in a package with the babyliss straightener, and I would definately recommend that to anyone wanting to buy this dryer. For the same price you can get a free straightener. (A very good one!)

I had stopped using a regular hair dryer a few of months ago as I felt that my hair was becoming brittle and looking damaged.  However air drying my hair seemed to take forever. It was then that I heard about the T3 tourmaline Professional Ionic Hair Dryer from my hairdresser.  Initially the $200 price tag did put me off and I pushed the idea aside. But somehow it remained somewhere in the corner of my mind and one fine day after getting late for a meeting yet again, I decided to bite the bullet and buy the hairdryer. 

And I tell you, I have never been happier using a hair dryer. My hair started looking better and less damaged in the first few weeks itself. It has become smooth and silky and has a healthy glow.  Though the weight and the time taken were almost similar to my old model, the after effect is worth the price paid. The product does come with a 4-year warranty which is an added advantage to justify the exorbitant price. Though the sales brochures uses a lot of scientific terms like ionic mineral and blah... blah... I am not going to bother about it much as far as my hair appears healthy and saves me time so that I don't have to deal with being late for meetings. I   recommend this product to all who would love to have a mane to be proud of

This is a great idea for a product! For those of you who don't wash your hair every day, this is a great way to keep it looking and smelling fresh on days you don't wash it. I used this after 5 days without washing, and while it might have worked better within 3 or 4 days, it still freshened my hair and made it beautiful! Well done

I bought the Shampoo Theory and Condition Theory and this Redo Freshen-Up Mist. I have normal-type hair that needs to be washed every other day -- and if I use a lot of product, it needs to be washed every day. I have very sensitive skin too. This mist worked very well on my hair, definitely freshened it up and allowed me to restyle it with a quick blow dry. And it feels awesome on my skin. Well done, Jonathan

I don't know what the complaints about this product are.  It seems that people are trying to use it for extreme hold hairstyles.  This is not the purpose of this product.  I use it for my short haircut to make the ends stay spiky and styled out, and it works WONDERFULLY.  No matter how much you move your head, it stays in place, but somehow moves enough to keep you from having a stiff look.  And, when you brush your hair out at the end of the day, it feels like you never put it in.  Hair stays soft and feels clean.  The reason why this gel is thinner is that it isn't as sticky or goopey in your hair as other gels.  And it spreads out easier

I got a sample of this conditioner when I bought a similar product by another company.  I didn't care for the one I purchased, but the sample was awesome and I am going to buy the Jonathan conditioner.  I have always had fine limp hair and tried lots of volume products.  I used this for a week and this is the only thing I have ever seen any kind of difference with.  I love it!

Its effect very much depends on the climate you live in. If you live in a colder and dry climate, especially during winter it does exactly as it promises - great moisturizer, lines are diminished, as is puffiness. I really love using it - I am 35 and currently living in a cold and dry climate. But in hot and sometims humid climates, or during summer it just doesn't work as well - I don't know why. I like it a lot and this is my 3rd bottle, although I am using it as a seasonal eye care

I never wanted to waste my money on a manicure, because my polish would be chipping/peeling by the next day.  My pedicurist bet me that she could keep the polish on my manicure by using this stuff, and low and behold...it worked!  It kept the polish on for a week even through housecleaning and a trip to Vegas

Cold weather will be with us for a while and nothing makes one feel warmer than being wrapped in a delicious flowery fragrance - that certainly is Chanel No. 22. It's a blend of white flowers that has resulted in a scent which is both sweetly innocent and sensuous. 

Continuing in their use of symbolism and numbers after the overwhelming success of Chanel No. 5, Coco Chanel and Ernest Beaux developed yet another fragrance, naming it No. 22 for the year it was presented. 

It may have been created in 1922 but it's as up to the minute as tomorrow, especially in the new spray.

The Still Life bath bomb contains pretty sunflower petals that make this a summery bath experience. To be truthful, after putting this in the bath I walked away and came back into the room, wondering who was eating Fruit Loops! That is the scent of this "fun to take a bath before breakfast" experience. 

The fresh scent of Lemon and Sweet Wild Orange mingles with Bergamot and Gardenia extract. The result of this bath is a refreshing - I can face the day feeling. If you want to enhance the experience, try the Happy Hippy shower gel with grapefruit. The I Love Juicy Shampoo and Veganese Conditioner also complete the citrus experience. 

If you think the petals in this bath bombs are fun (the ones in my bath slipped right down the drain), wait until you try the Big Blue experience with seaweed. It does take an adventurous spirit to try some of these items, but as an official LUSH addict, I tend to dive into the experiences with abandon. You may also love Golden Slumbers (lavender and Neroli), Sex Bomb (Jasmine, Ylang Ylang, Clary Sage), Romance In A Stone (Wild Orange, Mandarin &amp; Tangarine). 

Onward to try Tisty Toasty which I hear is a bit of a 
love spell style bath with rose petals.

i've been wearing makeup to some degree or another for over 30 years, and i've never, ever found foundation as good, pure, non-irritating, glow-y or simply as PERFECT as bare minerals.  i truly believe it CLEARED UP my adult acne within a month that i started using it.  i just ordered this kit and i'm confident it will perform as well as the other products i have by this company.  don't waste your $$ on the imitators- everyone's jumped on the mineral makeup bandwagon now, but this original line is hands-down the best

i've gotten a few compliments on it...by my advice to the ladies who want to buy perfume via online...buy the smaller bottles first to see if you really like the scent...moreso than the big bottles.  i bought the $50 one and i do like it, but i think it's gonna take me awhile to finish it...so from now on, i'll buy the 1.7 oz. first and then buy the bigger bottles if i like the scent.  but overall, very fresh and sweet smelling..

Obviously some people don't care about reviewing an item, just about bashing a pop artist that doesn't deserve it.

Anyway, I think it smells great.  Obviously it does, or it wouldn't be the bestselling perfume right now.  But don't take my word for it, go to your nearest store and give it a sniff.  Also be sure to check out Fantasy, I think it smells even better

I have to agree with the previous reviewer when I say that possibly this IS "one for the ladies". But only in a good way! I first encountered this scent walking past the fragrance counter at the mall many years ago. At the time, it seemed that all the fragrances for men were heavy musks, orientals, spices, etc. This was...er...fruity. (I see you cringing!) It's lemony. Like a puff of lemon cake. A breeze over a lemon field in Tuscany. (are there fields of lemons in Tuscany? I don't know, but it's a mental pic, go with it!) A spritz of cologne following a bit of aftershave balm is a sure recipe to get yourself sniffed and cuddled. It doesn't bash you over the head with macho tones- it lures with tingling tartness. I have yet to meet a woman who dislikes the scent. And yes, I do steal it from my husband sometimes! On him (a light eyed blond) it stays true to the bottle scent, but on me (brunette with oily skin) it morphs to something with vanilla notes in the lemon. I think it's a great "safe" gift for people who aren't sure what cologne to buy for a new male friend.
I gave it four stars, because the cologne does need to be reapplied frequently to maintain a viable scent. The fragrance lasts for approximately four hours. But if you can't get noticed for your lemony deliciousness in four hours, you have more problems than a cologne will fix. (brush your teeth!) LAUGH!! :

I've tried all types of eyeliner, and they all end up smudging or flaking off, very messy by the end of a long day (or night).  I bought this one to wear at my wedding (in the fantastic chocolate shade) and it was absolutely perfect!  Well worth the price.  Great wear, easy to apply (with a very skinny-tipped brush, I ended up using a tiny paintbrush)and stays exactly where you put it

I was very pleased with this purchase. The perfume arrived packaged nicely and was actually bigger than I expected 1 oz. to be.  I love the scent and will definately buy more when this one is gone!  Great experience with Amazon

I have always loved happy, but I love my happy heart!  I wear it 99% of the time.  My guy loves the smell too...and I often get comments that it smells wonderful.  Not too strong, just enough.  :)  I'd recommend this perfume to everyone, young and old.

This is probably one to keep away from the kids. It smells good enough to eat and its frothy, whipped consistency makes it even more tempting! It's a bit pricey, but it lathers up really well. I found that about a teaspoon full on my loofah was more than enough for my shower. And it just smells amazing! Very refreshing and a definite mood-lifter. Now I want to try the Whipped Body Delight in this scent

The flavor and scent are great! I continue to smell the "sugar" scent for a while after applying, and it lasts on my lips for a long time. It's a nice, shiny look but doesn't go overboard

I love the idea that this is an all natural mascara + has organic ingredients but nothing artifical or chemicals!!  This is the tipe of mascara which lengthens the lashes not volumises it (I think Dr. Hauschka doesn't make that kind). When it's time to wash it off it comes off very easy (spares your lashes).

Unfortunately I couldn't change my 4 star recommendation to 2...and this is a follow up on my previous review. 
When I'd been using this mascara for about 2 weeks I noticed that it started to flake except for some reason the flakes ended up in my eyes, not on my cheek or under my eyes. First I didn't know it was the mascara..I thought something went into my eyes but every single time I applied, it happened. Not straight away..but in about 2-3 hours later..This was very frustrating...I tried to put less of this product on my lashes but then I looked like I had nothing on. At this point I still had some flaking, not as bad as before, but it was still enough to hurt my eyes..so I just stopped using this product all together.
The only reason why I'd give 2 stars for this product instead of 1 because it's natural and organic...and I appriciate that fact. But that's about it.
I really wanted to like this product so I am very disappointed, it wasn't cheap either. Dr. Hauschka need to improve the quality of this product

I read many positive (and very few negative) reviews before I ordered my first tube.  I am 65 living in Florida and  have been using it once daily on face and back of hands for about 4 months.  The cream goes on smoothly, and I have had no negative reaction.  Friends tell me that my face is noticeably younger looking, with less wrinkles.  In fact two friends, based on my favorable experience, are also planning to purchase Kinerase

Foams nicely in the tub, rinses away cleanly.  Skin isn't left with any film.  Instead, your skin is left very soft and with a good scent.  Falling in love smells sweet and relaxing, and makes me think of cotton candy.  The large bottle lasts quite a while as a bath gel but goes considerably quicker if you choose to use it as a shower gel.  Recommend you use it with a loofah in the shower

I must say that I have been really impressed with this product. I tend to have skin that is combo/oily, which results in occasional pimples here and there. Not really acne, but annoying blackheads and bumps. I had been using something else similar to this with ok results. However, within just 2 days of beginning this, I noticed immediate results. My breakouts have been a non-event, and even if I get a pimple here or there, it's gone in a day. I've even noticed a drastic improvement in those hard-to-eliminate blackheads. My skin feels much smoother and my pores look better. I don't see how I could ever be without this

This is the only blemish treatment that I have ever tried that will get rid of anything. Ive been using it for 8 years and it has never let me down. 
You can use it as a spot treatment or if you have an area of clogged pores on your nose you can put a little on every night to help clear those up.
It isnt meant to go on the places of your face where you have no acne or blemishes though. It is strong and can cause a little peeling if you put it on your entire face.
It's a little pricey, but the size of this container will probably last you close to a year

This powder is great. It has great coverage without looking cakey. I also have sensitive skin and this has never bothered me. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's still a little dark for very light skin and it needs to be "touched-up" a little more often than other powders I've tried, but it's worth it

This being my first badger brush, I don't know how competent a reviewer I can be, but i am really happy with it. It is large enough to hold a lot of foam (sometimes i fell like it actually holds too much). It is fairly heavy and robust, which i also like.
I've been using it for about 6 months now, and have a feeling that it is going to last for years.
Make sure to hang it to dry and wash it thoroughly after each use.
For anybody who is new to the wonderful world of shaving with a brush, i highly recommend this page as a intro: [...]

I have been using StriVectin SD eye cream for one month. I am 30 and have no wrinkles but some uneven skin tone, so I cannot comment on wrinkle restoration - my goal is prevention. However, I have a small unsightly broken blood vessel underneath one eye that I have had for 10 years. Applying StriVectin 2x per day has diminished the appearance significantly in just 4 weeks. I am of course hopeful that it will disappear  completely with continued use. I never expected that the broken blood vessel could be treated topically and I was thinking of having a laser treatment (a bit scary though near the eye!). I am thrilled with the cream and will stick with it.

       Laura Mercier cosmetics are a bit like bon-bons - you can't have just one.  She makes it easy for us with her Eye Color Duos - 2 compatible eye shadow colors in one mirrored compact.

	While there are five appealing color combinations, all fresh and sheer, my current favorites are Moss and Azure.  With two colors, one light and one dark, I have a veritable palette of possibilities.  Each can be used alone or together with one shading under the brow and the other on the lid.  Or, the colors can be mixed for a completely different effect.

	Colors are intensified by a second or third application.  (A sponge tipped swab is very effective for this.)

	Merci, Mercier!

I can't even begin to explain how much I love this product.   Although teen age acne is long gone for me, like most women at that certain time of the month, I get a little flair up here and there.   This product is great.   Totally takes the red out and I say speeds the healing process as well.  I found it it made them disappear over night if I dabbed it on there a few times a day and esp when I saw the begingings of one.   Ones I caught early on never really turned into full blown acne.  Yes it's pricey but I think it's worth every penny.

 If you are like me and get the occasional zit when you least expect it, then this works out well. It will not remove the zit, but it will cover the nasty monster pretty well!! I put it under my lancome powder and it really made a difference. Because it is clear it will blend in with whatever foundation or powder you use. oH YES and it covers all the redness that comes with those nasty zits. A girls new best friend :

If you're like me, you get the occasional zit at the most inopportune time. BeneFit's Boo Boo Zap! is a bit spendy for such a small amount (about the size of a small tube of lipstick) but it does help. While it won't erase the zit overnight, it will get the red out. You can dab some on under or over makeup too because it goes on clear, not tinted. Definitely worth a try

I used this product in the evening and noticed immediate plumping. I also use LipFusion XL (50.00)- but sometimes the results are not long-lasting. When I used the Too-Faced Lip Injection Mask- the results were immediate, and seemed to continue for hours. When I woke in the morning- my lips were very plumped- much more so than with Lip Fusion Alone. I will use these products together- the Lip Injection Mask from Too-Faced is amazing! Used first, then with Lip Fusion XL layered on top after rinsing off the mask- it seriously looked like I had undergone medical-procedure lip-plumping! I highly reccommend this Lip Injection Mask.

I am 51 and recently visited an upscale retail store in Manhattan.  The Yves St Laurent gal behind the cosmetic counter noticed my complexion was a little sallow - put this product about an inch on each side of my nose and blended it in..what a difference it made...a worthwhile investment..I use it under my eyes and just about all over my face for a nice touch-up, concealer and brightener..covers freckles and sun spots, too

Awesome product - best concealer I've ever used.  It is lightweight and does not settle into the under eye "creases" that my almost 50-year-old eyes have.  The pink undertone brightens and lightens.

I've used Paris Hilton perfume for about a year now.  Ordering it online at Amazon was terrific.  I didn't have to drive, and the price is half the amount you would spend in the department store!!!
If you haven't tried this fragrance, please do so.  You will be wonderfully surprised at how special it makes you feel!

This Paris Hilton perfume is wonderful. I got it 2 months ago in September as one of my birthday presents from my mum. I'd heard of the Paris Hilton perfume a while back but I thought it wouldn't be that good however a few days before my birthday my mum brought home a tester and I was really shocked. The perfume smells delicous, every time I have it on I get tons of compliments. It really is a gorgeous scent perfect for night and day. I have had a lot of perfumes in my life, some of them really expensive but this is by far the best ever. I would recommend this to anyone

This product will not work for everyone. It's not really for people with straight, fine hair.  It's formulated to target mostly women of color who have tightly curled, thick, natural hair.  I apply about a nickle-size of this stuff to the ends of my hair before I style it. It leaves my hair soft, manageable, and conditioned - eliminating breakage so that it can grow long and healthy. The aroma is a little too earthy for my personal taste, but I can handle that as long as the natural ingredients work. I give it 5 stars

I love this product.  It has healed my brittle hair after being bleached one too many times.  I use it every day and it not only heals and conditions my hair but it holds my style in place.  

As some people mentioned, it can make your hair greasy.  You have to make sure to massage it into your hair and only use a little.

I liked this product so much-I'm buying some for my family members who live out of town!  Only a small amount leaves my hair feeling soft, shiny and moisturized.  And it's great on my ends-especially with roller sets! Plus, my darling hubby loves the scent. I use it along with the Khoret Amen Hair Oil

I have tried many face cleaners, Murad Acne Clarifying Cleanser and it is great. Murad Acne Clarifying Cleanser has a nice scent and leaves my face feeling tingly clean without dry it out. Murad Acne Clarifying Cleanser helps control my acne and I would recommend Murad to anyone who needs help with acne.

I know it sounds cliche, but I have literally tried every acne product both over the counter and prescription. Such products include (but are not limited to) Proactiv, Exposed Skin Care, Differin, Accutane, Neutrogena products, Clean and Clear, etc. I have never had results like this. I previously tried the Murad Acne Complex and found it to be a little too harsh for my red, irritated, sensitive skin. I currently switched to the sensitive line for the Murad Acne Complex which consists of this cleanser, Moisturizing Acne Treatment Gel and the Cellular Replenishing Serum. I have found that my cistic acne is gone, the blotchiness is reduced and the number of whiteheads has drastically reduced. My skin has never looked so smooth in all my pre-teen and young adult life and I have only been using this particular line for 4 days! In addition to the sensitive Acne complex, I would also recommend getting the Clarifying Toner. And remember, a little goes a long way with these products!

I recently became a fan of Body Shop products and am only sorry that I didn't try them sooner.  Their products are all, without fail, of superior quality.  The Satsuma line especially is wonderful, and is my favorite scent from the Body Shop.  It is the juicy fresh smell of tangerines/oranges.  I have read some reviews that it reminds people of a creamsicle type scent but I completely disagree with that. I have never liked creamsicle scents and I love Satsuma.  It is not cloying or too sweet.  It is a very pure scent and I always feel clean and beautiful while wearing it.  One other thing to note about this product...  I do not always like perfume oils because the scent is not always accurate when compared to other products in the same line.  I am not sure if this is because sometimes the oils are so concentrated that they smell like "too much".  The Satsuma oil is not like that at all - it smells true to the rest of the line.  The scent also lasts for a long time after being applied, due to the fact that it is a perfume oil.  A little goes a long way - I would not be surprised if the bottle lasted for over a year.  I love this product and give it my highest recommendation.

This is currently my absolute favorite scent. I get so discouraged when smell somthing in a store love it, buy it, take it home and put it on, and smells completely different on me. I have never had that problem with this scent. it's smells delicious in the bottle and on the skin, that is if you like citrus. It smells like a fresh, ripe Orange, with the slightest hint of spice. The man in my life finds it quite cuddle worthy. If you are not familiar with perfume oils, just somthing to note. they are highly concentrated, a little goes a long way. it also phases nicely, from intense to pleasently subtle and is long lasting. Another bonus is that there are only few ingredients, so it's less likely to irritate sensitive skin. One bottle will last and last, there is a flexable applicator wand inside the lid. I really can't say enough about this wonderful fragrance

My significate other bought the shampoo for me, I use the hair butter and various other products from Carol's Daughter.  I was very fortune to actually make it to the store in New York. I have very short barber-style hair and the scent drives people wild. I will continue to buy these products; if you like the fruity-tuttie smells and your hair grease non petroleum based, Carol's Daughter is for you

This is an excellent product but I have a problem disguising the white look it leaves on my face. At first I thought it was because I used too much, but even when I use only a tiny amount it is still white.

It will certainly suit persons with pale complexions. Wish there was a tint to it

This stuff is wonderful!  I still use a moisturizer w/ SPF 15, but why settle for SPF 15 when you can get SPF 40?  This is not a creamy sunscreen that makes your skin feel all oily and like it can't breathe, instead it's more on the liquid side and you just quickly rub it in, then you can go ahead and put your regular moisturizer and makeup over it.  It's lovely and light and you can wear it every day.  It's the only sunscreen I have found that has enough SPF coverage for my sensitive pale skin but isn't thick enough to clog up my pores and cause breakouts. It may seem expensive, but not only is the quality of the product worth it, but you only need a small amount.  I wear it during the spring and the summer, and after a year I'm still working on the same bottle.  I wasn't sure if it was going to be effective (not being from a brand that you usually associate with rugged outdoor activity), but after a week by the beach, I was the only one who's face wasn't burned all red, even though everyone else had been wearing Coppertone and Bullfrog facial sunscreen

I absolutely love this scent. I originally got the perfume and the 3 in 1 as a gift set and loved it so much I bought the lotion. The scent is a very light sort of cotton candy smell. I have a huge sweet tooth and just love the sweet smells. If you like cotton candy or a sugary smell then you'll love this

When I first tried this perfume, it reminded very much of Victoria's Secret Pink--it had that same distinctly sweet, strongly scented unique floral note, yet here the bouquet was significantly softer, sweeter.  It would work well for someone who likes a sweet, girly scent that is light yet still pronounced.  The one drawback is that the staying power is poor:  I couldn't detect any trait of this just a few hours later.  This is a bit disappointing give the high price, yet this still might be a good choice for someone who is looking for an everyday fragrance and doesn't mind having to reapply

I absolutely fell in love with this fragrance.  It smells like a day at the County Fair, absolutely lovely.  You have to layer it though to make it last.. wash with the shower gel, put on the body lotion first thing when you get out of the shower or bath, (perfumes "stick" better that way, while you're "moist"), and then spray.  If you wash your hair, spray while your blow-drying it out.  Carry the spray in your purse, you will need to "touch up" during the day

I was afraid of this fragrance in the bottle, since it smelled like carmelized sugar to me. I tried the shower gel first, loved it, had to try the perfume.  Everyone loves it! My friend even asked if she could copy me and wear it too! Of course I said yes, everyone needs a little love!  We both agree to spritz a little extra on if you want others to smell it, it goes on very light. An extra spritz is not obnoxious with this scent

This scent is truly intoxicating.  I have tried various perfumes like Arpege, Evelyn Rose and J'adore but there was always something missing.  Flower by Kenzo is by far the most satisfying fragrance.  It has the Elegance of Arpege,
Sensuality of Evelyn Rose and Classiness of J'adore.  This product-line also have matching Deoderant so not to clash with the perfume. How nice is that! It is not too strong either but lasts for a long time. I have at last found my favorite scent that makes me feel really good

My hair tends to fall out due to me not eating enough protein, so NEW! (Hair) is a lifesaver.  As others have said, it lathers like you wouldn't believe -- you really only need to roll it in your hands two or three times to get enough for a thick lather -- and it has an amazing scent.  (Sniffing the bar can actually be a bit addictive...you can smell it really strongly even before you open the box!)  I've found that keeping it in a small lightly covered dish in my bedroom, away from the moisture of the bathroom, is the best way to preserve it for a while.  (Also, it works as an accidental room freshener -- seriously, the smell is incredible!)

My only wish is that the scent would last a little longer in my hair, since it doesn't really stick, even right after showering, unless I use a lot of lather, and that ends up being expensive since then the bar doesn't last as long.  Most of the time, there isn't even much of a hint, whereas other Lush shampoos can make your hair smell wonderful, even a bit overpowering, for days.

Also, unlike some of the other Lush products, it leaves my hair fairly flat.  It's true that it helps with making hair really soft and shiny, but it seems to have the opposite effect when it comes to volume, and that's not so good when you're already having some hair loss.  Using a mostly scent-free conditioner after is almsot necessary, at least in my experience.

I think NEW! (Hair) is a terrific shampoo for its hair-restoring qualities and general sniffability, but at the same time, it could be a little better with its more cosmetic qualities.  Buy it more for the former than the latter if you want the most enjoyment and value out of it.  And if you do have hair loss, trust me -- the price is worth it

My title says it all. This smells so amazing, and is such a lush and fabulous lather, that I will never wash with any other soap again. I even bought the perfume because I found myself sniffing my arms all day long after a shower. 

It's fantastic, it's totally worth the money, and it lasts a long time. One bottle lasts me 2-3 months, bathing every day. I've even used this in my hair before... but it tends to dry out my hair a lot and I need a lot of moisture because I have blonded curly hair.

The Kerastase line is hard to find (used to be only sold in Kerastase salons, I believe.) The shampoos do EXACTLY what they say. In this case, this is a moisturizing shampoo for dried hair that may be overly chemically treated. I only wish they came in larger bottles

Since I was in high school, so many women have praised the wonders of Almost Lipstick in Black Honey.  I finally self-gifted and purchased for myself, and all of my expectations have been met.  The color is initially scary in the tube, but at the very least swipe it on your hand - you'll see that it is actually a very wearable sheer brownish raspberry color.  You can layer it for a stronger color, or swipe it over lip balm to make it even more sheer.  The resulting effect is your lips, but better.  The color of your lips is improved and they are moist and shiny looking.  If you layer repeatedly over dry lips it is a very shiny deep red brown color.  I've seen Black Honey worn by fair/medium Asian and White women and has looked flattering on every one of them.  Lastly, the product does not smell.  It has no perfumes that become disgusting as the day wears on, nor does it have that cheap waxy smell/taste.  A fabulous product

I have: long, thick, fine hair that is naturally wavy.  I don't color my hair but I do get frizzies and split ends, and some dryness.  I tried this product out after receiving a small sample with a [...] order, and fell in love with it.  I -love- the smell, and was surprised that other people didn't seem to.  I vastly prefer it to some of the faker, more chemical smells that a lot of shampoos seem to use.

I didn't use it as a leave in, but did the deep conditioning treatment, and afterwards I kept flipping my hair forward over my shoulder, both to smell it and to just feel how amazingly soft it was.  This product left my hair looking healthy, shiny, and gorgeous for days.  I get a fair number of compliments on my hair in general, but after I used this stuff I was getting stopped on the street.  Everyone from the lady at Starbucks to my professor mentioned how beautiful my hair looked.  I highly recommend it.

I have tried a lot of hair products, including some (like Fekkai's glossing cream) made with olive oil, and had better results with Ojon (though I do like a lot of Fekkai products).  Other products I recommend are: Healthy Sexy Hair shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in conditioner, Jonathan Product Anti-Frizz Serum, Origins Happy Ending conditioner, and Fekkai products for curly and straight hair, depending on your mood :)  Products I don't recommend include Suave and Fekkai's Glossing Shampoo (left my hair shiny all right, but frizzy.)

I would suggest ordering it from Sephora, as they carry several sizes, give samples with all online orders, and are very, very good at taking returns, even if you've tried the product out and just don't like it

  I have extremely dry skin that builds up and needs exfoliation frequently, and I've tried every body wash, gritty scrub, brush and soap known, from Clarins down to Caress, and this bar works like magic for me!  I didn't notice fantastic decrease in cellulite, and the little bumps do wear off. But using the soap practically "molts" me, leaving dead skin behind in the bathtub (yikes!), and I'm ready for application of other products right into my new skin (Fat Girl Slim...Clarins Total Body Firming Cream...I prefer Dior Plasticity).  And goodbye ingrown hairs- the stuff is great for prevention.  Did I metion a great exfoliator prior to self-tanning?  This stuff is a GREAT BUY!  The long-lasting soapy smell that interferes with my perfume is the only reason I gave it 4 stars

Tweezerman Browmousse is a clear gel that you brush onto your eyebrows to hold them in place. I had tried other brands of styling gels for brows and was left very disappointed - they flaked and looked all stiff and gross.

Since I am such a huge fan of the Tweezerman tweezers, I figured I would give their Browmousse a try and boy, was I ever satisfied! This gel held my brows in place all day without a single stray. No flaking! No stiff brows!

And it is so easy to apply. It comes with a mascara style brush that you simply whisk over your brows to style and keep them where you want them. It stays all day and comes off easily with make up remover. 

Browmousse is a definite step up from all other brands I've tried. I will recommend this product to all my friends.

This is the best concealer I have ever worn.  It covers well without making me look fake or cakey around the eyes.  Not greasy either.  The powder that comes with this is a nice touch for traveling.  However, I gave this a four star because it is pricey.  Amazon should try and give customers discounts.

This stuff goes on easy, stays well (but WILL rub off with water, won't withstand a good cry).  Nice.  Not quite as nice as the Victoria's Secret liner (I swear by that stuff, discontinued 3-4 years ago), but WAY better than anything cheaper.  I have TRIED other things.  Plus, won't irritate my very sensitive eyes

This eyeliner really matches the description, it goes on super smooth and doesn't tug or drag.  I was told at the counter that it was "water resistant" but it's really not.  I used to wear it under my lower eyelashes, but by the end of the day, it would be totally smudged and gross.  I would even try to put powder over it, but to no avail.  However, in defense of Laura, I am over 40 and the fine lines below my eyes aren't friendly to many pencil eye liners.  I was just hoping against hope that Laura's would be different!  So, now I only use it over the upper lid

Since I was in high school, so many women have praised the wonders of Almost Lipstick in Black Honey.  I finally self-gifted and purchased for myself, and all of my expectations have been met.  The color is initially scary in the tube, but at the very least swipe it on your hand - you'll see that it is actually a very wearable sheer brownish raspberry color.  You can layer it for a stronger color, or swipe it over lip balm to make it even more sheer.  The resulting effect is your lips, but better.  The color of your lips is improved and they are moist and shiny looking.  If you layer repeatedly over dry lips it is a very shiny deep red brown color.  I've seen Black Honey worn by fair/medium Asian and White women and has looked flattering on every one of them.  Lastly, the product does not smell.  It has no perfumes that become disgusting as the day wears on, nor does it have that cheap waxy smell/taste.  A fabulous product

I have used many, many products from the cheapest drugstore ones to the high end department store stuff and Kinerase cream is truly one of the best for overall skin improvement. I am a big fan of minimal redness and irritation and this cream delivers in spades. Leaves my skin beautifully soft, super smooth and all without added perfume (who's going to smell your face?) and additives. I have also used the lotion version which contains retinyl palmitate, but I much prefer this cream which adds more moisture and doesn't contain any retinoids which can cause irritation. Isn't that the whole premise and purpose of Kinerase anyway? Great stuff

I'm very particular about the stuff I put on my face.  I've used Nivea Aloe, Jack Black, Kiehls, &amp; Baxter among others.  I decided to give it a shot and all I can say is wow.  It says it's fragrance free, but it's got a small (very very very small) hint of lemon perhaps?  You only need a liberal amount and you're good to go.  Moisture is retained with glycerin and it soothes with aloe and chamomile (Mmmm).  If you're looking for subtle, yet tasteful facial lotion that's made for men, you've gota try this.  It's even allergy tested.  Not to mention, part of the proceeds are donated to prostate cancer research.

If you have dry skin on your hands these gloves are very nice.  I place mine in the microwave for 15 seconds while I apply moisturizer to my hands.  Slide the gloves onto your hands as soon as the microwave is finished.  In 15 minutes you have a quick, but effective moisturizing treatment.  If your hands are really dry you could do the same thing but leave them on overnight.  I found the overnight option to be a little warm on my hands.  But, it might work fine for you.

These socks are 94% cotton and 6% Spandex.  They can be machine washed and tumbled dried.  I have not found it necessary launder them each time I use them.  I use a light moisturizer (Cetaphil), so you might have a different experience if you use a heavier product to moisturize.

I would highly recommend this product.

This is the best long-wearing lipstick I have ever bought. It lasts on me for about 6-7 hours...through meals, drinks, etc. The best part is that it isn't flakey. It also has little hints of "glitter" in it, that really make your lips shine. The icing on the cake is that it has a subtle watermelon smell.

This is hands down the best all day lipwear I have ever owned. I own alot!!! Not only does it stay on all day beautifully but it does not dry your lips out. With other extended wearlipsticks you are given a seperate hydrating gloss. Sephora Maniac Long Wearing Lipstick does not need it. My lips never dried out and looked moist and smooth all day not cakey and cracked as others tend to do. Purchase this lipstick with cofidence and without hesitation. You will not be disappointed

For a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is MAC. Lipglass feels good on your lips, as if it contained some emollients. And (this is a big AND) it's not tacky or sticky. 

The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. 

Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. 

Enjoy!

I changed this review from when I first wrote it a couple of weeks ago.  When I first wrote it, the title was "I like it".  Now I've changed it to "I love it!!!" because the more I use it, the more sure I am that I will not EVER buy regular mascara again.  This mascara will NOT smudge!  It will not leave "racoon eyes" under your lash line.  It goes on where you put it and stays there until you take it off.  It also does not irritate my eyes.  I never thought I would find a mascara that didn't make me want to rub and rub my eyes.  I hate rubbing my eyes because I know it makes them baggy and makes wrinkles.  I have been seeing mascara which forms a tube around the lash advertised in high-end catalogs lately, and have been intrigued.  When I found out Philosophy, a brand I really respect, had this type of mascara available, I had to order it right away.  As soon as the UPS man brought it, I applied it.  It makes your lashes look really long!  They have a lot of individual definition, and show up as very distinct.  This mascara doesn't "fatten" the lashes, but it lengthens them so much, and it is a much cleaner look than the lash thickening mascara I have been using.  I really like the look, and the mascara does not smudge, or rinse off easily in water.  It seems to stay on really well, without the clumpy, greasy feeling I get from waterproof mascara.  It comes off neatly in little chunks when you rub a little "Purity Made Simple" cleanser on it.  I really like this mascara, and I will buy it again.  Actually I am going to throw out all my other kinds of mascara and only get this kind

I bought the Lotion #2 and the Moisurizing Gel about 3 weeks ago [which is wonderful], but passed on the soap. I'm a teenager who has a slight problem with acne, so that's why I bought the Neutrogena Acne Wash instead, which has salicylic acid that will help for acne. 
By itself, the acne wash does not work, but so far with the Clinique, I have not broken out at all! Not a single pimple. Everything is smooth and toned. I love my skin and it GLOWS.
I recommend getting the milder lotion for people with fairer and more sensitive skin, as this is known to peel and cause redness to some.
The salicylic acid is necessary for me and my light breaks-out-during-THAT-time-of-month skin. So if you do not have an acne problem, I think any soap is alright. 

To anyone who is worried about spending too much money:
If it does not work for you, there is a guarantee that lets ou get all your money back. It's great

I like this scent. My first thought was pears, before reading what the notes were, yes, apples. This is not a hardcore apple scent, but enough so.

Very fresh and sweet but not too sweet. Crisp and spring-like. A hint, a tiny hint of dandelions and a tiny bit of rose, just a tiny bit. 

My husband likes this scent on me as well, which is saying a lot. He hates roses and foody scents, but still likes this.

The Bourjois Precision Eyebrow Pencil is the best I've ever used.  I highly recommend it. Also, the brow brush that comes attached to the cover is very nice and leave the brows looking 'finished' and natural. I have senitive skin and had absolutely no problems with this product

This keychain is very cute and great if your'e friends want to try it becuase it is cheap, so they can buy it for themselves.  I have the Pixie flavor, and it is great. But, it fell off my purse once, so that's why I am not giving this item five stars. If they made the keychain a little stronger, I would definetly give it a five

I recently bought all 3 of Hard Candys, Key To My Heart Lipgloss. There are 2 different shades of lipgloss, a sheer shade and a darker thicker shade. My favorite one out of the 3 is Pop, It is a sheer light purple with shimmer and a darker purple gloss. They smell and taste like candy. It dangles on my keys and it is so cute! It might be handy to bring a pocket lipbrush with you so it doesnt get on your fingers

This product is just another example of why I am an Anthony's customer for life. I could spend all day extolling the virtues of the entire Anthony product line... 
Meanwhile, this alcohol free toner is just fantastic. If you have super-duper sensitive skin as I, you will love this product.. I guarantee it. The toner does not burn, irrate, cause peeling or rashes to develop, nor does it dry your skin out. It leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed, with a very mild lite scent that dissipates in seconds. When using this product, only a few drops is needed per application onto a cotton ball. To get the full benefits of this toner, the only requirements are just a few light and gentle sweeping outward motions, away from the face. Before you know it.. "Voila"! the daily grime and pollutants no longer reside on your face

This product actually works as described, it helped significantly improve the appearance of a scar created by a chemical burn within 2 weeks. The scar is still visible but has lightened a number of shades and feels smoother. I highly recommend this produc

To be totally honest, I'm not entirely sure what these ingredients are all about, but I do know one thing: this stuff really works! After using this for a couple of weeks, I started noticing a visible change in the small dark spots on my face. It wasn't dramatic, but I kept using the Repair Formula, and about a month later, I could definitely see a difference! People have commented on the way I look, and I recommend it to all of them. It just makes your skin look healthier.

I've been using this product for a few years now, and it always rescues me when my eczema pops up in the cold weather.  I once did a comparison between cortisone cream and Dream Cream, and the Dream Cream won hands down because it kept the scalies away longer than the cortisone did.

The scent is lavender/herbal and very nice.

I have a persistent patch of eczema on my neck, that Dream Cream cleared up in just a couple of weeks. I've also been using it daily as a hand lotion and just after I get out of the shower on my legs. It has completely gotten rid of the red, bumpy and scaly patches that have plagued my legs in the winter. I've tried dozens of body lotions/creams and this is my absolute favorite

What I really like about this product is that little goes a long, long way.

I used to use various body butters on my driest skin, and this product is like those in that you don't need to use much of it.  Just a bit is enough, even for really dry areas like elbows, knees, and feet.  I find one fingertipful is enough for both knees and elbows or for both feet; two fingertipfuls are enough for my legs, post-shaving.

I like it better than body butters because it is light and not greasy (unless you use too much), and you can use it on your whole body, not just the drier spots.

Another big plus is the scent: it's a fresh, clean herbal scent that doesn't linger over-long, so you can enjoy it while you're putting it on and not have to smell it all day long

I really like this product.  I would not, however, agree with the person who said that it is entirely too strong a scent.  I would actually like it to be stronger, and have less peel and more juice smell.  But it is a nice scent, and cleans very thoroughly.  Not the best I've used, but very nice

I received a coupon for a free sample of the Kinerase C6 Peptide in a magazine. It said it was a thirty dollar value, it was .25 oz and I was surprised at how small thirty dollars was! But what the heck it was free. Well it has lasted over three weeks so far using it once to twice a day and it actually seems to work! My complexion is brighter I have less adult acne, a constant problem, and I just feel my face looks better. I've been ill for a few months and my face was looking bad, I think so anyway. I'm one of those people who look ten years younger than my age but I certainly wasn't lately. All I can say is it works very well for me so much so that I'm probably going to invest the 96.00 to buy the 1 oz, I figure it's worth it and will last about three months.

I always buy this soap when I travel in France.  When I found it on Amazon, I was elated!  It is so moisturizing that I never need to use any body creams or lotions.  With its simple and pure properties of Olive Oil, Vegetable Oil and Mediterranean Sea Salted water; "Savon de Marseille" is the ultimate soap to use for dry skin.  The large 1000gm. blocks are a great value, and they can be cut easily into four individual 250gm. bars.  Great for ones' own personal use.  For gift giving the 300gm. bars are perfect!  If you want to walk out of the shower and not immediately feel compelled to put on hand cream or body cream, use this Masterpiece Soap

This is a great lipstick and a wonderful idea from CARGO. I would very much recommend it. The lindsay color is great and the formula is very smooth and sheer enough so that it goes well with your skin. The four stars are because I love smelly things... and this one just smells like lipstick.  It could smell yummier I suppose. But so far, I love it

Clinique's Bare Brilliance is one of my absolute favorite lipsticks ever!
It has a fairly sheer finish with lovely little sparkles in it.  I have Berrylicious(sheer grape) and Cherry Quartz(sheer, true red--doesn't look like it does on the color swatch) and neither overwhelms my pale skin.  I wouldn't be caught dead without a Bare Brilliance lipstick in my makeup bag or purse!

I've used a nylon scrubbie for years.  The Salux bath towel is much better!  I received it as a gift from someone who had one and knew how wonderful it was.  It has a fairly rough texture which is a fantastic exfoliator.  I use it with a bath gel (never soap, it's too drying) and my skin has never been softer.  It's extra long length makes it perfect for getting your entire back.  It drys very quickly - Can't live without it

"Frankincense contains sesquiterpenes, which may help oxygenate the pineal and pituitary glands. As one of the ingredients for the holy incense, it was used anciently to help enhance one's communication with The Creator. It may help promote a positive attitude." ~ pg. 148, Reference Guide for Essential Oils by Connie and Alan Higley

Bergamot oil is anti-inflammatory, antiseptic and good for the skin. Christopher Columbus originally brought Bergamot back to Italy from the Canary Islands. Frankincence oil is antiseptic and sedative

Together they are perfect for when you are feeling really stressed out or grumpy and want to relax. Toss this in the tub and you will have a violet fizz that soon turns the water a beautiful silky purple. 

This may be the most beautiful LUSH bath and the essential oils make you feel more grounded. Perfect as a bath before you do your relaxing yoga routine at night before bed. You may want to skip lotion after your bath and try the It's a Pleasure Treasure massage bar which is scented with myrrh. If you enjoy the Bergamot in this product, it is also in Lush The Olive Branch and The Comforter Bubble Bar. Cynthia Sylvia Stout shampoo and Veganese conditioner go well with this experience since they are also citrusy. 

I will agree, this doesn't exactly have a blackberry scent, but it is a beautiful violet colored bath that will impress with its calming and skin healing properties.

This is my absolute favorite product by LUSH. I received a huge box of bath ballistics for my birthday, and out of the whole thing this was the best! it made the water a nice purple color (without a ring around the tub) and made my skin smell great - even the next day! I would recommend this one to any first-timers, so you can see what the buzz around LUSH is all about! I am stocking up on this one

This is a great product.  The only reason I don't give it a full five stars is that it is alleged to not have 'significant' amounts of vitamin E, which is supposed to be its selling point.  I, however, buy it because for the five years or so that I have used this product, I have gotten a LOT of compliments about the firmness of my skin, and since I have started using it my skin has actually become LESS oily than when I first started using it.  

I first purchased this product because of some damage I had done to my skin using a popular acne product.  My skin looked and felt as though I had been burned by acid.  I promptly stopped using that product and purchased this cream along with the cream cleanser because I hoped these products would be soothing.  They definitely were.  Within a matter of weeks my skin started to feel better.  Moreoever, it took on a plump, more youthful appearance (no sagging!).  Within a month or so, my skin was much less oily than it had been.  

Since I first purchased this product I have strayed but have always come back.  In the winter I use the heavier nightcream and have experienced the same results.  The regular cream is pink in color and does not smell of perfume.  Texture wise it is heavier than a lotion but still feels slippery to the touch.  I highly recommend you try this cream

Rock Star soap appeals to my playful side and the scent in this soap leaves one a little giddy. The sweet vanilla fragrance is blended with perfumes and the result is something like a spicy vanilla and strawberry milkshake. Can I say yum? 

This is absolutely delish and I think they may have added a little cinnamon to the mix. I love keeping lush soaps by the sink because they don't seem to dry out my hands as much as gel soaps. This one is perfect in combination with the Smitten hand cream. 

Rock Star soap left me dreaming about buying other "vanilla" themed items like Think Pink (which I tried), Creamy Candy (a bubble bar), Sympathy for the Skin (which I'm dying to try) and Honey Trap (which I just tossed recklessly into my shopping cart). Candy Fluff sounds like it would go well with this experience. If you love this soaps creamy consistency, Gratuitous Violets, Sultana of Soap and Alkmaar will impress. 

Any chance the vanilla toothpaste will be listed here soon? Wish, wish...

it has been over 4 hours since i showered and i still catch the scent as i move. it is such a sweet, sugary smell that reminds me of summertime and pop music. this may sound like an odd description, but it smells the way the inside of a jawbreaker tastes, sweet and sugary. it also has a hint of cherry or strawberry to it. yum yum! i got two bars and cut one up into small cubes to wrap in cloth and put in my dresser drawers to scent my clothes. i love love love this stuff. 

the reviewer who said this only lasts a week must use a TON of soap (though who could blame her with a soap like this?)or take multiple baths/showers a day, because i have used it for a week and it doesn't look any smaller than when i first opened it. it REALLY helps to unwrap soap as soon as you get it so it can air harden before you use it. this helps it last longer.

A Word to the Wise about Size

If this is your first time buying Lush soap online, be forewarned. You will receive a piece that is about 1" thick and 4-5" long. In other words, you will be receiving a fairly small piece of soap. If you have a Lush store near you, I strongly recommend that you go and smell the huge chunks of soap they have on display. Once you find a scent you like, buy a Â½ lb brick of it. It will cost a little over $20, but it is worth it if you find a soap you love. I also find that it is easier to experience the full scent of a soap with a bigger slice. I know that Lush stores are few and far between (the closest one to me is about 35 miles away--not that far, but too far to be convenient), but if you can grab a couple of friends and make a road trip out of it, it's an adventure!

Now, on to Rock Star. What a delightful soap. If you are a fan of the Mmmm....Melting Marshmallows bath melt, then you will also enjoy Rock Star. The scent is the same. It is also the same as Snow Fairy Shower Gel and the Creamy Candy bath melt.  I cannot quite place my finger on the scent. The main ingredient in it is Vanilla absolute, but this smells much more sweet and girly.  There is a definite floral scent lurking under the vanilla, but I am at a loss to try and describe it! It sort of smells like warm cotton candy with a hint of brown sugar. It's the closest I can come to trying to describe the scent.

The scent of Rock Star will linger on your skin for the entire day. It's absolutely wonderful. It also leaves your bathroom smelling wonderfully fresh.  Every time my husband uses the upstairs bathroom, he has to come find me and ask what smells so good in our bathroom. It is a fabulously creamy soap and it lathers quite well. If you have white tile in your bathroom, it will leave a pink lather pile on the tile, but it is easy enough to wash off. 

There are a couple of minor downsides to Rock Star. But they are minor: 

1. It melts way too fast. I just wished it lasted a bit longer.

2. It can leave the skin feeling a bit too squeaky clean. When I first started using Rock Star, I thought it would give me dry skin, but that hasn't been the case. It just feels a bit dry after showering. 

Despite these small issues, Rock Star is the perfect soap to make you feel a bit girly and a bit sexy, all at the same time.

I can't give this enough stars!  Truly love this!  I just purchased a huge hunk from the Herald Square store!  I'm well impressed with this soap!   When I first got it from Lush I was disappointed with the smell.  It made me a bit sick.   Next day I hopped in the shower with it and started singing like a rock star!  OH BABY I love the smell!  It's like a brand new smelly eraser you had when you were a kid!   Smells good enough to eat!   This is on my MUST have list of items!  Gimme that fruity-candy goodness!  If you adore it...layer it up with Snow Fairy and Candy Fluff...and float around in a haze of sweetness all day long!  Beware..can be very addicting once you use it!

There is actually science to support this serum, and per a D Magazine article, several female dermatologists use it on their own skin.  You spread a few drops on your face (and I use it on my neck and back of my hands as well) in the morning before sunscreen or makeup.  It does not irritate my sensitive skin (I have rosacea and seb derm) or clog my pores.  A lot of expensive products are just hype, but I think the science and the fact that so many dermatologists use it make this one worth the money.

Sephora Roll-up blotting paper is so handy. Whenever you have to freshen up, this is great to use before you powder your face. All you do is rip off the right about of paper you want and blot your face. They feel weightless and matte skin. Just imagine all the oil that gets trapped into a powder puff. gosh. disgusting! Best of all, you get so much paper, the roll is never-ending! It's so tiny and compact, you would even want to share them with your friends

This is one of the most perfect concealers I have ever used. It goes on nice and creamy (does not pull on your skin when applying) and covers those imperfections.  You also do not need a lot of product to get the job done.  The colors are very natural and I have found a perfect color in Sand for me. I will buy this product again.

I have been using this powder for about 5 years. It is amazing. I have problems with red cheeks and breakouts. Once I put on my concealer and foundation, I put on this powder and it is truly what makes my imperfections disappear. It even comes with the perfect application brush. This powder is worth every penny because it does what a powder should do

I did my Christmas shopping in my warm fluffy nightgown. The package arrived before Christmas. I did not pay for gas for shopping, I did not fight for a parking space and I did not stand in long lines to pay for my prize.
My mom's favorite cologne was also at least 10-20 dollars cheaper then the big stores overhead pricing. This is the way to go

I first got to smell this amazing perfume as a sample in a Cosmo magazine.  Since then I could not help but want to keep smelling it over and over again. 

It reminds me alot of my perfume I use now, but it smells so much more sweeter.  I now use Jovan White Musk(love this one as well), but decided to try this perfume and fell in love with it as well.  I love musky scents like this one.  This perfume has a crisp, warm, and musky smell to it.

I would highly recommend this perfume to any of the ladies out there that are looking for something to drive their man wild, trust me, it works wonders.  

I receive compliments all the time on this perfume and it has a long lasting affect that does not get sour or overpowering as it wears on throughout the day,which most perfumes can do.

I love this perfume, what more can I say............other then I highly recommend it!!!!!!!!!!

A personal tip I would like to suggest is to spray this perfume or any perfume of your choice on your hair, just two quick sprays and the smell lasts much longer then on your skin. Make sure your hair is dry and styled before doing this.

I have tried Ralph Lauren's "Romance" Eau de Parfum Spray and I love its lush floral scent, so romantic and sophisticated. I use it only on very special occasions and I've often been asked: "What perfume are you wearing? It smells so good." I spray it behind my ears and wrists for a long-lasting effect. So leave a scent of you behind with                Ralph Lauren "Romance" Eau de Parfum Spray. 

A perfume that means always and forever in bloom. 

Wholeheartedly recommended.

This is a really nice little bomb, and smells of those little candy conversation hearts that come out for Valentine's day each year. Sort of tangy and light and sweet. But as with all that Lush does, there is a depth to this scent that makes it interesting enough to enjoy bathing in time and time again.

The tonka oil in it is good for helping you to forgive yourself and for relaxation, according to the first Lush Times catalog it appeared in, so whenever I am having a bad day or kicking myself for making a silly mistake, I bathe in this and feel better. It also has lavender for relaxation and neroli to uplift the spirits.

The only downside to this bomb is that the scent doesn't linger much at all once you get out of the bath, which is disappointing to me since it smells so good! Still, it is a worthy bath bomb and the cheery pink water and uplifting scent make it one I come back to time and time again

I pulled the lid of the Philosphy Vanilla Birthday Cake bottle and inhaled the wonderful smell of vanilla birthday cake.  It smells 100% like its glorious namesake.  While some people complain about feeling strange bathing in birthday cake or a strawberry milkshake, I think of it as being just another type of aromatherapy.  Cake makes me happy, birthdays make me happy, this birthday cake smelling body wash and shampoo really makes me happy!  

Plus as a bodywash and shampoo it functions very well.  My skin feels smooth, and my hair feels light, silky and not weighed down.  My hair still smells a little like birthday cake, which isn't as good the second day, but it's not overpowering.  I don't think I will use this as my everyday shampoo, but it is great to throw in a gym bag for a quick after-workout shower

       Okay, so our Moms said we shouldn't compare, but I couldn't help it once I found Sephora's Powder Brush.  It's hair and handles above all the rest.  Used to think a brush was a brush was a brush, which is probably why my "rest" includes artificial haired brushes that left powdered streaks on my face and one that shed whatever kind of hairs it possessed faster than a Sheepdog in August.

	Enough of my sad cosmetic catastrophes - this Sephora brush is made of 100% goat hair, fine and soft to pick up powder and allow you to apply either pressed or loose powder sleekly and smoothly.  Did I say it feels like silk on your skin?  It does.

	Additionally, the brush hairs are rounded rather than cut straight across so it"s quick on the "pick-up" and consistently even on the distribution.  Of course, it's good looking with a state-of-the art silver handle.  It measures 8 inches - more importantly, it measures up to everything a perfect powder brush should be.

This philosophy kit really works for people with consistant light to moderate acne. I've tried just about everything out there-prescription topicals &amp; pills, Pro-activ, and all the over the counter stuff. I have adult acne, I never experienced acne as a teenager. When I first started using Philosophy's kit I didn't notice a huge change in the first few weeks, beyond pimples clearing up faster. Around week 5 or 6, I began to notice that I wasn't waking up to a new zit every morning and I didn't feel oily at the end of the day. Now, I have been using for 4 months and feel like a new person. I don't have to cover my face with concealer or retouch make-up throughout the day. I can walk out the door with just powder on my face for the first time in years! I would recommend this kit to anyone who can't use benzoyl peroxide and is frustrated with all the other products on the market

Hi, I just wanted to let everyone out their know: that this stuff works. 

I have had problematic hormonal acne since the age of 21. I'm 27 now. 

After I graduated from the university and started working a real job, the stress went straight to my face (you all know what I am talking about). Unfortunately for me, I am allergic to benzyl peroxide and I have extremely sensitive skin. I also do not do well with tea tree oils and most sulfur and acidic products (basically anything that can kill acne - leaves my face itchy- either swollen like a tomato or is ineffective and I have painful acne bumps...which would you rather do?).

I was a little hesitant after reading the ingredients and noticed that the cleanser had sulfur in it and there was also a jar of pure salicylic acid for blemishes. But, after using other philosophy products for my hair and body - I decided to give it a try. Hell, what's another 50 bucks if it can clear my acne - and if not I can always send it back.

I started using it about 3 weeks ago and my skin has had a tremendous transformation. I finally feel like my acne is under control. I recommend this product fully and it is my duty to tell everyone this after suffering with relentless acne for so many years. 

The cleanser is awesome and needs to be in a larger size. The blemish serum is extremely drying, so if you are sensitive like me read the directions and take it slow - don't reapply throughout the day, until your skin is ready. The day and night face creams are cool. The day one is kind of like glue and seals in the treatment - the entire day! That's why it works, because it is on your face until night time when you wash (I can even faintly smell the product). Then you use your night hydrogen peroxide cream, yes not benzyl. Yeah, this cream is intense as well. So take it slow until your skin is ready. 

One thing that I do recommend is that if you wear make-up, use the purity cleanser (not in the kit) to initially clean your skin and then use the acne cleanser. That's what I do and it works for me - so I will share it with you.

Another thing I do is I will take a little bit of the hope is not enough SPF moisturizer and put on very little on my super dry areas. Remember this acne kit is intense and you may be prone to drying out and peeling - so some oil-free moisturizer can help hydrate the area around the acne.

Well that's about it. I hope this helps you and let's you know that your acne can be tamed and doesn't have to run your life. 

Take care,
M. Rodriguez

The shade I use is Subtle Lips. I love it! It gives some color but not so much that I feel done up. I could be in complete casual clothes and throw it on and feel great. And yet it looks great on Sundays too. Because of the mild color it matches everthing. And unlike lip gloss, it's not sticky at all. (I can't tolerate any stickiness!) I am only somewhat picky about scent and taste, and to me this one has neither. I think it is by far worth the $20!!

       Glamorous, mysterious, seductive all describe Armani Code, a captivating orange blossom based scent from Giorgio Armani Fragrance.

	As one would expect from this master couturier the bottle itself is a gem.  Tapering from a weighted base the slim flacon seems to glow as lacquered shades of blue sweep from an early dawn at the bottom of the sleek holder to midnight nearing the top.  Adding to the fragrance's intrigue is an oriental effect achieved by  lace embroidery on the glass.

	The scent  is sweet yet sensuous with a sparkle provided by orange zest.  With orange blossom at its heart Armani Code is enhanced by Sambac jasmine, Madagascan vanilla and honey.  The man in my life called it "delicious," and I do, too.  It's now high on my list of favorite fragrances.

This one could appeal to a variety of fragrance lovers as it seems to find that middle ground in preferences. It's not too spicy, not sickeningly sweet. It's not trying to do too much. Just effortless. One thing I like about this, you're not at risk at dousing yourself and offending other noses. I hate smelling or leaving a trail of perfume in the air. This one has restraint. Staying power is debatable but it's such a wonderful, confident woman scent, I gave it 5 stars

This is one of the most beautiful, sexy scents currently on the market.  If you are a gourmand/oriental fragrance lover (examples of which include Thierry Mugler's Angel or Angel Innocent, Bvlgari's Omnia, Calvin Klein's Euphoria, or Burberry's Brit - all of which I own and wear regularly without longevity issues - see next paragraph) then I would highly recommend this fragrance.  Sweet, but in a sexy, subtle musky way.  

I would bathe myself in this fragrance if I could.  And I should.  As noted by the previous reviewer, this fragrance is gone in flash.  I give myself about 5 hearty sprays of this in the morning, including two directly misted onto my clothing in an effort to extend the fragrance, but it is gone by noon.  This is truly perplexing.  Every other Giorgio Armani frangrance that I own, including Sensi, Emporio She, and Armani Code for Men (also great for women), can go the distance.  

This is supposed to be Eau de Parfum, but wears very much like Eau de Toilette.  Someone seriously skimped on the oil base.  It that doesn't trouble you terribly, pick this one up.  If you want something similar that will last through the entire day and most of the night, and particularly love the musk component of this fragrance, then I would wholeheartedly recommend checking out Narciso Rodriguez's "For Her" or "Musc for Her" instead

After seeing this in a magazine, I decided I had to try it so I ordered a small sized tub from Sephora.  OMG what an amazing change to my hair.

I am a perpetual hair dyer and last year had a perm that I then straightened because I hated it.  Top that off with living in Hawaii prior to that, and between the color, sun, and perm my hair was getting a little sad.

This stuff is amazing. From the first time I used it, my hair was shiny and very soft.  

I call it the "dirty hippy hair stuff" since it smells like incense.

I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.

If you don't want to pay the Sephora or QVC prices, buy it on ebay.  I have a found a seller there that sells the large tub for $20 cheaper than what you buy it at Sephora for

i've been using ojon for a year or so, and my hair has never been healthier.  i have long, fine, wavy hair which i flat iron about 5 times a week; this product definitely keeps your hair shiny and protected from heat damge and split ends.  hair stylists are always amazed at the great condition my hair is in being that i heat treat it so often, and i get comments all the time from friends, family, and just people i encounter about how shiny and pretty my hair looks.  the smell is distinctive (not offensive in my opinion), but you wash the product out out!  my hair smells like my shampoo/conditioner, so i really don't understand what the other posts about the smell are trying to say.  i definitely reccomend this product and do so often.

I have thick, coarse, african-american hair that is relaxed (permed straight). I usually use this product on wet hair (after a shampoo)when blow-drying my hair straight. It makes it really smooth and shiny. I have received a lot of compliments on my hair since I have started using it. In warm temperatures it does melt down but in my opinion it makes it easier to use. When it is a solid you are supposed to rub it in the palm of your hands to liquify it and then put it in your hair. It does have a smokey scent to it but no one pays attention to that...they are looking at how great my hair is. I love Ojon's conditioner (it is the very best I have ever used)but the shampoo in my opinion seems to dry my hair.

I don't know about the people who gave 1 or 2 star reviews but this product is the ONLY thing that saved my hair. I did everything from getting a curly perm to stripping the color. I used coconut oil, frequent trims, keratin treatments and NOTHING worked. My hair still kept breaking and splitting like clockwork. When I used the product, 3 treatments later and it's never been healthier. The product is very oily, so USE SPARINGLY when you use it as a gloss or leave in conditioner!

P.S. People with healthy, not-so-damaged, and normal hair do not need to use this stuff. Because if you do, you'll get silly comments from a tree-hugger that has nothing to do with the product. This product is only for heavy duty damage! By the way, the ONLY thing good from John Frieda is Frizz-Ease...

This is absolutely the best concealer EVER. I have skin that is very sensitive and prone to breakouts with face makeup - this stuff hasn't been a problem! It stays put all day long, and does not shine

Almost immediately after using this face mask the redness in my face was gone.  It helps with a number or skin problems, and I have sensitive skin so it's hard to find a product that won't hurt me.  Most facial masks cause a minor chemical burn, this left my face beautifully soft.  If you're unsure of this product, or wavering at all, let me tell you that you should buy it, it's amazing.

This is a life-changing product if you have any issues with eye shadow creasing.  You just smooth a little of this product on your eyelids before applying eye shadow, and it provides a perfect base.  Twelve hours later, the shadow is still perfectly in place.  I bought this at a Neiman Marcus store, but the product is so good I wanted to make sure I rated it online so others would know how great it is!

I am very impressed with the whole Bobbi Brown line.  This lip gloss is no exception.  These lip glosses come in tubes with wands that have a small lip brush on the end.  The colors are fantastic.  These glosses are all very neutral, and natural looking colors.  None of these glosses are going to make you look too made up; just make you look finished.  The texture is not too tacky or sticky.  And it has a light scent, not very strong and overall its a very good lip gloss.  I highly recommend these lip glosses and will continue to purchase them.

HI

<review_text>
I have thick and very coarse hair (as you read in the title) that I am trying to grow out, and I have tried everything before to help tame the mane.  I always look for a product that not only puts back moisture into my hair, but something that can fortify it as well to prevent more damage.  I've tried almost every single intensive conditioner in the stores and tried a lot in the salons as well, however this one I came across by accident.

My aunty had gone to a Frederic Fekkai promo sale and bought a WHOLE bunch of stuff.  It didn't really do much for her hair, so she passed them on to me to try.  Some of the stuff I wasn't too impressed with, but this hair mask did wonders for my hair!

After just one use, I could totally tell a difference in the feel and texture of my hair.  Usually, I have to straighten or blow dry my hair when its wet to tame it, however this product I didn't have to do too much after.  I let my hair air dry and just put in a anti-frizz cream after, and that was good.

The mask washes out clean (no greasy residue), so this product is really good for weekly restoration.  But from what it seems like, this hair mask (along with all products, I suppose) work for some people and not for others.  Your best bet is to get your hands on a sample size before you shell out the money for a full tube, since it can be kind of expensive

I got a free sample of this product at a Nordstroms trend show and decided to use it the other day. My hair is pretty course and frizzy and long, but it is also more kinky curls instead of big, round, ringlets. Well, I let my hair air dry then applied a serum to take care of the frizz. Then I put some in my hair (you don't need much) and scrunched and twisted my hair. It worked wonderfully! My hair was bouncy and had lots of volume and was very shiny and curly, the best i have ever seen it! I got a lot of compliments on it too. The only thing is that if you use too much your hair gets too shiny and looks oily, also it doesnt have much hold at all, so a good hair spray really does the trick with this. Besides that, it is a wonderful curl enhancer

Anyone who gave this lotion a low rating simply did so because they don't realize achieving GREAT curly hair is a process. There is no ONE product that can do all the work.

I have thick, frizzy, DAMAGED, curly hair. I use this lotion after using my favorite shine serum, then after letting air dry for a few minutes finish with gel or mousse for hold.

The curl enhancing lotion really REALLY improves the look of my curls - from uneven ringlets and loose waves, to an almost universal loose big curl - it's beautiful!

The only downside is the TINY bottle for such a high price. It should be at least 8oz

I love this light curing lotion! It smells like orange/vanilla creamsicle. It enhances the curls in my naturally curly hair, makes it more moisturized, and smells great! It has no hold, so if you need hold you'll need to use a gel over it. Love it, and worth the $s

Wow!  Shesheido has done it again!  I love thier products!  I have oily skin...so I like to blot my face once a day.  The papers are awesome...very soft.  They soak up the oil and I can tell after I throw the paper away.  Usually 1 sheet a day is all I need and my face is shine-free!  I love them!  I also like this product becuase you get 100 sheets which is the most I have seen so far.  I love this product and will buy again

I first got a whiff of this from a magazine enclosure.  It got me curious, as they rarely do.  Passing Sephora, I went in for a test...and felt seduced by the classy charm of the scent.  It seemed to have a rich sophistication which goes with horseback riding or polo.  After a few days, I still couldn't get the scent out of my head so I went back to grab it up.  I've only had this experience with a few other fragrences...but they were of a totally different style...Angel by Thierry Mugler and Flower by Kenzo

The perfume is very subtle with a little hint of sweetness.  It's not overpowering or musky. Don't try to sniff the bottle or a sample...it won't do it justice.  You have to try it on your skin to know how great it smells.  I've had other designer frangrances, but this is by far my favorite and I've received a lot of compliments

I have tried every lip plumper on the market (no joke) and this is the best (besides pure cinnamon leaf oil, which burns like hell).  I use B.E. products and I bought a couple of these bc I liked the colors.  I was not expecting it to work as well as it did.  Now it is all I use on my lips! It makes your lips feel cool, not burning

I am new to the world of gloss and haven't tried that many brands but this is definitely on my keeper list. If you want something that plumps I would look elsewhere but if your looking for a subtle gloss that smells great and gives your lips a nice chilled feeling this is the gloss for you.

Very good product and great kind of fruity smell. leave hair soft and full of "bounce". Easy to comb hair after using this product but might be combine with Kerastase conditionner for very dry and damage hair if your hair are very long. The price here is still more expensive than in Europe: around 22 euros

I love this product - it's a lot more natural looking than foundation, and saves a step in the morning. It does a good job evening out skin tone, and it feels good on my dry skin. As someone who doesn't wear a lot of makeup, it adds that extra bit of "polish" that makes for a more professional appearance, without looking too made up

hey,

I have been using Min shampoo on/off for about six months, and can no longer go off the stuff because when I do there is  dramtic difference. As far as the smell goes, I don't need to smell like a coconut or a Bloomingsdale, just make it pleasant or oderless and give texture and fullness to my hair. I don't think it smells medicated, (unlike reviogen) but just doesn't have too strong of an oder. If more people knew of this product more people would be happier with their hair.

Let me say that this is the best skin care cream I have ever used and I know for a fact that it works because so many dermatologists stand behind it.  
I've used it for a little over a year now and I won't use anything else.  I don't know the last time I ever had to use an exfoliating scrub because what this does, is an automatic scrub.  It is gradually sloughing off dead skin cells for you and rendering the use of exfoliaters useless. 
I must say, it has a natural funky smell but you do adapt to that very quickly and won't notice it after a while.  You use it once a day for the first two weeks (while your skin gets used to it) and then twice a day thereafter if you want.  I only use it at night and a sunscreen throughout the day because the skin is a little more sensitive to the sun.
Caution - this is an acid cream.  I once had a minor paper cut on my finger (the same that I use to dip into the pot) and I still get tears in my eyes thinking of the pain I was in.  
This is an excellent cream and I strongly recommend it.  It won't get rid of wrinkles (you have to know that there is practically NOTHING on the market that will get rid of them) but it will soften the look of wrinkles and it will give your skin a beautiful softness and glow.  It's an amazing cream with true genuine results

Laura Mercier is, by far and away, my very very favorite line of lip color.  Over the years, I have tried hundreds of lipsticks, glosses, pots, pencils, you name it.  Laura's are the best. Here's why I like them:
1. Color is natural and semi-sheer so it looks light-weight, no matter what the shade
2. Colors are not garish - you won't be throwing them out next season.  Not to say that they are boring, just timeless and well thought out.
3. They last a long time.  Not all day, but I really hate those "all day" lip colors.  By mid-day, my lips are so dry and gross-flakey.  I've thrown away more of those cruddy "all day" lip colors than I care to remember.  Back to the point, my Laura lipstick easily lasts me through a 2-hour presentation to a client.
4. I only wear the Shimmer line in Fall, and guess what? Metallics are so "IN" for Fall 2005

This liner is thin as advertised, goes on easy, stays, and is really nice stuff.  Be warned, though, the lightest shade is REALLY light, and only good if you're REALLY pale.  It barely shows on me - I'm really pale with strawberry blonde hair and even I should've gone darker on the color.  Recommended

I'm nearly forty and I'm not going to give in to cellulite and wrinkles without a fight. I got this cream, and have been using it along with MBT trainer shoes and the occasional workout on an eliptical trainer. After one month, I'm starting to see results in the smoothness of my previously-lumpy legs. I can't say that it would work wonders alone, but as an add-on to an exercise program, it seems to be helping quite a lot. I've done weight-loss programs before, and they've never addressed the cellulite issue. This is the first thing that has seemed to work. And it's great moisturizer, too.

This is a very rich creme.  I find it works best for me if I use it all over my face once or twice a week.  My face breaks out if I use it more often.  I am 63 years old, so blemishes are not a common occurrence for me. Another alternative would be to use it only on the brow and under the eyes, but in that case I would recommend the StriVectin-SD eye creme which does not have the mint fragrance.

I bought some less than a week ago. I've been using it over my brows, between my eyes and under my eyes (although the directions say not to). Already the fine lines under my eyes have decreased dramatically.

I love the tingly feel of it as well. It's super expensive here in Canada ($200 a tube), but so far, it's worth the price. I'd definately buy it again

Unbelievable results, was considering Botax, when I heard about this product, thought to try. I have used several other products, never saw results like StriVectin-SD.  Used it as directed mainly between brows, on top of the lips and the neck. Within two weeks noticeable results especially around the lip area and the neck.  Have been using it for over 30 days, family and friends are noticing it.  Thank you for a great product.  Got all my friends start using.  Can't wait to try the Eye cream, just heard about it

These are great if you have oily or combination skin. Just press onto your face and it instantly takes away the oil and the shine. It won't ruin your makeup and you can use them discreetly almost anywhere, anytime. These are very similar to the blotting sheets sold by MAC cosmetics -- except these are cheaper and work just as great. I've even caught my boyfriend using it on his face so I guess it would be great for a Metrosexual. LOL!!! You'll love these as much as I do.

I have loved this product for so many years, but haven't found it for more than ten.  I flew to Spain and the Evian was an absolute necessity!  It's just the right amount of cool water as opposed to splashing water on your face out of a faucet.  It is very refreshing, and also brightens fading makeup.

I absolutely love Clinique for eye shadow. All of their eye shadows go on so smooth, never crease, and are just the perfect shades of colors for my skin tone. The Almost Peach color is great because I can use it as a highlighter under my brow or just as a base, either way I use it just about every day!  :

I have been using this powder for about 5 years. It is amazing. I have problems with red cheeks and breakouts. Once I put on my concealer and foundation, I put on this powder and it is truly what makes my imperfections disappear. It even comes with the perfect application brush. This powder is worth every penny because it does what a powder should do

i first bought this product because the woman at the store said that it renewed the skin, bringing newer skin to the surface.  and she added that it helps pull pimples out to the surface so you can get rid of them easier, i was a little wary a first, but it works.  my skin feels softer and looks more even all around.

It helps you dry and burns the wattery thing inside your face out.
This is a non toxic device used to heat up the pimples until it get small and dry.
This product is better than Proactiv. 
Proactive does not work on my face instead it irritates and get worst.
Try to wash your face with Dove skin soap for more than 1hr to soften your face and remove the pus. Then, path it dry and use Zeno, and don't over use this product because it might hurt and burn your skin.
Failure to use this product properly might cause 1st Degree burn.

Never use any chemicals on your face while using this product.

For excessive large pimples, I see some people apply a clean duct tape on their face, keep it for 3-8 hrs and remove it.
You would notice that all pus are lying on your face and you just need to clean it using clean water and a skin soap.

The regular price of this product is $150 for 60 Treatment Cycle.

HI

<review_text>
I am a hair fanatic... test and try everything.  This comb is the best comb I've come across for my hair.  I have a lot of thick hair, so this comb really does the job.  I have been using Avon combs for over 5 years now and love them.  Very strong and don't break easily.  Because my hair is thick, I still need to use conditioner to help detangle it, other wise my hair would be ruined.  Worth every penny, and for $4.99, you can't lose.

For over 7 years I have been battling Adult Acne Rosacea with little success.  I have used prescribed creams, facialists, OTC products, diet changes, etc. with minimal effects.  With the onset of winter I wanted to ensure my face was moisturized with the very low humidity.  While ordering a mister from Amazon, I noticed many people also ordered the Body Shop Vitamin E Face Mist.  I thought "why not"?  The results were almost immediate! The redness and breakouts have greatly diminished and I'm once again getting comments from people on how very nice my skin is looking.  You couldn't ask for an easier application and it doesn't give my skin a claustraphobic feeling.  And, the rose water scent is revitalizing and calming.  This is the best thing I've used in over 6 years.  I wholeheartedly recommend it, especially to premenopausal women  who are experiencing skin dryness

Is there anyone who doesn't know the name Sarah Jessica Parker? Okay. Think "Carrie" on TV's enormously successful "Sex and the City." She was the gal who dressed to the nines - always with style and glamour. She brings both of those qualities to her first fragrance, "Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker." 

It's a unique, almost indescribable blend of classicism, chic, and innocence. There's not a scent like it with top notes of fresh Mandarin, Bergamot, Lavender, and Apple Martini. Vibrant and warm it's a fragrance that caresses the senses. 

Middles notes are Patchouli, tender Paper Whites, and luxe Orchid. These are enhanced by bottom notes of irresistible white amber, sensuous cedar, and the very sultry musk. This is a scent I revel in, and enjoy wearing. 

The bottle is, of course, simple and exquisite, curved with polished glass, ultra feminine. 

Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker is a beautiful, dreamy yet quite alive fragrance appropriate for every occasion. 

- Gail Cooke

eyeshadow in the world. Being new to this makeup line this kit was en excellent addition.  The colors, vanilla sugar eye shadow (a light creamy peach), fashionista liner shadow (a  rum raisin/brown),peach puff eyeshadow (creamy peach), and explore soft focus eye shadow (medium brown) all blend together so that you cannot tell where one color starts and the other begins.  Applying your bareminerals foundation first, glues it all on.  The included booklet guides you along. 

Being in my 40's, natural looking is the name of the game for me. No glitter, sparkles, heavy eye liners etc.  This kit accomplished that.  I got brave and tried the "foiling" effect and fell in love ! The colors did not migrate, the liner stayed in place for over 12 hours, and I had no eye irritation at all.

Do yourself a favor and try this out !  You will never go back to other eye makeup.  I recommend this to everyone I know, you won't be dissappointed

This is a perfect winter cream for me, and would probably work for anyone else who has very dry skin (e.g., you rub Eucerin on at night).  It is very similar to the regular cream in appearance (pink) and smell (not offensive), but it is much heavier.  I started using this during the winter when I discovered the regular cream wasn't heavy enough and it works just as well.  It spreads on pretty easily for such a thick cream and when I wake up my skin is dewy and moisturized.

As a fragrance addict I will try anything once- but I am hooked on this stuff.  I don't often purchase solid perfumes as all of the ones I have tried tend to be greasy feeling on, and don't last very long.  This is completely different- it's easy to apply but isn't at all greasy and last quite a while.  This scent is beautiful and floral/spicy and not overpowering.  If you enjoy Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker, I think you'll enjoy this too- plus you can take it anywhere- it's only as big as a tube of lipstick.  Finally, beauty habit sent me a little handwritten note of thanks and a little bag of perfume and lotion samplers with my order.  I can't wait to try the other scents by Crazylibellule and The Poppies and I would definitely shop again with Beauty Habit.

Good Stuff

I absolutely love the smell of Philosophy's Cinnamon Buns.  Like the other reviewers have said, it doesn't last long after the shower but it is a nice way to wake up in the morning.  Even my husband likes it and he is really picky about anything scented.

I only use it as a shower gel and not a shampoo so it lasts pretty long making it worth the expense.  I like the other Cinnamon Buns products also - I use the cream and the lip gloss

This is a sweet treat!  It smells good enough to eat.  It also leaves my skin smooth and soft.  It works good as a shampoo on my thick, wavy hair too.  Cinnamon Buns 3-in-1 is a wonderful product and everyone should buy it.  Totally worth the $dough$.  Ha Ha

Like someone else said, I don't have a problem paying for a high quality beauty item that works as it says it does.  Cinnamon buns has a great lather, smells wonderful when you use it, and makes your skin soft.  

I have used it as a shampoo and the scent lingers a bit longer using it on your hair, but it really doesn't function as well as a shampoo as it does as a shower gel.  For a bubble bath ya have to use so much of it I just can't do it. I find myself counting  the ounces I'm pouring under the faucet and have decided to use it as a treat only.

The smell doesn't last very long, but have found that it does linger longer if you lather, rinse and repeat, like it says on the bottle.  

It's a dollar an ounce.....not sure if I'll try any of the other 'flavors' simply because of the cost

I have very sensitive skin, a thick beard, and must shave daily.  What a hellacious combination! The Art of Shaving for Sensitive Skin is the best shaving cream I have found...and I have been searching far and wide.  As for the rest of their products...eh, I could take them or leave them...i.e. there are similar products you can acquire much cheaper.
This shaving cream in particular has no alcohol and all kinds of natural ingredients including a bunch of non-comudegenic (sp?) oils that really protect your skin.

I have mixed feelings about Philosophy products.  For one thing they have really done a number on my skin as far as drying certain areas of my skin out.  On the other hand, I use to have a very congested skin and nose area but I have noticed a HUGE difference in the congestion of my skin when using When Hope is NOt enough serum.  I haven't noticed any lifting but the line between my eyebrows has softened.  As far as reducing facial hair growth don't count on it.  I am only giving this 4 stars because even though it has helped keep my congestion under control, it hasn't done much more than that and I think it is a bit pricy for being just an exfoliator

Philosophy products have really changed my skin, and I know this is true because the times I have run out of Philosophy products and replaced them with even very expensive department store brands, my skin starts breaking out and looking blotchy, uneven and tired.  Then I remember how much Philosophy does for me, and I absolutely have to reorder.  If you buff your face with the microdelivery peel, wash thoroughly with "Purity Cleanser", then follow with this product, "When Hope Is Not Enough Serum" then "Hope in a Jar" moisturizer on your entire face and neck, your skin will just glow, and you will be amazed how fast blemishes and blotches just go away and don't come back!  After using the microdelivery peel, my skin looks 75% better right away.  After a week of using all the products, my skin is clear and glowing.  I really believe in these products.  They feel great, smell great and work great

This products delivers what it promises.  I bought it as part of the Makeup Optional Kit and now I am ordering 2 so that I don't run out.  My skin is missing it so badly.  I discovered good skin I never knew I could have so I must have this product.  The antioxidants really deliver and roll back the years to reveal younger skin.  This is my favourite, then secondly the Purity made simple, third the Hope is not Enough SPF cream

I have been on the search for a new makeup and have been disappointed in so many, so I have been pleasantly surprised with how much I like the Pur Minerals. I sets nicely and I don't feel "made up". I like that there are no chemicals in it as I have pretty sensitive skin. This is not a heavy makeup so if you're looking for max coverage this is not for you. I love the mineral glow too. It gives me the perfect glow without looking fake. I will be buying this again

I recently converted to using powder makeup.  I am hooked. I didn't tell anyone I was using it.  My son was the first person to tell me how nice I looked!  That truly made my day and was all the convincing I needed.  I absolutely love it because it is flawless and does not feel "goopy" like liquid foundation

This Pur Minerals Starter Kit is a great introduction to this brand.  I am absolutely in love with the 4-in-1 Pressed Mineral Makeup (included in the kit). It's so much better than the Bare Escentuals makeup, which I had been using for years. The 4-in-1 provides great coverage, as it is a foundation, concealer, and spf 15 pressed powder all in one. With Bare Escentuals, I was having to buy the mineral veil, foundation and concealer all separately, and I still felt like my dark circles and blemishes were not covered well. Pur Minerals is a wonderful makeup, very lightweight, and even the brush is soft on my skin! I highly recommend it

Having been blessed with very large pores on my nose and cheeks I was looking for something that might help reduce the appearance of my pores.  They seem to enlarge as I age. Came across this product somewhat by accident. I was really amazed at how well it works. Just a small dollop tapped lightly on the skin and your pores vanish and your skin looks perfectly smooth. It mattifies the skin all day (and I have extra oily skin). Other Clinique products have made my skin break out, but this stuff is wonderful if you suffer from acne on your nose or cheeks. Highly recommended

This is the best shaving product in the whole wide world.  If you exfoliate first and then use it, nothing gets smoother legs for me &amp; my sensitive skin. Yes, it seems kind of expensive but you just need a tiny bit at a time in a thin layer so it actually lasts longer for me than several bottles of regular shave gel.  It also takes up less space

I bought this as a gift for my head-shaving husband. He is very happy with his close shave, and I have used it as well for my legs. A tiny bit goes a long way, and it provides a very close, smooth shave. The downside is the cost; it's hard to justify that much for an everyday shaving gel.

This product works very well on my fair nordic and sensitive skin. It covers well, but with a light, non-oily feeling, and combined with a fluff og powder, it leaves my skin looking flawless. I highly recommend this product.

I'm not a big perfume girl.  I mean, I love the pretty bottles and tend to store up the really antique (or antique-y looking) ones.  But I generally prefer essential oils over perfume.  That said, out of the dozens that I own, I keep three on hand at all times.  (Four if you count the little mini I got from SpaceNK)

Santa Maria Novella for rubbing on my ankles. I know it's a bit mature but it reminds me of Italy.  And monks.  
Chanel Mademoiselle because my mother always taught me to love Chanel and I just prefer that scent to the others. 
And Marc Jacobs because, to be honest, if I had to choose the loveliest, this would be it.  It's lovely and light.  Not too over powering.  Affordable.  And gets tons of compliments.  

Also comes in cute bottle.  :

If I had to choose a fragrance that was THE most feminine I've ever smelled, it would be Marc Jacobs.  Yes, it's a gardenia based scent, but definitely not your typical musty, heavy gardenia by any means.  Marc Jacobs is different in that it is a 'wet gardenia', like you're smelling a bunch of gardenias that have been swirling around in a bowl of fresh water.  Intoxicatingly alluring.

The notes of this fragrance are: Gardenia, Wild Muguet, Skin Musk, Cedar, Ginger.  The gardenia in this is faint, but lovely.  It isn't a knock-you-out strong gardenia, but very mellow and mesmerizing.  It'll follow you like a breath of fresh air, and you'll have people sniffing the air you leave behind. :)  If you've ever smelled Michael by Michael Kors, this is DIFFERENT.  Michael is not gardenia, but it is a tuberose scent.  It is very strong, creamy, heavy, and thick.  If you like Michael, you may like Marc Jacobs as your spring/summer alternative.  They're in the same family in terms of florals and such, but different in terms of how they wear.  Marc Jacobs being flowy, and Michael being heavy.  

The 1.7 oz. retails at $65, and the 3.4 oz. at $85.  It's quite expensive, but it does have that brand-name smacked on the front. :)  I think it's worth it.  The lasting power is decent.  Even when you may feel it is gone, it's not, and people will compliment you.

Try it out and see how you like it on your skin

My husband and I sat next to a woman on our flight to Prague who smelled absolutely delicious.  A asked her what fragrance she was wearing, and she replied Marc Jacobs.   I remember it was fresh and clean, and subtly floral without being overly sweet.  

 Now -  6 months later -  I came across it in Lord &amp; Taylor, sprayed a tester on my wrist, and instantly remembered why the fragrance was so captivating.   Without more than 30 seconds of contemplation I purchased the gift set - can't wait to experience this fresh, winning scent over and over again.

For a long time I avoided anything with gardenia like a plague-it always smelled too sickly sweet to me. This perfume changed my mind completely-yes, there is gsrdenia but its very light and fresh and unlike any gardenia you've ever smelled. Try it for yourself

My boyfriend used to search online stores for the French cologne Jean Patou pour Homme because it was the only "upscale" cologne he would wear (It was awesome!). However, it is not produced anymore and is very hard to find and very expensive. He searched high and low to find a replacement, and this is it!

Sean John Unforgivable is surprisingly good. Masculine, but not too musky or cheap smelling. Now, this is all my boyfriend will wear - and I'm not complaining!

Guys - women will love how you smell when you wear this. Women - buy this for your boyfriends/husbands, but only let them wear it when they're on a date with you! :)

Anyway, it's worth the cost, and it's our new favorite.

I have to say that I was quite impressed with this fragrance. I tend to look the other way when a product receives a little too much hype or attention. I can't say that this cologne is worth a great deal of hype, but I can say that it has a pleasant and 
disctinctive odor.

The cologne is not something you would wear on a daily basis, but would go very well with a suit on a special occasion. 

On the bad side, along with the cologne's elegant odor comes a slightly feminine aroma. While I am not one to prefer a "musky" cologne I could do without smelling like a woman. An additional downside would be it's high cost per ounce... 

Overall, since receiving the cologne as a gift, I am quite pleased with adding this fragrance to my collection. Good job Diddy Daddy Puff...

I have NEVER smelled any cologne as good as this. Unforgivable is absolutely wonderful! I saw diddy on several talk shows promoting this fragrance and thought here we go... another famous person in the perfume industry - not gonna be any good. So I go shopping the other day and see a tester bottle. I had to try it. sprayed it on the little piece of paper and immediately asked the sales clerk to give me the biggest bottle they had. It is amazing. My boyfriend comes home from work, I present him with the cologne and he wasn't thrilled (not into colognes and such), but promises to try it anyway. He didn't hate it!!! And that's about as thrilled as he gets about anything, so I knew then it was a good thing. I just can't quit smelling him, his clothes, his car - everything smells Unforgivable! We went out with some friends for dinner and drinks and both of my girlfriends pulled me aside to ask what cologne he was wearing - they wanted to buy it for their guys too! Now I can't wait for the women's fragrance to come out... SeanJean DEFINITELY has a winner here

Lush makes a few products with lemon, but I think this is one of the best because it has coconut oil for deep conditioning and it is a little intoxicating with the scent of Vetivert. 

The earthy fragrance may appeal to your wilder side if you enjoy the Jungle conditioner which also contains Vetivert oil. Use this conditioner after the Daddy-O shampoo and all you can imagine you are walking through fields of lavender drinking a coconut milkshake. 

I can also recommend the Honey Trap Lip Balm and the Smitten Hand Cream. "All that Jas" is also a wonderful product for the bath.

when I first got the package delivered to me at work, my assistant and I were smelling all the products... this one made both of us scrunch our noses in distaste. But when I got home and actually applied it to my hair, it smelled nothing like the nasty old lady smell I had detected before. The reason why I have given this product 5 stars, is because I feel that this conditioner has been unfairly graded here. The conditioner is for people with curly or processed hair -- meaning, if you have straight, thick hair, this conditioner may seem like a waste of money due to the amount of product you have to apply. Also, as us girls with curly hair know, not all curly hair is equal. Some have thick, springy curls that gets curlier the shorter the cut it, while others have a thinner quality to their hair which actually gets curlier the longer it gets. I'm the later, and I think this is why this product works for me. I can understand how this may seem misleading to those with the thicker curl types, but I'm here to set the record straight on that one. I hope it helps in deciding if this product is right for you

I really like this conditioner from Lush. I wash my hair everyday, and because of this (and long soaks in the bath) my hair gets pretty dry. This conditioner is absorbed really quickly and doesn't have an overpowering scent. I am not a huge fan of coconut, but this and the shampoo makes my hair smell like a tropical cocktail which I think is really nice. I wouldn't use it every day and don't recommend it unless you have dry hair that needs a bit of extra care. I have used American Cream but I think Coolaulin is better, at least for my hair. I have thick, straight, mid-length hair. Great conditioner to make hair soft but strong, and also shiny

I really enjoyed this bomb - it was very refreshing and relaxing. It is a big bomb and I could have broken it in half  but I didn't want to risk missing a thing! So far I have been happy with my Lush purchases and my favorite bomb is Sex Bomb, but I would buy this one again or give it as a gift

After suffering from a terrible cold all week I finally succumbed to a hot bath. I had to rummage through my box filled with Lush products ( gift from a thoughtful boyfriend) when I pulled out this huge disc and broke out half while saving the other for one more bath. I didn't even know what this was called but the minute it touched the water, refreshing and invigorating essences of lemons and milky cream escaped my nose, I felt happy in an instant, it was amazing! Even thought my nose refused to recognize scent for days I smelled the oils and citrusy botanicals, the bath water filled with tiny bubbles and I soaked my cold and stress away. 

After the bath I felt great, my skin and bones felt refreshed and I was warm, cozy and felt a lot better. After looking it up online I was really surprised to see that this was called The Happy Pill, because it really did make me happy. I am really looking forward to using the other half, hopefully when I'm not sick anymore. Once again Lush came through for me with the products they so lovingly create and I cannot recommend their bath bombs enough. Whether taken as a fun bath product or to relieve cold or sadness they always work in gentle and relaxing ways.

The main ingredients in this little love ball are good skin nourishers such as Olive oil, Hemp oil, Grapefruit oil, Bergamot oil, Frankincense oil, Lemon oil, Grange Flower Absolute, Mandarin oil, Gardenia Extract ( yum!) and sodium bicarbonate.

Happy Bathing!

- Kasia S.

Olive oil moisturizes while grapefruit, lemon oil and mandarin orange oil refresh. This is a large foaming bath treat that looks like a big fizzy orange vitamin pill that you put in water. It seems to foam slowly and eventually I broke it into pieces to help the process along. It kept fizzing and foaming creating tiny orange and yellow islands within the bubbles (I added some bubble bath first - you might want to try some Happy Hippy shower gel). 

Eventually the water turned creamy (olive oil and hemp oil) and this bath reminded me of a creamsicle. Bergamot, orange flower and gardenia also make this a beautiful calming bath that leaves you in a good mood. 

This bath is fun with the Lemslip Buttercream. I keep applying some "Whoosh" temple balm to my wrists and happily inhaling deeply. This bath made me feel warm and snuggly and in the mood for lemon meringue pie or lemon sugar cookies or lemon tea. 

This is a good bath for the morning or evening, depending on your mood. I was drinking Celestial Seasonings Tension Tamer Extra with this LUSH experience. If you love "Happy Hippy" shower gel, this fun bath product will impress you.

I tried the apple cider clarifying shampoo on a reccomendation from a saleswoman at Sephora.  I have never been happier with a shampoo.  I have fine/ oily hair and product buildup is a problem for me.  After using this, it felt like I just left a salon.  My hair was shiny, squeaky clean, it had body and was sooo soft.  I also got several comments from people at work about how good my hair smelled. I only use it about once a week, not only to conserve (it is pretty pricey per ounce), but also it's clarifying so I don't want to dry out my scalp (this has happened to me before).  So I shampoo and condition with other products during the week

Much better in terms of coverage than the new Loreal makeup that Diane Keaton touts, which is more creamy but just doesn't cover as well.  Avon's mousse foundation goes on almost like a powder but doesn't block my pores.  I highly recommend it

This product blended well into my skin, and I forget that I was wearing makeup. What is amazing about Avon is that their products are very economical and yet is of very high quality. I am usually acne-prone so I am careful about what I use on my face. It is not oily and yet even dry skins can use it. It is very matte and can be worn alone

This stuff smells awesome.  I have it on my bathroom sink and it makes my whole bathroom smell like candy.  I haven't used it yet because I love the smell so much and I don't want it to go away.  I just ordered a bunch though, so I will try it out.  They are really pretty too.  If I was a kid and didn't know any better I would probably try to eat it

If you love baths, but simply must have bubbles, then the bubble bars can be a lovely addition to a salt soak. You can also add one of these or half of a bubble bar along with one of the bath bombs. I keep buying the bath bombs and giving them away as gifts, which is an excuse to buy more lush products! 

I've tried numerous bubble bath products and these seem to produce an especially fun amount of bubbles. You can literally hide below the bubbles, there are so many. You also get the added benefit of more essential oils. With Lush products, you may have to get a journal just for bath bliss experiences. There are certain products you can blend together to create moods and moments.

This is my favourite Lush bubble bar. It makes lots of bubbles and is good for 2 very decadent baths. It can be divided into 3 or even 4 baths, but I like lots of bubbles so I usually divide into 2 baths. It smells like vanilla candy and is wonderful. The smell usually lingers a lot longer in the bathroom than it does on me. I have a dark blue tub so can't really see if the water changes colour. I think if it does, it can only be a faint pink. It has a strong smell but I think that's part of why I love it so much. The candy flower on top can be pink, blue, yellow, or white. If you like this I would also recommend you try Melting Marshmallow Moment, which is a bath melt (ie no bubbles) but it's also really yummy, and a lot more skin-softening. This can also be divided into at least 2 baths, and still be indulgent

This powder provides excellent coverage without being thick.  (Thick powder base is horrible - it always looks like you dunked your face in a bowl of flour.) My freckles are still there, but my skintone is more even.  It did its job of concealer very well - no red spots, no dark circles - and it works very well as a foundation/powder.  Much better than any other powder foundation I've ever used.  Come to think of it, much better than any liquid foundation I've ever used

China Glaze is my favorite polish, but perhaps it's because they are the only ones I've ever seen with this color #86, Your Touch. It's so gorgeous, I've had compliments on it nearly every place I go. China Glaze seems to have limited retail distribution, so I've had to order it online for years - and this vendor was perhaps the best ever in sending it out so quickly! Great job

I bought this because I wanted a primer for make up, but have acne prone skin and felt that most other primers would make me break out, as some reviews have stated. Initially I did break out a little, but I kept using it becuase the rest of my skin looked so great and felt so smooth. After a week the breakouts went away (they were minor) and all I can say is WOW. My skin looks so much better, my make up looks better, I look better without make up, etc. etc. I use it with Complete Me powder foundation and I have never in all my 38 years been happier with a pair of products.

I LOVE this stuff!  I have "my mother's hands" as my sister calls them.  As the years go by they're getting more and more wrinkly and I also have age spots.  I gave some to my sister last year and now she's got me buying it too!

This hand cream makes my hands smooth and silky feeling without being greasy.  It's also improved the condition of my cuticles in only a few applications.  

I'd highly recommend it to anyone who has dry hands and cuticles.  You'll love it too

I am highly sceptical myself when it comes to skincare products.  I received this as a gift after trying the mask of magnaminty (also good).  I was blown away by how this product made my skin feel.  I have used every product under the sun and am a regular proactiv customer.  This scrub was great for my oily skin and left it feeling really clean and soft.  I am totally hooked!  You will love it too...totally worth the money

The best thing about this product is that there is a numbing agent.  Apply and leave on the skin for about 20-30 seconds and then your skin begins to numb slightly, then you start shaving.  It's great because you don't feel the razor on the skin as much; which makes shaving quite pleasant. 

I've searched for other shaving cream on the market with this numbing feature and the closest is Anthony Logistics which I don't think as nice as Philosophy Common Man.

A little goes a long way when you shave and so the tube lasts quite long. I would buy this again...

I received this product as a X-Mas gift this year. I really do like it, considering the last two Philosophy products I did not care for (The Gingerbread Man Bodywash and Amen Cologne). Out of the tube, it's a little thick, but you only need a thin layer to do the trick. It offers up a nice smooth shave, and my skin feels soft and moisturized afterward. Definitely a keeper..

When you buy this perfume for your girlfriend, don't tell her it was under 40 dollars!  I don't know why people make a big deal over expensive perfume.  Yeah, like it really smells better just because it's more expensive.  Anyway, Sarah Jessica Parker perfume has a really nice scent that you'll want to smell over and over.  It's nice that you don't have to spend a lot of money on it either.  Add just a touch for proper use

I got the Gift Box.  I love it.  It smells very modern and you can layer it with a sugar or a vanilla to make your own blend.  It smells "money" - because it is so sophisticated - I love how it wears, it gets nicer as the evening goes on.  I like that in a scent.

Once again, spending a little more money for a product that does what it advertises is WORTH it. This is the only toner I have ever used that completely diminishes oil and shininess without over-drying my skin. I alternate with #3 depending on the weather

If you're like me and your scalp itches like crazy after you get your color done, Nioxin System Scalp Therapy is the answer. (The numbers only represent the type of hair you have, use a lower number if your hair is more fine.)

Use this once or two times after color, and the scalp itch goes away. 

The product claims to help thinning hair. I have no issue with that, and I think I found an "off-market" use for the product, but it works for me so I'll take it

This is a really fun gift for children (although, you might have guessed that I like them too), it has a sweet fruity scent without being a sugar buzz and the colors are very bright and cheerful.

I would suggest one of those wire or slotted soap dishes to help these dry easier and faster though. A regular soap dish without any type of draining makes it melt faster

Whenever I saw glass or porcelain nail files in stores I always thought they were overpriced, you can get all kinds of nail files for a couple of bucks, and I didn't see a reason to pay more.  But I was given one of these and now I think it's worth it.  It is a really strong file, so strong that my mother was startled by how much it took off the first time she used it.  You really only need very gentle pressure and speed with this type of file.  It is very easy too clean and shows no signs of wear, by this time I usually would have killed a normal file

I wasn't crazy about this mascara when I first put it on but it grew on me. The brush is not a regular mascara brush and it took a little getting used to however I love it now. It brushes the clumps right off your lashes as you apply. They'll be long and nicely separated. And the stuff stays on your lashes like glue all day. No smearing and it still looks perfect at the end of the day to the point where I feel like it's a shame to wash my eye makeup off. I'm really pleased with it. I want to try Lancome's new mascara too but this one is definitely a keeper.

Mistral, as many know, is a powerful, gusty wind that blows across the south of France. Mistral, as I was happy to discover, is also the name of a line of bath and body products, all French inspired, all lusciously lovely from scented soaps to soothing lotions to rejuvenating body butters. 

Matthew Tilker, founder and president of Mistral, utilizes Shea butter, which is an efficacious natural healer, in a myriad of must-have forms. Derived from the nuts of the African Shea Tree (according to sacred custom the nuts are harvested primarily by women), this butter is highly emollient, a boon for those with dry skin, chapped lips, any number of skin irritations. 

The pure Shea Butter soap comes in a plethora of inviting fragrances, all milled six times (while others boast being triple milled). South Seas is a particular favorite - it's as fresh as an ocean breeze and as calming, soothing as a tropical island. The marine scent is accented with a touch of grapefruit, white flowers and soft woods. An irresistible combination. 

South Seas is a fragrance with which you wish to surround yourself - made possible by the shower gel, body lotion, massage bath and body oil, bath salts and candle all available at very accessible prices.

The pores of the face become clogged with makeup, cremes, sunscreens, Bronzing Gels, Powders, etc.  

Exfoliation, washing, facials, steaming DO NOT REMOVE BLACKHEADS, WHITEHEADS AND CLOGGED PORES.  

This simple product gets them out!  

Buying one will last a life time.  No need to buy another ever....

I can't say enough good about this lipstick.  I am a Black woman with a light-skinned golden brown complexion, like Halle Berry.  When I received the Malibu Peach my first impression was that it was too light and that my lips were going to look ashy.  However, when applied it is the perfect smooth sheer soft peach color.  It's a very rich product and the case is elegant. It doesn't have that funky smell or taste that a lot of lip products do and it's not sticky!!  I love MAC but if my hair blows into my face it sticks to my lips (eww).  Big ups to Mally! (thumbs that is..lol) I will definitely be trying some other Mally products.  I also ordered the brow kit in Sable which is first rate

I have used Philosophy products for over a year now and am a proponent of their exfoliators and cleansers.  I enthusiastically bought The Present after seeing it as a new product at the Nordstrom counter.

The bottle says that it is clear makeup for fine lines, wrinkles, and uneven texture.  It can be used three different ways; alone as an oil-free moisturizer for sensitive skin; over oil free moisturizer (such as Hope in a Jar) to create the illusion of airbrushed skin; and under foundation for a smooth finish.

I was after that airbrushed skin, and this product works GREAT if used over moisturizer.  It truly does minimize pores and fine lines. If you don't like to wear a lot of makeup, it gives you a very fresh and natural look.  

Unfortunately, no matter how diligent your are, sometimes blemishes pop up and you have to use foundation.  The Present was not suitable in this function for me.  Used under my foundation, my makeup felt cakey, thick, and the foundation did not blend well into this product.  It left unsightly foundation streaks that were difficult to correct.  I could not hold my MAC foundation responsible, because used alone it does not exhibit any of these qualities.

I would highly reccomend this product as "clear makeup" but not as a foundation primer as indicated on the back of the bottle.  If you are looking for a foundation primer, I would reccomend Smashbox's Photo Finish.  It is extremely lightweight, blends well with foundation, and the bottle will last forever because you use such small amounts.

I was given this product as a gift, and I just love it.  I'll often wear it on weekends without any additional makeup.  It smoothes this skin surface.  True - the coverage is not the same as with a tinted foundation - but it offers a lot of improvement worn alone.  Also, I was using a tinted cream makeup base that was not working well on my dry skin.  It would create lines, etc.  So I started combining the two things - the tinted cream base and the Philosophy skin perfector together on a sponge before applying and BINGO - This solved the problem.  So if you want a tint plus the smoothness, you might want to give this a try.

I have been using this powder for about 5 years. It is amazing. I have problems with red cheeks and breakouts. Once I put on my concealer and foundation, I put on this powder and it is truly what makes my imperfections disappear. It even comes with the perfect application brush. This powder is worth every penny because it does what a powder should do

I first tried Amazing Grace a couple of years ago.  At that time I had a dresser full of department store colognes.  The scent of Amazing Grace is somehow undescribable.  Suffice it to say, it is the "perfect" fragrance, and those other scents are history.  It is pleasing to the person who wears it, and is pleasing to someone just walking by you.  Some perfumes walk into a room before the person does, or is so strong it makes other people's eyes water.  We've all been around someone like that. Not so with Amazing Grace. It is just in harmony with you and those around you

I hardly ever wore a fragrance until I received Amazing Grace as a Christmas present.  I love it.  It is clean and sensual.  Whoever says this smells like a granny must have a strange sense of smell.  There's nothing granny about it.  It is never overpowering

I TOTALLY disagree with the reviewers that say it smells strong and like a granny! I don't know what they're smelling, but obviously it's not this. It does smell a little stronger at first than it does when the fragrance has settled in, but it certainly doesn't smell like any granny I've ever smelled. I always get compliments when I wear this fragrance (which is every day)- complete strangers will come up to me and tell me how good I smell. I recommend starting with the body emulsion and then lightly spritzing the fragrance (1 spray should do the trick).

A spearmint top note, a lemon middle, and a clean bottom. Patrick wore this (yes, it's great on manly men too) when we ran a half marathon last week and my nose followed him all the way to the finish line. A truly unusual and pleasurable scent. It's green, but not in the obvious chypre leafy modern sense like Chanel's Crystalle. Nope, this is mint like julep. I've never been the biggest Guerlain fan--I've left the Shalimar-isms to my grandmother, who is ravissante in those old fashioned Orientals...but Guerlain's splendid Aqua Allegoria line--which includes Herba Fresca and the equally divine Pamplelune (a grapefruit and chamomile burst), among others--is truly fresh. I get lots of compliments when I wear Herba Fresca

	Ever notice how many good things are juicy?  Juicy steaks.  Nothing tastes better, even though the price can be outrageous.  Juicy gossip.  Really, you can tell me; I never, ever repeat what I'm told!  

	Ah, and then there's the fresh, frisky, fruity "I Love Juicy" shampoo from Lush!

	This is a thick, rich jelly shampoo that absolutely whisks away city dirt or country soil with a dollop and one shampoo.  Infused with mango, pineapple, kiwi and papaya it not only leaves hair squeaky clean, but also smelling divine with an appealing fruity scent.  Give those perfumed shampoos to a rival (she'll be stunned when you're nice to her) and go for the fresh!

	Let me know how much you love Juicy.  Oh, and if you've heard something juicy - send it along.   Remember, I won't tell a soul!

If you have dry skin on your feet these socks are fantastic.  I place mine in the microwave for 15 seconds while I apply moisturizer to my feet.  Slide the socks onto your feet as soon as the microwave is finished.  In 15 minutes you have a quick, but effective moisturizing treatment.  If your feet are really dry you could do the same thing but leave them on overnight.  I found the overnight option to be a little warm on my feet.  But, it might work fine for you.

These socks are 94% cotton and 6% Spandex.  They can be machine washed and tumbled dried.  I have not found it necessary launder them each time I use them.  I use a light moisturizer (Kerasal), so you might have a different experience if you use a heavier product to moisturize.

I would highly recommend this product.

I have frosted hair that is generally on the dry side.  The problem with most conditioners I've tried is that if they are good enough to get out the knots in my hair and soften it, they are very heavy and weigh my hair down.  I found out about Kerastase at my beauty parlor and can only get it there or at Amazon.  It's wonderful, doing everything I need, including making my hair nice and shiny, without the heaviness.  I recommend it highly

I've suffered most of my life from the "dark circle" syndrome. It's become much worse at nearly 35 years old with FOUR kids! A dear friend in the industry (my personal guru!) recommended this. It is NOTHING short of AMAZING! I wear it with just a tinted face lotion (foundation makes our wrinkles stand out as I now know) and once in a while a quick dust of bare minerals clear mineral veil. My husband commented (in only two days, which is a RECORD for him) that I must have slept well because my face looked so good. This stuff is SOOOO worth the price. I'll NEVER be without it again!

I am very glad with my purchase. It gives a subtle natural glow to skin not a tacky shiny one. I am usually not very comfortable with wearing foundation and I prefer tinted moisturizers. Happy Light gives even complexion without being heavy. It also offers sun protection, SPF 15. If you don't need more than medium coverage, it is worth considering this brand.

I've been wearing Philosophy's Falling in Love as a regular fragrance and liked it so much that I decided to give some of their other products a try... Pure Grace has been a lovely find! I spray a little on a blouse or jacket and have that lovely fresh-washed scent lingering all day. It compliments the Falling in Love scent nicely, as both are fairly light, but I love it on its own as a nice change of pace as well. So far it has been just as advertised-- clean, soapy and crisp-- and I'd add that it's just one of the most comforting smells around... makes me want to curl up in a pile of warm towels fresh from the dryer and take a little nap

I have been searching for what seems like forever for a nice cologne or perfume that is not all flowery and overpowering. Now I have finally found it! I love this scent! It just smells so clean and fresh. I'm so glad I tried it! The first couple times I wore it, I received compliments and questions about what was I wearing. That never happened to me before. So I went and purchased the lotion and shower cream too. The only bad thing about it is that, like many others have said, the smell doesn't last too long and so I keep reapplying it. Maybe now that I have the lotion too, the smell will last longer. I would highly recommend trying this fragrance. I think you will love it

The charcoal in this soap acts as a sort of rasp for exfoliating dead skin cells. The licorice extract soothes and rehydrates. This is a very good soap if you have minor break-outs or oily skin. If you are very sensitive, you might want to try Fresh Farmacy instead (it has calamine lotion.)

Wowzers!

I am a 26 year old male with skin from the devil. It's so oily that only two minutes out of the shower my nose is already greasy. I have been using Fresh Farmacy 1x or 2x daily for the past two months or so and have been thouroughly impressed. A week ago I bought a bar of Coalface out of curiosity. I had read about it on the LUSH website and was somewhat skeptical. I was told at the store that Fresh Farmacy would be the better bet for my kind of skin, and I figured the slightly higher pricetag on the FF meant that it was better than Coalface. Now, having used Coalface for the past week, I can say for sure that my skin feels cleaner and tighter with Coalface than it generally has with FF.

I'm not about to toss out my remaining FF of course! It lasts forever and I probably have another 6 or 7 months of it left. I find it to be a great skin cleanser. So far, though, I think Coalface is the better choice for me.

Give this stuff a try

I recieved a sample of this bar with a large shipment of Lush products I ordered around Christmas, I gave most of the products as gifts so I full enjoyed the Samples no matter how freaky they sounded I loved this bar it smelled clean and was fun to use and even though I have combination skin that usually is dry that time of year, I did not notice any drying out and it cleared all problem areas up especially black heads! I strongly recomend this bar for any one with any problem areas. I wish I could talk more of my friends into using Lush products because their simply is the perfect miracle product for everyone to be found among them. And how fabulous are those bath products simply heaven

I love Auqolinas first and ground breaking perfume "Pink Sugar"  to death but it is such an overpowering scent that I am often smelled before I am seen and perhaps such a strong sweet scent isnt always appropriate.

Aquolinas new perfume "Chocolovers" is similarly sweet, but much subtler.

If you love the sweet scent of Pink Sugar but don't like how you can be smelled from 12 feet away, try Chocolovers

I bought this, mostly because of how obsessed I am with Pink Sugar.  This product smells sweet.  It smells like you rubbed yourself with a box of truffles before you left the house.  I personally think of this as a good thing- I love candy/food scents.  My perfume collection is such that I am suprised I'm not followed everywhere I go by a swarm of bees.  

If you're looking for a sophisticated scent, please don't buy this, or Pink Sugar.  If you are looking to have people ask, "Hey, do you smell a delicious cake?" everytime you walk past...buy away.  And who doesn't want to smell like a delicious cake?

'Don't know what these others are talking about. Chocolovers smells yummy!  What's great about this fragrance is that it's not overwhelming and it's not going to make you smell like dessert. It's got chocolatey tones but it's not just about chocolate; It's warm and musky with orange oil, hazlenut, vanilla...  If in doubt, you can always go to Sephora and try a sample first (see Sephora.com for store locations)

This is the very BEST hairstyler and hair dryer in one! I have very fine, thick, shoulder lenght hair and was a little skeptical that this product would be usefull for me. It is! Actually it is the best hair styling product I have ever purchased. It dries and sets my hair very quickly, usually in five minutes or less. What a timesaver. I am so delighted with this product that I purchased eight (8) to keep in my closet so I don't have to hunt for the best product EVER!!!

This is really good smelling cologne.  I hardly use it anymore though because of its current popularity. Gio may be the most popular cologne out there.  I would much rather be original than one of the herd.  You'll have to make the decision yourself be original or smell like everyone else

Giorgio Armani is know for his excellence and fineness when it comes to his clothing, accessories, bags and of course: Fragrances. Acqua di Gio is remarkable, distinguished, and flawless in every sense. It has been the best-selling cologne since its release and has become synonymous with sexy. 99% of people (men and women) who come in contact with you on the daily basis will compliment you on your smell (at least in my case.) I'm not complimented on any cologne I own more than this one so I usually wear it when I know I'll be in contact with more than a few people. This fragrance is truly awe-inspiring and it proves once again that when it comes to delicate scents, Armani is king

I use to be a huge Calvin Klien fan until I came across this product. I've been wearing it since 2000, and have not been without it since.  The ladies, love the scent, which is obvious as I've had women, come up and sniff me in public (Yes, public and then be excused when asking me what brand of cologone I have on).

 Forget bout those axe and tag promo's, in the real world, this is the stuff that get you remembered, not just noticed.

...every home should have some! There is no greater soap for beautiful scent, gentle cleansing and a unique ability to comfort and pamper. A perfect gift and a must in posh, top notch hotels etc. Some scents are universal while others distinctly feminine, either way they are worth a try and well worth the buy

I LOVE Lola lip gloss, it isn't too tacky, lasts a long time, and the colors are gorgeous.  I bought the Fantastica color as a key chain lip gloss several years ago and was so impressed with it that I bought La Petite Menagerie as a replacement.  I love the idea of having it on a key chain, so your never without lip gloss!  All the colors in this kit are great.

This mascara goes on beautifully and looks great, but it's messy. It's more liquid than most mascaras and, when I travel with it, the tube leaks! It also tends to smear when I first put it on, but after it dries, it's good for the day. If you carry mascara with you or travel often, look for another brand

I'm always skeptical of "age defying" products, but this one really works.  I've been using it since it first came out (maybe 10 years?) and people often think I'm younger than I am (27).  I'm not really using it for that though - I use it because it is unreal how good it is with acne.  It prevents breakouts and also heals current pimples SO fast.  When I run out, the breakouts are back

WOW! My husband and I both use this scrub. It is very refreshing. The salt scrub is easy to apply and leaves a nice minty smell in the shower and on the skin for at least an hour! Like the previous review I feel the chill after getting out of the shower...then I was full of energy! I look forward to trying this one after a hot work out or yard work! This will be a staple in our household!

I recieved this as a gift and have always loved other products by Philosophy.  This is GREAT for a hot, sticky day and you want to jump in the shower, exfoliate, and cool off.  The first time I used it, I have to admit I was freezing after my shower!  It has a very strong cooling effect that lasts on the skin for at least an hour. The smell is very natural, not artificial like a few other of Philosophy's 3in1.  It's a combo of mint and wintergreen..  I would compare it to their Candy Cane scent.  I've been using it reguarly after workouts &amp; it's great!!  A nice cool down

I recently realized that while my wife spends hundreds on high quality skin care products for us, I was still using throw away razors.  I recently received a Fusion razor and loved that, until I went to replace the blades.  $4+ a piece, and they last no longer than any other blade.  So, I got online and researched shaving and what I learned was that, though there have been advances in shaving technology, nothing has been improved, only made more expensive.  I learned my dad was right; all it takes for a great shave is a good safety razor, a decent brush, shaving soap and a mug.

I received my razor a couple of days ago and now, I wake up eager to take a shower and shave.  Nothing has ever cut this close without giving me razor burn.  My skin is sensitive and I have had no problems with that since getting this amazing razor.  It was worth the price, too, because it is the same cost as 4 sets of Fusion replacements.  The replacement blades for this razor are fifty cents a piece and do a far better job.  

I have read reviews for this razor by people who, apparently, weren't trained to shave.  This razor will not cut against the grain.  Also, the handle is weighted, so you have to allow the razor to do all the work, or you run the real risk of filleting your face.  Be patient.  A great shave takes a little more commitment than just breaking out a can of foam and a disposable razor.  Let the razor do the work.  I assure you, even if it takes a few days to get the technique down, you will be thrilled with this razor.

The nicest feature of this amazing razor is that it allows you to adjust the closeness of the blade. I learned that most people like it between one and one and a half.  Mine is set at one and a half and it gives me a perfect shave every time. Until now, I didn't know that such a thing was even possible.  Happy shaving

The quality and workmanship is top notch! The price is high for a razor, but it will take you less than a year to break even if you are buying cartriges like the Gillette Fusion at $4 a pop! And it will last you a lifetime.  Replacement blades for the razor run about 50 cents each and last a hole lot longer! I was only getting 4-5 shaves from a Fusion blade, but I can shave my face and head for at least 2-3 weeks on a single safey razor blade :) Even if I changed the blade after every shave it would still cost less than a fusion. 

It takes some getting used to. I got a few minor nicks when I first started using it, but now I never get any.  I even shave my head with it :)  I've had mine for about 6 months and love it.

I suggest starting out on the #1 setting and work your way up. For me right between 1 and 2 is best, any higher and the shave is too close.

The strawberry milkshake shower gel smells just like Bonomo turkish candy I bought when I was a kid. I like it but I think the shower gel is overrated due to exposure on QVC.  Other shower gels are creamier than this. I'll enjoy using this and the Eggnog then go back to making my own

This is one of my favorites. I love the scent. It doesn't smell like fresh strawberries because it's not supposed to. It's supposed to smell like a strawberry milkshake (and I think they did a good job of it - so this is what I expected). Philosophy does a good job of matching the scent to the name. The only thing I didn't expect was that I still need to condition with another conditioner. I'd say it's a shampoo and shower gel, a 2-in-1, not a 3-in-1

Like I stated in the title, this isn't my FAVORITE three-in-one product from Philosophy.  I have several of their scents, and I really love Cinnamon Buns and some of the chocolatey ones.  

Strawberry Milkshake smells nice, but it is very sweet.  I wouldn't say it smells artifical, but it doesn't smell like fresh strawberries, either.   I have used it as a shampoo/conditioner quite often, and I have no issues with it.  I have fine hair, and it didn't leave me with tangles, like some of the other reviewers have complained about.

i find these soaps to be very good. There are actually 4 different kinds I believe one also for sensitive skin. If someone felt a none clean feeling afterwards,perhaps they are not taking their makeup off with the proper product, or they are using the wrong soap for their skin type. This soap is similiar to DHC soaps from Japan. If they are to drying try using the correct soap. For help I would suggest going to the Clinque counter or ask me.

Everything is fine, except I was a bit irritated by shedding...it leaves bristles on my face, and they get into the razor.  I hope it will pass with time, as other reviewers reported.  Foaming action is very good, and badger bristle is much more pleasent to the touch than boar.

I'll report again on this item in few months

This shaving brush is perhaps the most inexpensive way to get a pure Badger bristle shaving brush. I've now been using it for a year and a half, and it has not shed any real amount of its bristles like the cheaper brushes on the market. The brush head remains densely packed and quite soft. Hopefully, it will remain that way for some time to come. In the meantime, I do enjoy the close and comfortable shaves that are aided by this brush. Because of it, I have sworn off of canned shave gels for every situation except travel. They just can't compare to your average $1.50 cake of shaving soap and this brush. This was a very worthwhile purchase for me

If memory serves, noted designer Giorgio Armani was once quoted as saying that his designs were created not to be noticed but rather to be remembered. A wonderful thought, typifying his always elegant, classic style. It's certainly true of his latest fragrance for men - Black Code. 

This is a subtle, sensual scent with a touch of the oriental found in notes of lemon and bergamot. It's an ultra masculine fragrance, difficult to capture yet impossible to ignore. 

True to Armani's vision, the glass bottle is artfully crafted - a cylinder of the deepest blue. It's gift boxed in the same color with printing in gray and white. Available in 1.7 and 2.5 oz. sprays, Black code is sure to take its place by the side of Armani's always popular Gio and Mania.

after buying some lush products from here, i went into the lush store in pasadena where the staff was awesome and totally helpful. after explaining my horrendous hair issues, they gave me some samples of rehab, retread and big and i bought a bottle of american dream. they all work wonderfully. rehab made my scalp tingly and my hair felt so soft. my hair has literally never felt better. i HIGHLY recommend rehab or any lush products for that matter

One sudsy washing of your hair seems enough, but you may be tempted to wash your hair again. The suds in the Lush products are especially sensuous and fun. Baths and Showers have never been as fun as when you use these products. LUSH shampoos and conditioners are above a salon quality and also contain natural ingredients and scents that are beyond deluscious. This shampoo goes a long way so you can use a lot less. 

This shampoo contains seaweed, enzymes for cleaning and essential oils to detoxify your scalp. This product also contains a lovely helping of pineapple, kiwi and mango juice. The peppermint, rose, lavender, almond, rosemary, olive and jojoba oil are especially healing. If there is a more perfect shampoo, I haven't found it. This shampoo is a true dream and contains everything you want for deep cleansing and scalp refreshing.

For softly scented and highly conditioned locks, use this conditioning shampoo and finish off with the American Cream. The entire bathroom will be scented and the fragrance will drift through the house. You will awake the next morning and your hair will still be wonderfully scented with Egyptian musk, honey water, vanilla, sage and lavender.  The conditioner also contains fresh strawberries. 

Also in love with:

I have dry, unmanagable, curly hair and rehab has done wonders for it!

Because all the lush shampoos don't contain any silicones, it takes about one or two weeks for your hair to get used to it. The squeeky feeling described in the other review is because of the lack of silicones, this feeling disappears however when your hair dries up. Since I use Rehab my hair is bouncy, soft and shiny. Especially great in combination with American Cream conditoner (just love that scent!

For some reason chicks dig this aroma. I've tried many clognes over many years but this gets the best reaction. I'm getting more now at the request of several ladies so I decided to write this review. With my luck they'll stop making the stuff now so I'm buying 5 bottles just in case

This is a great mascara, it doesn't get clumpy but it leaves your lashes fuller, longer, and it lasts without flaking or smudging. Well worth the price, which is surprisingly lower than most other department store brands

I received a sample of this mascara (in black) and just love it.  It's perfect for everyday wear as it's not too dramatic and is very long lasting.  In fact, it's so long lasting that I  even took a nap while wearing it and it didn't smudge at all.  I was pleased to find, however, that it came off very easily with my Clinque Rinse-Off Foaming Cleanser, so there was no need for a separate eye-make-up remover.  I have more expensive mascaras than this and they are not as good.  Definitely a great product

I REALLY like using this product. The color powder is very sheer and the shimmer powder adds just a subtle amount of sparkle. I like using this after I have applied a light amount of foundation in place of a powder which normally makes my face look older. The shimmer powder doesn't cake like ordinary powders do and gives my face a fresh look.

Awesome product - best concealer I've ever used.  It is lightweight and does not settle into the under eye "creases" that my almost 50-year-old eyes have.  The pink undertone brightens and lightens.

Yum! Fond childhood memories and sweet almost guilty pleasure is created whenever I use this. It smells wonderful. Deliciously scented bubbles blossom on my mesh sponge. This shower gel cleans well without being harsh to sensitive skin. I don't like it as a shampoo as much. When I do use it to wash my hair, I'm sure to follow up with a conditioner. It's a delightful product and I'm pleased with my purchase

Unless you have super oily skin and cannot tolerate any super moisturizing potions, you shouldn't use this. I have oily/normal skin and find that even this dry lotion is moisturizing enough for me. It is definitely not for dry skins and or sensitive types. Kinerase products are touted for their ultra sensitive ingredients, but beware, this lotion contains retinyl palmitate which can in fact irritate your skin. Though this does seem to deliver some skin smoothing, it is not in my opinion, as good as the cream version which is much better at balancing skin, and does NOT contain the retinyl palmitate. Both are good, but Kinerase Cream is better

OK, here's the deal.
I hate chemicals. 
I am a health nut.
I hate greasy moisturizers.
I love to get the most out of everything I do... you know that NY or 90's philosophy of multi-tasking or "Why do 1 thing when you can do 2"?
The solution is Kinerase... realtively chemically good... if it wipes off on the baby when we hug it's no biggy. 

I think the worst thing in it is Methylparaben... which is in everything, even baby products so whatever... and I can moisturize while I get a serious healthy skin glow on my face that does not quit!

I think it's made for wrinkles but I am not worrying about that yet so I use it for the clear skin glow thing that I have always wanted... the skin of my dreams! 

I barely use skin makeup anymore because my once "icky" skin (that's a clinical term) has been literally TRANSFORMED!

BUY! BUY! BUY! I kid you not... it's worth every penny.

This girl knows what it takes to help you look like JLo or Beyonce' on the street.  I cannot count how many times people have stopped and said how much they liked my makeup and I give all credit to Mally Roncal for her inspiration to help women feel "girly".

I have been using this product for over a year.  Only took a couple of weeks to improve the very thin skin under my eyes. A little goes a long, long way.  One jar lasted me about 4 months using every day.  This product blends into the skin quickly and I use it under make-up.  It calms my skin.  I am happy about this product

What a brilliant package!  It's a squeezebottle with a brush at the end, and has a twist on lid.  No spills, no mess, no disaster.  Love it!

It is easy to apply with the brush.  I have Lava Flow, which is a shimmery pink.  The shimmer is a more obvious than I would like, as it's big flecks of sparkle, but it isn't so bad that it looks like glitter glue.  There is a strong smell and taste, sorta tropical; although it isn't unpleasant, it is powerful.  Kinda reminds me of red Koolaid.  The color is a bright pink when first applied, but simmers down to a medium pink and is rather sheer.  In the container the color looks unwearable, but in reality it isn't dramatic.  

The only drawback is how sticky it feels.  It is less sticky than Mac's Lipglass, but more so than Urban Decay XXX, if that makes sense.  

I got this as a freebie and I'm glad I got to try it.  I would buy it but in a different color

I'm not a makeup or product junkie by any means, but simply can't miss even one day of using my All About Lips. It is a cream (much like a moisturizer) that exfoliates and smoothes your lips and makes them fuller/plumper. It also fills in any lines you may have around the mouth so I recommend using it not only on your lips but also outside the lipline. Although I have been using it twice daily for many years, I believe someone using it for the first time should see results fairly quickly. 

Friends of mine who wear lipstick (I don't) also claim if they use it right before they put on lipstick it makes it go on better and last longer. 

(Apparently you can also use this product as an eye cream to smooth crowsfeet around the eyes, but I havent tried this- I prefer Caudelie eye serum and cream.) 

Simply put, I HIGHLY recommend this product and know you'll see results as I have!

I have used hundreds of kinds of smoothers and conditioners on my thick color-treated hair (it is poofy and rough without any help!)
And this stuff did the trick to make is smooth, lay down and be soft in ONE treatment!!!!!!!!!!!!
Buy this stuff if your hair is coarse and poofy and spilt/damaged! You need this stuff. It smells good, is easy to use (and just use a tiny bit!) and works

First of all, it seems a bit silly to defend the smell of any product, as everyone has different oppinions on this. I happen to love the smell, but I am writing this review to talk about what this product actually does; which is transforms hair. I have naturally curly hair, and awhile back I chopped it all off on a hairdresser's suggestion. When my hair was an inch long, it wasn't hard to fight my hair type. Now that I'm in the process of growing it out, my hair has been pretty annoyed at the contant blow drying, dying, and straightening I have subjected it to. Regardless of the cut, my hair has been limp and fried. After using this product along with Big shampoo, my hair has been absolutely transformed. People have commented on my hair ever since I have started using these wonderful products. Now to the issue of price: before using Lush, I was using bumble and bumble wich goes for 20 bucks a pop, as well as various styling products that ran in the similar price range... since using Lush, I have no need for styling products, therefore making these purchases very economical. I can't say enough great things about this brand

Now let's get its effectiveness out of the way so we can talk about that love it or hate it scent! It is a really thick conditioner and works great every other day or every few days. I have really long hair and this tames it and smoothes my split ends, and it leaves my hair shiny. It isn't greasy at all. 

If you are used to drugstore or salon conditioners, don't judge the effectiveness of any natural conditioner for a month. That is how long it can take for the silicones in mainstream conditioners to leave your hair (silicones are all those things in conditioner that end in "cone", like dimethicone, etc). Detoxing your hair off silicones is well worth it though, my hair is much healthier and shinier without that buildup.

So the scent: It is green, kind of melon and fresh, with a hint of violet (like Bathos, Gratuitous Violets, and Daddyo) to it. It took some getting used to, and when I first got it I thought it smelled of green beans or some vegetable-like smell. But when you use it and rinse it out, you are left with a rich green scent, with the tiniest hint of gently floral violet. 

It isn't for everybody, but if you buy it, give it a chance to work its magic in your hair before you make your judgement, because that lovely violetty smell combined with how well it works makes it kind of addictive. I use it with Daddyo shampoo to enhance that hint of violet and the fresh green scent I get from it. I use it in rotation with American Cream which is a bit lighter

Earlier on I had read all the reviews for Retread. Paying 20 bucks for a conditioner did not quite suit me. However, I have been using it for a month now and I have to say that the reviews were an inadequate discription of the product. Personally, I believe this to be an amazing product. I used it in combination with Big and I believe my hair has never looked better. Retread is a superb conditioner and really does wonders. I have virgin hair, but I do blow dry it ever day so I felt a heavier conditioner was necessary. Since this is a deeper conditioner I would leave it in for 5-10 min or while you do all your other stuff in the shower/bath. My hair was softer than ever afterwards (that could be from Big though) and shined like the sun. This is not an everyday conditioner but works well for once or twice a week (I mainly use it for special occasions, or when I just want to feel pretty!) I highly recommend it and I feel that it works much better than Lush's conditioning treatments. The only issue was the smell. I am not much into the smell of cucumbers and to me that is what it smelled like. However, this could just be a personal attribute as no one else has mentioned this. The product was still amazing though, and I am willing to endure the smell(It fades as the day goes on). My decision about this product is Miracle! Hope this helps!

HI

<review_text>
I just bought Retread Hair Conditioner today from my local LUSH store and tried it tonight.  My hair was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G after I used it.  After I've read all the reviews about the product, I was still a little skepticle, as I've tried many things that had awesome reviews, but just didn't work with my thick coarse hair.  

I shampooed my hair, put in Retread Hair Conditioner, covered my hair with a plastic cap and set a hot towel over it for an hour (dunking the towel in hot water every 15 minutes to 'reheat' it).  Rinsed out the conditioner and didn't use anything else on my hair (I usually have to put in anti-frizz serum).  

The first thing I noticed was the shine... what a HUGE difference.  Even my boyfriend said there was something different, but he couldn't quite figure it out.  Retread Hair Conditioner left my hair super soft too.  And you don't even need to use that much.

Now for the bad....

the smell (that's why it's not 5 stars)!  I know some people say they love it and some people say they hate it, and I really think that's the way it is... you either hate it or love it.  I actully hated it.  My boyfriend took one whiff (and thought it smelled like old soggy towels) and offered to drive me back to LUSH to return it because he thought it was 'old'.  Another reviewer said it smelled like 'barnyard' and I think that's the best way to describe it.  You do get used to it (and luckly the smell fades as your hair dries), but for me, the smell was too much.  

I will buy again because I absolutely love the results, but I will only use Retread Hair Conditioner when I know I will be home the next day to spare others from the smell

It is a very good conditioner. It is light and yet conditioning. but to me it smells like hay or cud or something cowish.  It smells distinctively barnyard.  but I see that many like the smell so maybe it is just me.

Is there anyone who doesn't know the name Sarah Jessica Parker? Okay. Think "Carrie" on TV's enormously successful "Sex and the City." She was the gal who dressed to the nines - always with style and glamour. She brings both of those qualities to her first fragrance, "Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker." 

It's a unique, almost indescribable blend of classicism, chic, and innocence. There's not a scent like it with top notes of fresh Mandarin, Bergamot, Lavender, and Apple Martini. Vibrant and warm it's a fragrance that caresses the senses. 

Middles notes are Patchouli, tender Paper Whites, and luxe Orchid. These are enhanced by bottom notes of irresistible white amber, sensuous cedar, and the very sultry musk. This is a scent I revel in, and enjoy wearing. 

The bottle is, of course, simple and exquisite, curved with polished glass, ultra feminine. 

Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker is a beautiful, dreamy yet quite alive fragrance appropriate for every occasion.

I have sensitive, acne prone, combination skin (oily in the t-zone). I've used various toners for months at a time and this is the first toner that doesn't burn when I use it. It reminds me of a better smelling witchhazel astringent -I used witchhazel as a kid to help prevent my skin from breaking out. It has a nice fruity scent which is great since most toners (especially Clinique) smell like alcohol. I just wish it was a little cheaper! The bottle is pretty big so it will last me for 3 months which makes the price not quite so painful. I use it with the Clarifiance Oil Free Gel Cleanser morning and night

I normally do not like anything with a "sandalwood" scent..but this stuff is absolutely wonderfull!  They are not lying when they refer to it as an "addictive" scent in the description..I got a small sample bottle and fell in love...it is perfect for the winter/fall seasons, not so much for the summer.  It's fun when people ask what I'm wearing and I get to casually say "Prada."  Considering I live in Tennessee most people have no idea what that means..but I still feel special

Rice Bran is the secret to these products and the results are immediately apparent in the texture of your skin. After just one to two uses, you start to notice a sense of calm and order descending upon your formerly sensitive skin. This is especially apparent if you layer the products, first using the cleanser, toner and then the essence and skin creams. If you have oily or combination skin, you may be amazed at how balanced your skin becomes. 

The Skin Essence contains Mulberry that naturally lightens discoloration from sun damage and aging. The antioxidants help to revitalize the skin. This is applied before the cream. Who knew when we were climbing around in mulberry trees staining our fingers and faces as children that one day we would use an extract in a lotion that would heal the skin and lighten our skin. 

Age spots and freckles literally start to disappear or may even slightly whiten more than the surrounding skin so they literally seem to fade away. I noticed this after just a few uses so it is super effective. 

Another reason to use this product is the "super" and I mean super fast healing properties. I was amazed. Put this on any skin irritation and watch it disappear in days. 

These products are so fun to use, I've incorporated them into a little night routine for my husband where I give him an antiaging facial before bed. I saw the results of the products on my skin and wanted to share this secret with him. His skin looked instantly more hydrated and he has dry skin. With my combination skin I've seen great results in balancing and clarity. 

The cleansers are like the champagne of skincare and the rest of the line is equally impressive. These are sort of out of my price range if I they didn't last so long and were not so effective. You only need such a small amount so in the end, it will be very economical and the results are superior to other products I've tried. The products also seem to encourage a natural exfoliation and deep cleansing, so you save money on all those other products you used to have to buy all the time. Plus, your skin will clear up and you can say goodbye to all those annoying costly solutions to a problem these products actually prevent. 

The entire line deserves 100 Stars! If you struggle to 
keep your skin clear, these products also provide
a new sense of confidence and are emotionally healing. 

Another surprising use for this product is on scars. Old
scars and new scars. They seem to just fade away. 

As Liv Tyler once said: "I Swear Buy." Well, she was talking about the shampoo. 

I say: "Collect Them." These products are essential and the best I've ever tried.

I have coarse afrcian-american hair that is relaxed straight. This conditioner is the best I have ever used. I wish I could buy it in a larger bottle.  The only thing however, I think it is expensive.  Because of the price I use it only when wanting to deeply condition my hair. Otherwise, I would use it after every shampoo. Wonderful stuff

About two weeks ago I got a very small metal splinter embedded in one of my fingers when I picked up an old office magnifying glass that had a corroded metal trim piece.

I used my conventional tweezers and managed to break off a piece, leaving an even smaller piece that I could hardly see still in my finger.  My conventional tweezers could only push it further into my flesh, so I quit trying to get it out.  

It wasn't doing any harm, surrounded by upper skin layers, so I looked for the best tweezers I could find and ordered these.

I got them a few days ago at work and within a few minutes I had that teeny tiny splinter out of my finger.  These are great

I am obviously addicted to Philosophy, but it's a good addiction.  My skin looks great, better than it ever has in my life!  Whenever I feel like doing something for myself, I try a new Philosophy product, because it's sure to give me a lift.  This product is called a "microdelivery peel", but I view (and use) it more as a toner.  Philosophy's two-part microdelivery peel is awesome, and I would not attempt to replace it with these pads.  With the two part peel, you clean your face with Purity Made Simple cleanser, then massage in the abrasive crystals.  After a few minutes, you squeeze out a little of the liquid, which mixes with the crystals on your face and heats up, infusing your skin with vitamin C and other healthy goodies.  That is a real peel!  These little pads, on the other hand, are cool, refreshing, and subtle.  You can use them every day, and they won't make your skin red.  They freshen your skin, and you know they contain great things that will help your skin, because they are made by Philosophy

After years of searching I've finally found the perfect perfume. Pink Sugar makes me feel fabulous when I wear it; it's so light and `warm' with a base of sensual vanilla. I have the large bottle, body mousse &amp; deodorent at home, and the smaller bottle in my handbag. I don't get bored with this fragrence, like I do with everything else I've tried over the years.

The first time I wore Pink Sugar to work one colleague commented on the aroma of drinking chocolate as I was in the lift with her. The next time I was in the lift, everyone commented on my lovely vanilla perfume. After I applied a freshen up spray, another colleague said she could smell cakes! Yet another colleague demanded to know what I was wearing, and where she could get some. Strangers come up to me in the street to ask what scent I'm wearing...

No this isn't a cheesy ad, it really happened!! 


What do I sense first? Liquorice, a rich aniseed scent that gradually settles into a middle note of caramel. Marshmallow is the first word that springs to mind to me. 

If you like Angel, Fantasy or Princess you need to give this a try!



 *Aquolina needs to make Pink Sugar available to the U.K. - Postage and packing costs a fortune!!!

Go read the review I wrote on the shampoo the same goes for this product. Cheaper at QVC then Amazon like all the other 30 or so products I have shopped around for in the last 6 months. Go back into the stores people you will find prices cheaper than at Amazon!!!

I purchased this after reading the reviews. I had never heard of it, let alone tested it. I had some gift certificates &amp; thought I'll be impulsive. ~ When I first opened it I thought "oh no, this is going to be heady (or strong)".. but it seemed to 'change within seconds upon application, and got even better as it settled. My daughter wears vera wang princess, and she, too, loves Lolita. It's my newest fav &amp; a possible signature scent for me. Will def. buy again

I have been looking for this eyeliner for years!  Ever since they stopped carrying it at Rite-Aid I have been on a quest to find the perfect waterproof eyeliner to replace the 2.99 lord and berry one.  I even tried expensive brands like mac and clinique with no such luck.  This eyeliner is great for women who like to line their inner eye, it goes on smooth and dark and stays put until you wash it off

The resort we stayed at in Fiji (Maravu, on the island of Taveuni - also highly recommended) used Pure Fiji products in their bures, and I fell in love with this pineapple soap.  We showered outdoors and the smell and feel will always remind me of our honeymoon.  I brought some of this soap back in my luggage but it was lost somehow, so I just had to buy some!  We did get some of the shampoo and conditioner samples which also smell wonderful!  Mmmm..

This is a great cleaner, but I'd suggest getting the Anthony Algae cleanser first.  This glycolic facial cleaner does prep your face for a good shave, but overdries.  It is not suggested for those who have dry skin or acne problems

This stuff smells just like philosophy's handmade hand cream but not as strong, that's why I took one point off. It has a light, sweet lemon scent with a vanilla background. Of course it's is wonderful as a shampoo and body gell just like all the other philosophy 3-1's. If it where stronger scented it would be my favorite

I use this purely as shower gel/cleanser and absolutely love it.  The smell is great - not too overpowering and really perks me up in the morning.  It reminds me of the lemonade stands I used to have as a kid.  Easily one of my favorite Philosophy fragrances.  I also recommend "Falling in Love," and "Strawberry Daquiri."  In fact, I don't think you could go wrong with any Philosophy products!

I received a free sample during "Clinique days" at my local department store.  I wore it the next day to work and received several compliments on how "clean" and "light" it smelled.  Two coworkers even went out within the next week and purchased some for themselves.  It is perfect for a light, clean scent during the day... to wear to work, or a day out with friends or that special someone.  It smells wonderful, but not as though you are trying too hard.  Perfect

The citrus touch in this perfume keeps it from being flowery, and potentially old ladyish.  It is not too strong even at first application, but wears quite well.  You will not feel as though you are wearing perfume; it seems far too light for that.  I would certainly recommend it for its versatility, as well

I love this perfume because it really lifts my mood.  I always thought of it as a little more citrus-y, but it's just a very fun perfume.  It's also nice because it's fun and flirty but still mature in a young professional type of way--if that makes any sense.  Ultimately, it's a great perfume, and I wear it almost daily

     This product is wonderful for individuals with very dry skin. I usually apply this cream right before I put my foundation on and it works very well together.  It leaves my skin feeling very moist without it being sticky.  In addition to that, it's got a luscious cucumber smell to it.  I would highly reccomend this product to those who are seeking to get rid their "Moisture Thirsting" skin.  *Although it may be alittle costly, it will last you about 4 months~

I have used these for years, and when I run out, my skin knows and shows the difference.  I have super sensitive skin that tends to become red and itchy when exposed to any kind of change in weather....cold or hot.  I carry these in my purse, and have them stashed all over the house....misting my face many times a day....voila....clear and moisterized skin!  They really do work wonders on sensitive facial skin, and they keep mine from being red and itchy, which makes me very happy

I don't have excessively oily skin, but I've never been able to wear mascara without smudging.  Waterproof, smudgeproof, expensive, drugstore, you name it I've tried it.  Every single one left dark shadows under my eyes within 2 or 3 hours.  I'd given up on mascara completely, but thought I'd try one more time with this (with the money back guarantee from spalook, what's the risk?)

This mascara lives up to it's name as smudge-proof.  Even wearing sunscreen on my under-eye area, it doesn't transfer.  Even in 100+ deg Phoenix heat, it stays.  I *love* it for this reason.  It also comes off easily at night; no problems there.

However, I'm giving it only 4 stars because it does flake a little throughout the day.  Not a lot, and not enough to make me stop using it (the first truly smudge-proof mascara I've found), but it is there.  Since it's advertised as smudge and flake-proof, I can't give it the full 5 stars

Ever wished you could rub your eyes while you're wearing your make up?  Now you can.  You can't be rubbing at your eyes too much or it will start to flake off, but this mascara takes quite a beating before it will budge and will never, ever smudge.  One might be led to believe this means it is difficult to remove at night, but all you need to remove it is water.  This stuff is practically worth getting just to ponder the chemistry involved

This mascara is great, it's easy to remove with a little warm water, but the best thing about it is that it won't give you 'racoon eyes'. There's no dis-coloration of the skin around the eyes. It also keeps looking great all through the day, no need to re-apply it.
The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is, that even though they come in different colors, they all look more black than colored when dry. So the color doesn't stand out enough.
Still, I can highly recommend it

Philosophy products are very eye catching.  Their smart, clean looking bottles and the cool names given to each.  I work with skin care products and don't always believe what they claim.  There are usually far too many claims to be made that simply can't be done to someones skin.  
This product however, is pretty good.  It's a fairly good moisturiser that could honestly sell for less considering the cost of the product, but it does do the job it promises.  The only problem I have with it, is that for someone with sensitive skin, there is far too much frangrant extracts in here.  It cannot be good for sensitive skin.  I'd recommend this to Dry skin people only

I have suffered from rosacia for the past nine years. As I was fairly young to be starting through a change of life, I had no idea what was causing my complexion problems. Not understanding (or expecting)what was happening to my skin, I made many many mistakes during the first year or so, trying to remedy the symptoms with countless products formulated more for adult acne or aging tired skin, bad idea. If you have rosacea or very sensitive skin, you know that sometimes it seems that all you need do is touch your skin the wrong way and you break out, let alone slathering some chemically based, perfumed, or exfoliating (ground pits and the like) product on your face. This becomes especially discouraging when you are also beginning to see the normal signs of aging but sensitivities won't allow you to take advantage of some of the great treatments out there to nourish your skin and stay a step ahead of the wrinkles, not to mention feeling starved for the moisture which is the real key to younger, healthy looking skin. After awhile I was afraid to try anything else, so I just stopped. I washed my face gently and left it at that. Well it only got worse and I felt like a dried up prune. Enter Philosophy hope in a jar for dry sensitive skin. It's as if this product was made just for me. Now instead of people asking me "what's wrong with your face?" they ask, "what type of skincare do you use?" Since I've been using The Philosophy skin care line, I find I guite often feel comfortable going out without makeup, something I had rarely done since my twenties. Since sun protection is so important, Philosophy offers a product called, When hope is not enough with spf 20 for daytime which comes in a bottle, but I have found that my skin responds much better to the Hope in a jar-dry sensitive formula, then followed by Philosophy's seperate sunsreen called Shelter-spf 15. This is because "Shelter" does not contain vitamin C or peptides and has a slightly lower concentration of sunscreens, contrary to the spf-20 moisurizer combo. You may be able to get by with the combination product and save a few bucks, but the aforementioned ingredients in it do not agree with my sensitivities, especially the vitamin C. As for the much needed exfoliation dilemma, try philosophy's, Micro-delivery peel pads or their "Peel kit" both are soothing and non-abrasive. Hope this helps and enjoy your new skin!

I LOVE everything about these sops!!!  They are luxurious and delicious at the same time......one thing I need to indulge in.
The scents last for days after you've used them.....my bathroom still smells like a mix of verbena and honey-almond!!!! Just scrumptious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not to mention how your skin smells and feels afterwards!
These are amazing soaps that EVERYONE should use.  I feel exquisite using them and the gift sets are a fabulous thing to give to friends or even aquaintences.  They are sure to think of how thoughtful you were to give it to them everytime they use this wonderful soap!!!!!!

With just a hint of sheer red color, this lip balm in a tube is one of the best I've tried. The smell is intoxicating, the feel divine. What's best to me: 1) the subtle shade of red color, sheer but sexy, moisturizing but not greasy or gloppy and 2) it lasts FOREVER. I have never before paid $10 for a tube of lip balm, but I will gladly do it again. For those that wonder who it looks good on: my opinion is everybody! I am a dark-brown haired, light skinned, brown-eyed girl, with no pink or rosy color to my natural dead-white skin color/coloring. I burn easily and freckle, too. My sister has brownish-auburn-hair, medium-toned beige skin color with hazel-brown eyes and it looks great on her, too. She tans easily. My niece is blondish-brown haired, has light brown eyes and fair skin with a bit of pink in it and tans easily. It looked great on her, too. 

Buy it and enjoy it

This is one of my favorite perfumes.  I love anything vanilla and this has a great combination of it with violets, musk and iris.  It is a strong smell, so go easy on it. One spray lasts all day.

This has been my everyday scent for the last six years. The predominent note is a sparkling anise, an anise that affects a cold, even metallic, chemic artifice. Swirling about this shivery base note are hints of moss, violet, and vanilla-like tonka, lending an aura of both forest and fantasy. 

Though this is a relatively popular scent, Lolita eschews convention. There are no white flowers, no rose, no peach, none of the banal and cloying sweetness that plagues so many scents. This perfume is instead sensual yet apart, not at all come-hither but insinuating and dark as a Grimm's tale. The tonka is sweet and powdery, gently seductive, while the more prominent anise intoxicates.

The bottle is stunning; I never throw out a spent one.

Orris Root powder has a scent similar to violets although in this Tisty Tosty bath bomb, even with the addition of rose oil, it is not an overpowering fragrance. I think they could add double the rose oil, but you can add in rose and ylang ylang if you are in the mood. The Tisty Tosty heart-shaped bath bomb is perfect if you enjoy blending your own essential oils or prefer a mild/calming bathing experience. 

I'd suggest using this one for skin calming and also adding in a "Romance In a Stone," "Sex Bomb" or "Chelsea Garden" bath bomb to add a little more romance to the bath. 

I did feel emotionally calm (rose balances the emotions) and my skin loved this bath bomb, but it was not as sensory as I'd hoped. Following this bath with the "It's A Pleasure Treasure Massage Bar" is fun, also heart-shaped. 

You may want to try the "Violet" soap with this bathing experience. The next time I try this, I might mix it with an "Elixir" bath melt and a bit of the "Bathos" bubble bar, also scented with violet. 

As far as this being a magic spell, you just never know who might call you when you use this bath. Probably right when you are in the bath. So, if you think this will work instantly, you might want to keep the phone by the tub. It was funny, but when I was in the bath, my husband was trying to call me and said he let the phone ring and ring. Did he really think I would leave the pleasure of a Lush bath to answer the phone? 

Personally, I think they should scent this bath bomb like the It's a Pleasure Treasure Massage Bar. It is blissfully delicious and almost seems edible - looks like white chocolate (it is mostly cocoa butter) and has a heady scent of orange blossom honey and neroli.

This smells good and the heart shape is cute. But, it lost it's scent when it dissolved which was dissipointing and the flowers turned the water darkish. I liked it but it's not one of my favorites.

If you love roses, this is a romantic bath luxury, with seven rose buds for your bathing delight. For a candlelit bath with romance, let it dissolve unencumbered. For scent but no mess, put it in a mesh bag first, because little flower bits will be all over the tub. At least it has no glitter. The scent is not particularly strong, but it is full of a natural rose scent that smells wonderful

I have been using Lush products for a few years now. First introduced to them when I was in Australia.
I always keep some in my linen closet as it gives a faint wonderful scent to all the sheets and pillowcases.

Try all of the bath bombs. I use the Tisty Tosty whenever I need an evening of self indulgence. Put the water on and watch the heart-shaped bomb fizzle and send hundreds of rose petals floating to the top of the tub.
Put some fluffy bath towels to warm on a rail.
Place some Dr Haushka's oil to heat by a radiator.
Pour a glass of champagne.
Surround the tub with lots of  tea lights.
Put on some Rahman music.
Get in and imagine a private Ganges.
When you get out its very eassy to scoop up the petals- take the pre-warmed towels and wrap yourself in one.

 By then the oils will be warm and pour in palm of hand and rub on body. 
I also like to put some  bath bombs in guest bedrooms with the towels- 
If you haven't tried the Karma soap do try it ......alone or with someone special..

This is the one you give to someone you love. The wonderful rose scent is very light, not overpowering at all. And the pretty little dried rosebuds are so charming. I love lying in the tub with those rosebuds floating around me. It makes me feel like I'm lying in a beautiful garden

I had read about these new creme eyeshadows in one of the magazines within the last few months. I decided to go to the counter at the Bloomingdale's near my house. The SA at the counter said she thought based on my coloring and eyes that the rose gold would be a good choice for me. I was looking for a shadow that could be good for daytime and also nighttime. I took home the rose gold and it was really really beautiful on. Not only that, but it is long-lasting and doesn't crease. I may have to invest in one or more of the other colors available. Definitely a worthwhile purchase and the tube will last you a long time.

I am 5'11" tall, and have stretchmarks everywhere from growing 8 inches in one year as an adolescent.  So I thought I'd get even more of them during my pregnancy and 40 lb. weight gain.  I bought the Mustela lotion as a "might as well" gift to myself, not really expecting anything.  I am thrilled to say that after using this cream every day on my breasts and belly during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy, I didn't get ANY new stretchmarks anywhere.  I still can't believe it -- and I was looking closely for them just to be sure.  The lotion is quite rich, so a little goes a long way -- the tube lasted 8 weeks.  I'm completely sold on Mustela products, and use the super soft and fragrant baby wipes on my new little girl.  No diaper rash at all so far

I started using this cream during my 2nd month of pregnancy.  I think it's important to start building the elasticity of your skin early on, which could be the reason I had success with it.  While the cream is kindof expensive-- when you think about avoiding stretchmarks, no price is too high. I used about 4 tubes for the duration.  I expected to get stretchmarks because my mom had them with me, so I was happy to get anything less than hers.  Anyway, I didn't get any at all on my stomach until the last two weeks (my baby was 8lbs. 8oz.) and they are really small.  I put the cream on my breasts and abdomen every day after a shower, but because it was expensive I skipped my sides (love handle area) and did get stretchmarks there which were darker than the ones on my stomach. Since my stomach has gone down, the ones on my stomach are very light and will probably go away enough to satisfy my ego.  I highly recommend giving the Mustela cream a chance

I first tried this when my Mum bought a bottle during her holiday in November. The weather was cold, wet &amp; dark at home. When I sprayed some on my wrists I wasn't impressed.

Come June &amp; sunny, hot &amp; bright days, I found myself trying `Just Me' in the shops &amp; buying a bottle (which I'm quickly making my way through).

Lighter &amp; easier to wear then `Paris Hilton', I'm using it all the time. Scent wise; the strongest note for me is the pink peppercorn - sharp &amp; tangy. It contrasts nicely with the floral notes, so neither individual note overpowers me.

Overall `Just Me' can be worn anywhere during the day; work, shopping or lunch.
For evening and autumn/winter look elsewhere.

I'm 18! Well you will think what does 18 have to do with this cream.

I don't have any wrinkle. My skin has been really good until I get into college. My eyes become really tired and I start to have a lot of dark circle plus puffiness.

After reading a recommendation from a fashion magazine, which says everybody at every age need an eye cream. Ok, fine, I will get one. I chose the one got the highest rate!

Overall quality, it is very good to moisturize my eye area. This means it is easier to apply foundation/concealer/eye makeup. But my puff is still here. I still have dark circle! No reducing! I know that I need to have a better schedule to have enough sleep but still, I expected higher on this product.

About the size, the small little teeny tiny one is good enough for you to use for months. Usually I will use it at night. When I have to apply concealer, I will apply another time.

I received a tube of philosophy's cinnamon buns flavored lip gloss for Christmas (along with other philosophy products). I was super excited to try this because I've been told by numerous people that philosophy's products are spectacular. First, I must point out that there are sparkles in this lip gloss. Although they're very subtle on your lips, if you're the type of gal who hates sparkles and shimmer in your makeup, I'd stay away from this product. As for smell, it DOES smell like cinnamon buns. It certainly does not TASTE like it however (which is a good thing... I tend to lick off my lip gloss if it tastes good... this lip gloss does not taste good). It's very sticky and thick so you don't have to use too much. It also stays on your lips for a good amount of time. Would I suggest this product? If you're looking for a good-smelling, long lasting lip gloss, I'd definitely recommend this. However, if these two things don't matter to you I'd suggest you skip this ($10 for a tube of lip gloss isn't cheap after all) and go for a drugstore brand lip gloss

I was pretty wary of buying this because of the price, but it really is worth it. The can has lasted me almost a year, and it's not even empty! It's wonderful! I have very oily, acne prone skin with rosacea, and this stuff makes me look like I have a flawless, beautiful complexion. And I'm not exaggerating. It feels like I'm not wearing makeup. I just can't say enough about it. This is the one thing that I couldn't live without. You need to try it!!!

I have been looking high and low for a fragrance that wasn't strong.  I have tried so many perfumes and body sprays it is ridiculous.  I have finally found the one I will use for more than a week.  I love it!  

The smell is so clean and simple.  The first day I wore it I had 3 seperate people tell me I smelled good.  I have NEVER had even one person tell me that, let alone 3.  I was amazed.  Also, I noticed that they told me I smelled good.  They didn't say your perfume smells good.  

I am not sure how to describe the smell.  It reminds me of that out-of-the-shower fresh smell that we wish we could have all day.  I will never use any other fragrances but Philosophy fragrances.  I plan on trying all their other wonderful scents as well

I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate by the end of the as other products have.  Also my coloring is very fair, red hair and blue eyes, even with brown/black mascara I always looked a little off-matched.  The brown in this line is a beautiful color and looks more natural than any I have ever used.  The ease of removal is the icing on the cake

Most waterproof mascaras are designed to come off with an oil-based remover.  Stupid idea;   our skin has oil in it.  After a couple hours we end up with "racoon" eyes."  DOH, who needs that?  Mirenesse mascara only comes off with soap AND water, in combination.  Better living through chemistry!  Since I happen to be one of those people with a little extra oil in their skin in adulthood, I especially appreciate this fact, plus they make it in Brown/black  I'm a redhead, and am so sick of   searching for something other than black-black mascara!  It is simply too dark if you are not a brunette or blonde.  I need something with some brown in it, and this mascara fits the bill, perfectly.  For those who find it too clumpy, well, learn how to apply mascara--tweens!  This mascara goes on best with one coat, so make your first application count.  You don't need a second coat.  It won't look good, so do one coat, period.  If you can't get it right the first time, you need some practice and a mirror with a higher magnification.  If you think you need more mascara than that, think again.  Unless you are walking Sunset

I really loved the clean, citrus scent of Tommy Girl. It has a grapefruit-like scent--very clean and pungent.

Unfortunately, after I became pregnant and had my son, my body chemistry changed. Now, it stinks on me. :o(

Still, it smells great as a scent, but you may want to try a tester before buying it. This is one of those fragrances that I think are a bit risky to buy "sight unseen"...unless you're sure your gal absolutely loves clean, citrusy, pungent scents. (But remember, that doesn't mean it will smell good on her...

The first thing you notice is the clean burst of citrus. It's yummy and fresh and sexy. Then the fragrance reveals its deeper layers and you are drawn in. This is a wonderful fragrance for men. Both of Vera Wang's fragrances (for men and women) are top quality, multi layered, emminently pleasing, and would make fabulous gifts. Buy this for your man and enjoy

This is truly the best in highlighting products and I have tried many high end and cheaper products out there.  This is so light and just doesn't get all cakey and greasy.  I have tried so many brands that claim to look natural, but they just don't.  This really does and don't let the price fool you either.  It only takes alittle and lasts a long time, so well worth the price for the look it gives.  I love this!

I'm giving this product 4 stars for how well this pencil blends with any brow color....I would think for people who use and like to define brows with pencil, this is a perfect neutral color.I subtracted one star because i
prefer to apply brow definers with brow powder and a brush. I think it looks more natural..  Brenda Christian makes a brow powder which I prefer over pencils but the color of this pencil is far superior to any powder
I can find.  Sometimes I mix the two. I start with the pencil and add a bit of powder.  All all, it's the color of this pencil that is superior to all other eyebrow pencils

I like that the gloss isn't goopy or sticky, and that it provides a sheer wash of color that seems to stay put for a while, but you don't get much product. I bought Flare and love the color and the way it somewhat stains your lips with a light wash of color, so even when the gloss wears off you still have some color on your lips. I wasn't really thrilled with the small amount of gloss you actually get in the pen. But overall, I do like it, but don't know if I'd buy it again

Bought this for my boyfriend, and I can't stop smelling him because it's unlike any other cologne I've ever come upon.  It's so intriguing that I find myself sniffing him just to get another whiff of it.  I can best describe it as a soft-suede with hints of amber, vanilla, and wood. It smells better after it's been on the skin for a while.  It does  have a slight feminine scent, however, this makes me like it more, and makes me want HIM to wear it more.  It's definetely for a confident man

Eternity was signature scent of the late 80's early 90's and has been around long enough to gain a rightful, classic status now.
It is one of the best on the market, it smells classy, clean, zingy and has more than a touch of the erotic about it.
Always worth having a bottle handy even if you don't wear it everyday, it is a yummy, scrummy scent

I absolutely love this eyeshadow. I have it in three different colors, as after my first one (the Illuminateur), I got addicted. I've since bought the Ambre and the Bleu Swimming Pool. It can be hard to tell from pictures on this site, or any other, what the color of this item is really like. That is it say, it changes depending on the light. My white Illuminateur looks purple in some lights, shiny white in others, and a light blue in others. It's really amazing on its own, or layered. All of the colors have a lot of "oomph" to them. Make sure you shake the bottle before using for best color results (as mentioned on the packaging).

As someone who doesn't own a lot of makeup brushes, I love that it includes one. However, I have noticed with these, and with other brands of eyeshadow that have similar packaging, if you're not careful, you can bend some of the bristles backwards (and they may stay that way) when reinserting the brush. Simply solved by not rushing. :

	Glamorous, mysterious, seductive all describe Armani Code, a captivating orange blossom based scent from Giorgio Armani Fragrance.

	As one would expect from this master couturier the bottle itself is a gem.  Tapering from a weighted base the slim flacon seems to glow as lacquered shades of blue sweep from an early dawn at the bottom of the sleek holder to midnight nearing the top.  Adding to the fragrance's intrigue is an oriental effect achieved by  lace embroidery on the glass.

	The scent  is sweet yet sensuous with a sparkle provided by orange zest.  With orange blossom at its heart Armani Code is enhanced by Sambac jasmine, Madagascan vanilla and honey.  The man in my life called it "delicious," and I do, too.  It's now high on my list of favorite fragrances.

I don't know how many mascaras I own but there's always about two or three that I hold as my favorite or just for different occasions. One of those is Hypnose and I really like it for when I go out or just looking for that dramatic look.

Postive:
1.) The look: I've never neccessarily wanted to wear fake eyelashes but they do look almost perfect. Unbelievably, Hypnose gives you that look. It's amazing just how feathery your eyelashes look.
2.) Flaking: This mascara never really flaked on the bottom of my eyes. That's really important to me.

Negative:
1.) This mascara starts out great but after about two and a half weeks it starts emptying out on you. This might just be because there were days when I reapplyed it or simply because I just used it pretty well (1 coat just about everyday because of how much I liked it).

Summary: If you want that natural yet "are those real lashes?!" look, then you'll like this mascara. I'm giving it four stars instead of five simply because of how long it lasts but if you use it once it a while, then it will last you a while

I was very impressed with the texture of these shadows. They slip on softly with a great feel and last all day or night with no creasing. I also like the way the colors will go on subtley with a light touch or with a heavier hand build up for more intensity. The color selection is gorgeous. Just one word of warning -- you can't really go by the color samples. It's better to see them in person. I bought Lilac Mist which is beautiful on the brow bone and was very close to what I was expecting. But Paris By Night looks like a gray but is actually a deep mauve. I was dissapointed until I tried it. It contoured my eyes beautifully and while intense is very natural looking. This is about the fourth time I've bought Laura Mercier products and I've been totally pleased with the quality.

Like the powder blush, this eye shadow is silky not chalky.  It goes on sheer and looks natural but beautiful.  All of the colors I've tried are very nice.  Toasted Almond is a wonderful ivory.  American Coffee is a rich brown (but doesn't go on too dark -- you can layer it for more drama), Caramel is a creamy beige.  
This is a great product for everyday.
NOTE:  You will need an eye shadow brush for this just as you need a blush brush -- it does not come with one

I have used this product for the past 16 years. It is wonderful!The Super Double Face Powder is actually a foundation and matte powder all rolled into one product. The product comes with an application sponge, goes on dry, gives superb coverage! I don't even use my Clinique concelar when I wear this product, it is that good! This product works best with those individuals who have normal or combination skin.

As someone who really dislikes making up, but needs a bit of cover in her face powder, I have found Clinique's Superpowder to be just the right product. I have been using it for nearly ten years. In between Superpowder purchases I have tried other lesser brands and have always returned to this product. It is truly no muss, no fuss. No foundation, or concealers, just a nice simple matte powder that sets in naturally. No powdery bits sitting on the skin surface, no flaking ... and stays on all day with nary a touch up ... just perfect

This is a fantastic product and lasts forever, so the relatively steep cost is not so bad.  This is a great product for using under eye makeup, because it makes the eye makeup slip on better and stay on longer, or alone, for a natural but still 'put-together' look.  I love this product more than mascara, and haven't found anything like it in other product lines.

I have never found a compact foundation, cream or powder, that looked and lasted even remotely as well as a liquid foundation with a dusting of powder over it. Until now. This is an amazing makeup, and the best part is that it doesn't take a whole lot of product to achieve perfect coverage. My skin tends to be red, but this doesn't even hint at it. Plus, it's a nice matte without being too dry. 
For everyday, this is my time saving, face perfecting miracle.

For a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is MAC. Lipglass feels good on your lips, as if it contained some emollients. And (this is a big AND) it's not tacky or sticky. 

The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. 

Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. 

Enjoy!

MAC LipGlass is the absolute best. There are plenty of colors to choose from, SUPER-Shiny, and the gloss is thick, stays on and doesn't run. 
The best colors are....
NICO for a cute lavender pink color with a glittery shine. 
OYSTERGIRL is a shimmery baby pink.
OH BABY is the perfect gloss for any earth toned lipstick.
CHAI looks amazing with black smokey eyes. It's the perfect neutral earthy gloss and has no glitter or shimmer - just pure shine

I'm REALLY anal about scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored with vanilla, but MAC LipGlass isn't that vanilla-ish at all!  It's got very pigmented color, it stays on a LONG time for a gloss, and each tube lasts a long time...  Don't let what the other reviewer said about the vanilla scent throw you off

I received this as a gift, and love it.  I don't normally use dusting powders, but this is light and silky.  The scent is very patchouli, which I happen to like.  Sort of reminds me of the head shops from the 60's-70's.  

I especially like the fact that all LUSH products are natural without a lot of chemicals

This tool is great for removing whiteheads and blackheads both.  As a RN with dermatology experience I have used many tools, I like this one as it saves you from bruising, or squishing your skin. So it solves the problem with a minimum of damage.  If you haven't used anything like this it may take some getting used to, but it's way better than using your fingers.  I gave it 4 of 5 stars as it can be a bit difficult to line up because the hole is so small

I love this scent - it's so fresh yet so distinctive.  Light enough to wear to a ballet or other event where you're in close qurters with others, but distinct enough that people notice it.  Every time I wear it I get compliments on how great I smell.

I really smell the peach in this, and thats why I love it. I love how its mixed in with the powdery florals. Its not heavy, its sexy without trying too hard and there is something old fashioned about it but it has a modern twist. I love this perfume

I am so sick of all the fragrances out there that smell like chocolate, pie or cake. Why people want to smell like food puzzles me. That's why I was so glad to find a feminine floral scent with a little tease to it. Maybe Baby is delightful, not too heavy but making its presence known. The complements will flow. It's sweet (not too sweet though) and innocent while at the same time being flirty. If I had to pick a season it reminds me of it would be Spring. I can't describe a frangrance anymore than I can describe a wine but with all the stinkers out there I just had to put in a good word for this very wearable scent.

If you love the scent of the Bathina line, Benefit has finally come out with an eau de toilette with the same scent. I wear this scent everyday and I always get compliments. I love to put the scent in my hair because it lingers in hair longer than skin. Many scents smell different on different skin types, but Maybe Baby is a pretty true scent. I guaruntee you will absolutely love this perfume and so will everyone around you. :

Ok I have really large lips and for years I have tried everything to protect them. Get this tin, for some reason the stick doesn't work as well, and your lips will be unchapped for the whole day. It's pricey but worth every penny if your like me and your lips chap easily. Trust me I have tried everything, even pricier chapsticks and this one does the trick

L'Occitane combined their famous lavender note with touches of peach, marigold and freesia to create a lovely, fresh and relaxing scent.  It's a nice one to wear before bed, too, not overpowering.  In the summer, I look for fragrances that contain natural notes mosquitoes do not care for and lavender is one of them.  The peach note in some fragrances also turns funky on my skin, but I have not had this problem with Eau de Recolte Bleue.  I prefer this over their Lavender Harvest fragrance, which I think would smell better on men (JMOP.)

Here is a description from their website:

"Eau de la RÃ©colte Bleue exudes all the pleasures of Provence. Both fresh and as light as air, it captures the celebratory feel of the Lavender Harvest.

Composed from a blend of the green scent of leaves and A.O.C. Lavender essential oil, Eau de la RÃ©colte Bleue is accompanied by the delicate notes of freesia, marigold and frosted peach. Woody and musky aromas then leave a lingering and sensual, fragrant trail."

All in all, I find this soft, gentle and thoroughly wearable.  Especially enjoy it on a summer evening.

Growing up worshiping the sun had finally taken its toll on my skin. As of late I have noticed sun spots on my face, chest and hands (yuck!). My Esthetician recommended I try Murad's Age Spot and Pigment Lightening Gel. In about a month I noticed the spots beginning to fade! It is super light weight and soaks in fast too!  Now all I have to do is remember the sunscreen..

Simplify, simplify, simplify! That's what I try to do with my beauty routine. Hence, I was first attracted to LAURA MERCIER'S facial cleanser by its name "ONE-STEP CLEANSER." 

I'm staying with it because it works. No more separate purchases for eyemake removers or "deep cleansers. 

"ONE-STEP CLEANSER" removes all traces of makeup even from the delicate eye area and leaves my skin feeling clean, supple and nourished. It's both easy and effective

I decided to try it out and have found the only soap I want to use.  The fragrance is great, it does not overpower.  I guess the milling process gives the soap it's texture which removes the need for all those bath/shower accessories.  And 1 bar lasted over 2 months.  I will definitely be ordering more and trying other products this vendor carries

The ground almond hulls are gentle enough for daily use of the soap directly on the skin without being scratchy. The scent is strong, but not overpowering and both the soap and scent are long lasting. This soap is also so moisturizing that my  skin doesn't require lotion as it does after most store brand soaps and shower gels. This particular soap is my main shower bar and my great experience with it convinced me to return to bar soap after years of being a Bath and Body Works shower gel and lotion fiend.

"Body so fine" is the most beautiful and luxurious cosmetic I ever had. I recommend it because the description of benefit is absolutely real. It's the most delicious, velvet and beautiful balm for the legs and the arms. Also the retro - chic and vintage box and can are romantic and beautiful. PERFECT for me

I got some of this body balm yesterday. The lady at the Benefit counter said that it would make my skin look luminescent like a Victoria's Secret model. She put a sample on one of my arms and I held it up to the other arm. The difference was amazing! The arm with the Bathina looked smoother, silker, and had a pearlized look. I can't stop raving about this stuff. It is slightly expensive, but the tin is really big (and adorable) and the supply of the balm is huge. It should last a really long time. This balm is one of the best products that Benefit has

Benefit claims that this is all you will want to wear, and I am starting to think this might be true...

First, I have to say that the texture is intriguing.  It's a balm, but it feels much more velvety, and the slight shimmer gives you a sheen.

Second, I am a sucker for the packaging and presentation.  It comes in a little tin box, with the signature Bathina (very retro chic) and a black powder puff that has a pink ribbon holder.  It makes you want to apply the product in public, just to have an excuse to show off the set.  Also, it ups the feminity factor of applying a product with the little puff (very "I adore being a girl...")

Then, there's the scent.  It's a floral, sexy fragrance that doesn't overpower.  It's clean and a big plus is that it doesn't make me sneeze, like some other scents.

I think that a little goes a long way, and thus, I can say that even though it's a "boutique-brand" product, it is very affordable.  I think that as warmer weather sets in, and you want to show off a little more skin, this is a product that would enhance a tan.

I couldn't resist the very feminine and retro look of the packaging. And it does look cute in the bathroom. That being said this is great to add a layer of sheen to the legs. Your calves look great without stockings. I find it too waxy to use on the rest of the body but there's nothing better on bare legs. To add a glow to the skin, especially to a tan, try Benefit's Flamingo Fancy

Clinique's Bare Brilliance is one of my absolute favorite lipsticks ever!
It has a fairly sheer finish with lovely little sparkles in it.  I have Berrylicious(sheer grape) and Cherry Quartz(sheer, true red--doesn't look like it does on the color swatch) and neither overwhelms my pale skin.  I wouldn't be caught dead without a Bare Brilliance lipstick in my makeup bag or purse!

     Here's a gem of an idea for a small gift or stocking stuffer for the preteen girls on your list - a cute lip gloss ring from Hard Candy.

     The ring is heart shaped with a flip top filled with a lightly tinted sparkly lip gloss.  It comes in three shades and glosses - Heartbreaker, which is a peach; Kiss Me, which is hot pink, and Yummy, which is baby blue.  All are fruit scented.

      Boxed in a ring box with a faceted lid (presentation, you know), it's finger fun

After watching Anastasia do eye brows on TV i decided that i needed to get this item and try to do better shaping of my eye brows.  After receiving this kit, i found that is is quite hard to do by yourself.  Holding the stencil in the proper alinement is difficult for one person to do on themselves.  I do however shape my daughters brows.  In conclusion i think that it takes a lot of skill and i think it would be better to go to her personally or some other experienced person.

One time while in Los Angeles, I had the forward thinking enough to book an appointment with Anastasia because I'd seen her on Oprah and in magazines and knew she was Queen of the eyebrows.  I thought if I had one appointment, I could maintain them afterward myself.  If you live nowhere near Bev Hills or aren't going to be in LA, this is the next best thing.  It's like having her in your home permanently.
The kit is fantastic.  There are different colours to choose from and it's easy to use.  It does look a little weird at first if you use the colour where there are no brows, but I don't know if everyone can tell, or we girls are just a little more fussy when it comes to ourselves.
This is the best way to get the perfect shape and it really DOES make a difference to your face.  You'll look better and ultimately feel better.  The stencil is the best invention and I highly recommend it

This powder is great. It has great coverage without looking cakey. I also have sensitive skin and this has never bothered me. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's still a little dark for very light skin and it needs to be "touched-up" a little more often than other powders I've tried, but it's worth it

If you have smooth skin, this product is not for you. 

My skin had no human quality about it; after I went through many procedures of bleaching and laser treatments. I suffer from extreme skin dryness, uneven and dull skin. Other lotions made my face look greasy, or failed to give it that moisturised look.

I have tried many products, for my extreme dry dull skin issues, and this is the first product that has worked for me. Now my skin looks hydrated and normal. It is quite a feat

I was recommended this product for my son's hair and have had many recommendations over the years, since he has beautiful thick curly hair that can tend to be dry and frizzy.  I used a little of this product in his wet hair and it leaves it shiny with less frizz and more curls.  He is 10 and not crazy about the smell, but I think it smells nice.  Fantastic product

I purchased this product based on the reviews, and I can't begin to tell you how glad I am to have the Hair Honey.  It is wonderful!!  It leaves my hair looking absolutely healthy and bouncy.  The smell was overwhelming at first but the benefits of what the product does for your hair are far greater.

I will be using this for a long time to come

I just started using Carols Daughters products but I really like the Hair Honey as an everyday moisturizer for my ends and to smooth my natural hair in the front. I just use a little water and hair honey, tie a scarf for about ten minutes, and my all-natural new growth is smooth, soft, and exactly where I want it to be without using harsh gels, sprays, or spritzes. I am using this and the CD Healthy Hair Butter as a leave-in. I love the fact that its all natural ingredients that are really great and yummy for the hair.

Forgive me for the rhyme, but the sentiment is true.  This product is rich, but at the same time light.  After opening the jar, I loved the way the Hair Honey smelled, it has a sweet aroma but I didn't detect the "cirtus" smell in the product description.  I am only sorry I didn't get the larger size.

I originally bought this item because I was hoping for the same scent that Yankee candle produces in their candle line.  The smell is nice, although it doesn't reach out and grab you like true buttercream.  Still, it's nice to shower with and you won't be disappointed with the lather.  I put a quarter sized amount on my shower puff and still had to ring out foam from it after I was finished.  Also, the lather is creamy and it just feels like it is moisturizing your skin.  All in all, I am happy with my purchase.  I only gave 4 stars because I like a stronger scent, but if you like more subtlety I'm sure you'll enjoy it

This concealer comes in a pencil form, so it is very precise and offers very good coverage.  It stays on well.  It is more waxy and not as soft and creamy as most concealers, so you can put it in a small, precise spot and it will actually stay there.  I have tried many concealers for small blemishes, and this is my favorite.  It comes in enough shades so you can find a good match, which is important

 wear make up every day, and I usually wear foundation, eyeliner, mascara, eyeshadow and lip gloss. That's my every day make up. By the end of the day I have to get it off in order to sleep well. Lancome make up remover helps me a lot. Its very easy to use,it takes off make up quickly and without scrubbing. It's gentle and not irritating. It also smells nice. Though it's kind of expensive, it's a good product.

The emotionally healing benefits of orange oil and lavender become immediately apparent when you apply this to your scalp. If you can find someone to give you a head massage with this product, then you can truly relax. If applying this yourself, it works well as an at home hair treatment to nourish the hair follicles and promote healthy hair growth. You will also notice your hair becoming stronger and retaining a much deeper shine. The essential oils in this product help to activate micro-circulation which may cause a slight tingling and warming of the scalp. Leave this in for about 5-10 minutes and then wash your hair as normal. You may find you need less conditioner when using this product. Many hairdressers will use this product when giving a conditioning head massage and that is where I first found out about this product. I bought my first bottle the day I had the massage. I was that impressed and I keep buying this product.

I use this everyother day before shampooing. My hair is much less greasy after using it!! I've also noticed that my hair seems to have more body at the roots. It also has a very pleasant orange/citrus scent. This product is worth every cent. I definitely recommend it for those with oily scalps and thinning hair

For those bored with the same old bottles of shampoo an hair products at their local drugstore this is a fun new way of washing their hair with no chemicals and natural botanicals that truly do wonders and enhance every single hair.

This solid shampoo bar works wonderfully; I had my doubts just like everyone else, and was worried that this would remove the build up but leave the hair overly squeaky clean and stripped, and if it would later at all. To my surprise this small disc turns into an avalanche of bubbles once I wet it and rub it between the hands. I also wet my hair and rub the bar all over, working with the lather form my hands and the lather from the wet bar. I have to admit that this produces more lather than liquid shampoos and washes the hair without leaving it feeling like it was tortured, instead its slippery and wonderfully light. Afterwards I follow with the American Cream conditioner (probably the best hair scented product in the universe) also from Lush for a head of hair that feels rich and buttery soft, with a fresh light fragrance that lingers on.

The scent itself is wonderful, citrusy and earthy, with Patchouli Oil, Orange Oil, Lavendin Oil, Pine Oil , Lemongrass Oil , Elemi Oil , Gardenia Extract and the Roman Chamomile Flower. I often find that all the oils and rich botanicals nourish the hair and leave it feeling happy, organic and natural products have been of high interest to me lately because of the results they deliver for bouncy hair and supple skin. After using drugstore and even expansive brands of hair products and skin potions, I find that my skin and hair never really benefited from all those preservatives and unnatural products derived from mineral oils and god knows what else. Lush and Burt's Bees, Jason and The Body Shop made me change my mind and seek out products that are as good as they smell, and that truly transform me from a sleepy duckling in the morning to a happy princess by the time my morning routine is over.

I JUST got out of the shower a minute ago, and I must say this is the best shampoo I've ever bought. My scalp hasn't felt this clean and fresh in a long time. Washing my super-thick and waist length hair didn't feel like a chore for once, and I actually look forward to my next washing. The smell reminds me of the hippie shops on Haight Street in San Francisco. I love it

For a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is MAC. Lipglass feels good on your lips, as if it contained some emollients. And (this is a big AND) it's not tacky or sticky. 

The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. 

Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. 

Enjoy!

I received this a a gift for Valentine's Day this year.  It's a nice bubble bath with lots of foam (rather than big, double bubbles).  It's chock full of natural ingredients and no SLS so it's very gentle- even for little ones.  I do however prefer the Deep Steep in the calming lavender chamomile or energizing rosemary mint.

I love the scent of the Grapefruit-Bergamot bubble bath.  This combination is suitable for men or women.  Deep Steep products are really first rate.  The foot scrub and lotions are well worth the money

I used to sell Iman when it was in a major department store.  This stuff would fly off the shelves.  Too bad it was hardly ever in stock which made many customers go to something else.  I stuck with it for 10 years now and would not dare use anything else!  Buy it - you will not be disappointed

I have been using i-man line of products for the past 5 years, and have been a very happy customer. This is my first time shopping for i-man makeup online and I realize that Amazon.com has it for half price. This is a fantastic deal and the product is beautiful for all skin tone. My friends comment that I look flawless.

Knowing how I love everything pink, a dear friend of mine gave this to me as a present. I love the scent, it's not overpowering but has that lovely and alluring smell. It's so fragrant and I feel like I'm forever in a garden full of freshly-bloom beautiful pink roses. 

One of the simple pleasures in life - Truly Pink by Vera Wang. 

Leave a scent of you behind. 

Wholeheartedly recommended.

Face Oasis isn't like any other moisturizer I've tried - One application makes my skin appear plump and well-hydrated even if I've neglected to drink my 8 glasses of water that day.  It isn't at all greasy, absorbs quickly, and serves as a great base over which to apply my makeup. The guys I've introduced it to have raved about it as well!

I have thick in-between wavy and straight hair that is also dry and frizzy. Other curl enhancing lotions I have tried have made my hair feel crunchy, hard and sticky, yuck! Not this one. After I wash and condition my hair I apply this spray to almost dry hair, scrunch it and let it air dry. It gives my otherwise limp, frizzy waves definition, lift and bounce. It even adds shine and smells great, sort of like watermelon. It also looks more natural and is much easier than having to use a curling iron. The spray is easy to use and you can't really use too much of it, which is a problem I've had with other products. In between washes I just spray my hair with water and scrunch it to reactivate the waves.

I always liked the way my hair looks after a swim in the ocean and drying in the sea breeze. Unfortunately I couldn't do that every day but now I can get the look with Fekkai's Wave Creating Spray. The underneath part of my hair has some natural curl and waves. I spray it on damp hair, scrunch and air dry and although it doesn't dry in a toussle of Renaisannce waves and perfect (bong!) ringlets, it really amps up the curls and waves and gives me that beachy look. There' not a crunch factor either although if you keep spraying it on dry brushed out hair the hair can tend to get dryed out. It does add spring and holds well. I don't know how it would work on very straight hair since the top part of my hair doesn't want to respond much. But it works nicely on enhancing what Mother Nature gave you.

So I was a little suspicious of this product at first; eye creams seem to be the most benign things on the market.  When the beauty consultant put this on my face I let her just to be obliging not really expecting anything.  We continued to talk about her products and I realized that I was feeling burning under my eyes (not painful just noticeable) and she said :"See look it is working already!"  I looked and saw nothing but it felt good and she was kinda high pressure so I bought it.  When I got to the car and looked at myself I could see a definite improvement.  The skin under my eyes was tighter, it was still dark under my eye but without all the baggage it was much improved.  So I think that if I use this product and put my concealer on over it I am going to notice a huge difference.  Highly recommended

i'm so happy that this product finally made its way here in the states. i was introduced to this particular brand a few years ago by a friend when i went to visit her in osaka, and i've been hooked since.

i'm one of those unfortunate few who for some reason or the other always end up with "panda eyes" at the end of the day due to mascara run-off. i've tried everything from cheap to expensive, and from regular to waterproof mascaras to no avail. somehow though, this mascara, because of the unique properties of the fibers will not smudge on the skin, no matter how humid or wet the day is. the cool thing about it is that if you rub your eyes the fiber will fall, but not stain the skin, thus eliminating the panda eye effect. the fibers will coat the eyelashes and dry up, forming a sort of tube around the lashes and are surprisingly easy to clean at the end of the day, no special solutions needed. when you clean your eyelashes you can actually see the fibers loosen up and leave your lashes without any residue.

i am also a contact lens wearer and this product, unlike many other mascaras, doesn't irritate my eyes and lasts practically forever.

this has to be the best mascara i have used yet, and that is saying something. even the expensive department store and specialty mascaras pale next to this. and i even bought it at a local japanese drugstore!

never leave home without it; it's possibly the last mascara you'll ever need

I was a bit weary at trying a Shampoo Bar, but as soon as I took a whiff of this little hockey-puck of sunshine, I was sold.  The scent is strong - so watch out if strong florals give you headaches - so strong, in fact, I can smell the jasmine and honeysuckle wafting out of the shower at this very moment.  When I had it in the bag, fresh from purchase, it scented the entire living room!  The conditioning agent isn't enough for people who use deep conditioners -  I recommend following up the shampooing with a seperate conditioner.  But the Fragrance and ease of rubbing a bit of soap onto wet hair, achieving masses of luscious lather, a quick rinse and go - Priceless!  This is definately a little gem that everyone should try

HI

<review_text>
I work retail so I'm on my feet for hours at a time.  Throughout the day, my feet sweat (yes, gross I know... but there's no smell), so gave LUSH's T For Toes a try.  I noticed a huge difference the first time I tried it.  For my whole shift, I wasn't able to feel any moisture on my feet at all!!  My feet and toes felt as fresh as it did when I first started work.  

The dusting powder is made with real Tea Tree oil, so it works as an antibacterial agent as well.  It's supposed to handle stinky feet as well, and my boyfriend swears by it.  He works construction and uses it everyday and loves it because it's not girly smelling and even the packaging is not girly, so he doesn't mind leaving it at work.

T for Toes is a wonderful product and you only need to use a real little bit

Like most others, I fell for all the hype that convinced me that every couple of years, I had to buy the latest, greatest design in razors.  With each new design, the blades got more and more expensive until I realized that it was just a gimmick to get more of my hard earned money.  About a year ago, I bought a Merkur razor and have not regretted it.  If you are a newbie to this type of razor, you may want to start off slow and make minor changes to your technique.  Then, enjoy your smooth shave and think about what to do with the extra money in your pocket

I have hard facial hairs (Thanks Dad!!) and after being Gilette user (last used Mac 3), I finally decided to go back to classic style of shaving with Double Edge (DE) razor and blades. Merkur are the first ones I have used after the multi-edge blades and after 4-5 shaves, I am getting closer shaves (w/ no irritation) than by using mutli-edge ones. Also, to get better results, I would recommend a "Badger" brush which really softens the skin before these DE blades with a good heavy razor (Merkur is a good one) can smoothly get your facial stubs. Good luck !

This is the second time I have ordered these blades for my husband. He has a very heavy beard and says these are the only razor blades he's ever used that last anywhere near this long, regular blades dull almost right away (sorry he's not here or I'd ask for the details from him, I don't know how long "a long time" is) but at 50, he's tried a lot of blades! He says never buy him anything else again so I guess these are the best!!!

With the advent of those truly ridiculous multiblade "shaving systems" (oh, no--not "razors"; they're "shaving systems." Feh.), Merkur blades are a welcome standby. They can be had by the full case (20 10-blade packs) for about $80 or $90. And at about a week per blade, even with "two-pass" shaving (once with the grain of the beard and once against it), that's enough for a few years.

I've been using Merkur blades for almost 25 years, and for overall quality and value, I'd say they're the best around. I've found them best when teamed with the Merkur "Progress" adjustable razor. Using both correctly furnishes the best shave next to a straight razor, and without all of the trouble (well, "enjoyment" for the straight razor aficiandoes) inherent in that practice.

This luxurious milky, creamy and rich cream smells like an island made of coconuts, not overly sweet but luscious and truly indulgent, it pours out and can be used with scrubbing gloves ( also sold by The Body Shop) or simply on it's own to envelop the skin in a coat of soft cleansing lather.

This product has actual coconut oil which I also use on it's own, my boss who is a gorgeous Indian woman gets me coconut oil from her local supermarket and she told me to heat it up in the microwave for 15 seconds and then apply to dry hair, massaging into the scalp and letting it sit as long as I can before shampooing out twice to find my hair shiny and luxuriously full of volume and softness. The same oil is really amazing on the skin, not only does it smell like coconut milk with powdered milk mixed together but is wonderful on dry winter days when my skin wants to turn red and be irritated.

Fabulously creamy and comforting this indulgent cream settles me in for a cozy and warm night, because there's nothing better than a warm shower with a great product that makes me want to jump into a clean, fuzzy bed and dream of sweet things.

This product is awesome; nice texture, great tingling feeling, and very smooth/clean feeling after use. But I'm not sure if you should use it daily, as exfoliators should only be used 2-3x/week because they're too abrasive. So just remember that. Otherwise, this is definitley a top notch exfoliator.

I wasn't so sure about the claims that this shampoo bar would make my hair super shiny, but I didn't really care either way because it smells very nice and I just like relaxing while I try to wake up (or wind down) in the shower. Anyway, it did make a difference! My hair has been noticeable shinier while using this stuff, though I would try Lush's "BIG" shampoo if you want to see an even bigger difference.

Perfect format for brining with you to the gym or travelling - nothing to spill! Make sure you get one of the little travel tins to bring with you so it doesn't soap everything in your gym/travel bag :)

My only complaint is that it only lasted about a week for me. I have medium-long hair, and didn't use that much. I haven't tried my other shampoo bar yet, so I don't know if that's more of a problem just for this particular bar, or if it's a problem across the board. Read the reviews and find out!

like all lush shampoo cakes, it does a great job in cleaning hair and is nice and sudsy. I find the smell to be nothing to write home about. Yes, my hair was shiny, but it tends to be with all of their products. Don't be scared of the glitter though, it's barely there.....all in all, I prefer New and Karma Komba to this one.

During the winter months I have flaky skin under my beard and on my face.  This product has prevented that problem the last 3 winters that I've used it.  I'd recomend for that use.  I don't think it has much of a scent at all.  Certainly not like most soaps and skin care products.

As someone who really dislikes making up, but needs a bit of cover in her face powder, I have found Clinique's Superpowder to be just the right product. I have been using it for nearly ten years. In between Superpowder purchases I have tried other lesser brands and have always returned to this product. It is truly no muss, no fuss. No foundation, or concealers, just a nice simple matte powder that sets in naturally. No powdery bits sitting on the skin surface, no flaking ... and stays on all day with nary a touch up ... just perfect

This cologne smells great. A guy I know wears it and whenever he hugs me I smell this and well, he smells fantastic. In fact, the way he smelled was one of the first things that interested me in him. I'm a big fan of the original Curve cologne, which smells really nice as well...boys/men can't go wrong wearing either of them

I've heard lots of stories about people using beer on their hair and I will admit to trying it once. Cynthia Sylvia Stout is a much more pleasant experience with beer blended with fresh lemon juice, cognac oil and lemon oil. It looks a little like a chocolate syrup and I didn't think it had a very strong beer scent. 

Strangely enough, the scent sort of reminds me of freshly made whole wheat yeast dough (perhaps with a hint of lemon zest), which is currently baking in my bread baker. This is a very cleansing shampoo that you might want to use when your hair is misbehaving and needs a little shine and control. You may only need to shampoo once since this really cleans well the first time. 

Using this with the Veganese conditioner will leave your hair feeling super clean and not overly conditioned. If you want a deeper conditioning experience, try American Cream conditioner which is simply intoxicating. Please don't make me live without it! 

While I enjoyed using Cynthia Sylvia Stout shampoo, I still think my first love is Rehab shampoo (the scent of Rehab is divine). This shampoo did make my hair feel silky and soft so I'll definitely buy it again.

I am a big Lush fan - but Cynthia Sylvia Stout shampoo is my favorite product!

It does smell VERY strongly of beer when you use it, so if you have an aversion to that smell, you won't like this.  At first I didn't like the smell, but now I think it's sort of a nice "wake up."  I don't smell it on my hair when it's dry as other reviewers have noticed - although I use (non-Lush) conditioner afterwards, so maybe that tends to wash the smell away?

This shampoo makes my hair SO shiny.  I have long blonde hair, and it really makes it glow like nothing else.  I don't know how it does it...but people will literally come up to me and comment on how nice and shiny my hair looks on the days I use this product!  

Oh, and this shampoo is very concentrated - a little goes a long way.  So, think of it as though you're getting twice as much when factoring the price in.  It's still expensive, but I think it's a great product when you need a little splurge

This shampoo totally fulfilled its promise of bright, shiny hair for me. I have nice hair to begin with (if I do say so myself), but I used this in conjunction with one of Lush's conditioners(American Cream)and my friends told me I had shampoo model hair that day. I'm not crazy about the beer-ish smell,which is why I'll give it a four rating.However, it doesn't seem to be very strong once you wash it out and the benefit is worth it

i have terrible skin, lots of scars, stretch marks, burns, bruises, acne, etc.  but people always come up to me &amp; comment on how beautiful my skin is (due to the makeup). dermablend is way too dry(i like to mix it with a little lotion before applying) but it stays on even in water. if it looks a bit flaky/pale/ghostly put some lotion over it. any type of makeup looks bad if you don't know how to apply it.

I'm a sort of sweaty type, so I usually like an antiperspirant/deodorant, but sometimes the antiperspirant ingredients give me a rash, and it's really not practical to use them all over everywhere on every single part of your body that might get whiffy. Aromarant is quick and easy to use, doesn't make you itchy or rashy no matter where you use it, and works so well as a deodorant that it makes you want to do an infomercial for it free of charge

Does anyone remember being told that freckles were beauty marks? Do believe I was told this numerous times as I tried eveything to banish the light spray of freckles across my nose. Well, those nose freckles did eventually disappear but in their place came sun spots on my hands.
Gardening is one of my hobbies, and I love to be out of doors. I know, I know - wear garden gloves. For me, digging in the dirt isn't enjoyable in gloved hands. Hence, sun spots.

Over a period of weeks Cellex-C Fade Away Gel has markedly faded the most obvious spots. It isn't oily so I apply the gel to the sun spots twice a day, in the morning and at night. 

By remembering to apply sunscreen to my hands before going outside I think I'll be able to maintain the beneficial effects of this gel.

I recieved a couple of these while in college as a gift and have been using them ever since.  Up until now I have aways had a hard time finding them.  I have been usinghte same two for years now and I gotta tell you, washclothes come and go but these still look almost new after all these years.  I am  so glad I can stock up on these!!  Buy them, you will ove them.  I have ultra sensitive skin and these washclothes are outstanding for exfoliating

I love this cleanser!!! I have combination skin and I sometimes have breakouts, especially when I am stressed. This cleanser is great because it sloughs off the dead skin without irritation. I also love how it doesnt dry out my skin! And I have a lot less breakouts now, and when I do, its not as bad as it used to be. Even if you have sensitive skin, this cleanser is perfect, of course there are other great cleanser options if you think this will irritate your skin. Also, this cleanser really helps to minimize/clean out your pores. I really noticed a difference after using it for only a week.
I also recommend the Perfecting Lotion especially if you have slightly oily skin. I use it during the day and even at night(!)because it really improves my skin and I dont wake up with zits in the morning :)Plus, It saves me money since i dont have to by an acne treatment gel to put under my lotion

lipstick going. This review is for the Guava Stain shade. I first bought this lipstick, I believe in the mid to late eighties. I was delighted with it then and am now. It is sheer, light, non greasy and the color never changes. The color is NOT neutral, but I find that I can wear it with almost any color of clothing except primarily pink or red outfits. Over the years it has become just about the only lipstick shade I wear. I would buy different brands,different shades and wear them maybe once then back to Guava Stain. It along with Clinque's soft pressed blush in New Clover, orginally bought about the same time as the lipstick have become my favorites, and the one's I reach for time and again. They are my dependables. Daytime wear for sure, not night, this is a subtle sheer color

For those with dry, tight and thirsty skin or perhaps for any phases and changes in the texture and comfort level of their usually good skin this is the balm of the Gods as I call it. The cream comes in a slick white tube with a gold and orange stripe at the top and can be squeezed out like toothpaste as the thick metal tube lets me get to the very last bit at the end, a total bonus since I hate wasting product.

Expensive, but well  worth it since Dr. Hauschka products are extremely natural and healing in their properties with no harsh chemicals disguised by pink dyes and fragrances. This cream smells like a pale pink Bulgarian rose garden, something I got to experience as a child as it makes me smile twenty years later as I used this cream. Winter and high times of stress or freaky dry skin episodes are the usual scenarios that would require me to use this cream as I usually stick to my favorite green tube of Cetaphil lotion as my day and night moisturizer ever since I got it from my dermatologist who did wonders to my complexion two years ago.

Great as a face cream and also wonderful as eye cream, especially when the computer I use at work always seems to suck any moisture form my eye area right out. This patted right on top of makeup refreshes and plumps up the skin, and only a tiny bit is needed. This cream lasts for months so at this price it's really a bargain considering that what I put on my face always shows up as results or neglect if the wrong product is use.

Subtle yet powerful! I LOVE this scent. I actually used the entire bottle instead of using half of the bottle, getting sick of it and then purchasing a new fragrance.  Many compliments from men &amp; women. A little spritz does the trick! You can also purchase a sheer moisturizing  body spray. Perfect for daytime wear ~ especially during the summer.  Pricey, but definately worth it!!

...if you don't use this stuff! After too many years of uncomfortable shaves and having to wait 2-3 days between shaving to let my raw, sore neck recover, I finally started to do some research into what I could add to my regimen/technique to improve results. I read numerous articles about the benefits of pre-shave oil, so I decided to add this stuff to my arsenal...and I'm NEVER going back.

First off, the price might be a detrement to those who are used to $3/can drug store shaving cream, but a little goes a long way, and this little bottle might actually last you longer than 4 or 5 cans of cream or gel. You only use a small amount each day, and it spreads evenly over your whole face. When used in tandem with a good shaving cream, it virtually eliminates razor burn and uncomfortable shaving. My razor glides over my face each morning now. If you look at your razor each morning with disgust like I used to, give this stuff a shot. I guarantee you won't be disappointed. Try their shaving cream and "old school" shaving brush as well. Pamper your face...this is how shaving was supposed to be before cheap aerosol shaving cream and disposable plastic razors started ripping our faces to shreds

I am actually an employee for L'Occitane (pronounced Lox-ee-tahn; that's the question i get asked every day! lol). I have only been working for the company at their Santa Barbara store for about 2 weeks, and this is what I've learned about the Artemesia Shampoo: This IS the shampoo that ALL Four Season's Carry. The packageing may seem different if you were at a four season's in another country, but this is the ONLY shampoo of ours that they carry (once in a while people dont believe me, but TRUST me- they train us on which one it is).  People come in everyday for this shampoo because they loved it so much at the four seasons.  In fact, the company SOLD OUT and our store (which ran out quickly because there is a four seasons in Santa Barbara) had many unhappy customers because they couldnt find it.  The scent is heavenly and lasting on your hair. Some other products you might want to try out? The four Seasons also carrys our Verbena Shea Soap, Verbena body lotion, and our Lavender linen water (which makes clothes smell great when used in ironing). Also, just to let you know, this week we're getting new products for our Honey line (btw- try the honey body balm- I'm HOOKED) including a cleanser, milk bath, and honey massage nectar. Hope this information helps some of you- Enjoy!

I bought this conditioner for my daughter's hair.  The smell is WONDERFUL!!!  Plus, the product works GREAT!!!  It now comes with a pump, at least mine did, which makes it easy to use.  It leaves my AA daughter's hair soft and managable

I have tried many different products and this one is the best. I rely on it for many years already and it always works faster than anything else I have tried. Four Stars because it leaves a thin barely but visible film on the skin where you apply it. You can gently blend it with a facial brush after it dries so then its no problem. Especially if under makeup

       Powdered eye shadows have not been high on my list of must-haves, primarily because they  tended to crease in a few hours and looked a bit artificial.   What a happy surprise to find Paula Dorf's Eye Color Glimmer that comes in powder form but is actually creamy so that it goes on smoothly and does not crease.

	Her line of Glimmer shadows have a hint of gold in them - not too much but just enough for a sun kissed effect.  Another plus for these Glimmer shadows is that they can also be used to contour or line.  For lining simply use a moistened eye liner brush.

	There's a lovely palette of shades to choose from depending upon day or dramatic evening wear.  "Nymph" is an appealing innocent blue, while "Hypnotic" is ready for a night on the town

What a great modern selection of elegant colors and what a perfectly textured eye shadow. Paula Dorf says "Where are the brights? Not here" and calls the shadows "softly muted". That is true but don't take that to mean there is no life to this shadow. It's also named Glimmer and it does have a slight velvety glimmer to it. The selection of very wearable colors has a shade for everyone. I bought the gold, which is subtle but is still gold. I love the way it goes on and it's suitable for day or night. Paula Dorf will never have you looking like a clown but I don't find these shades boring either.

I absolutely love this Chanel foundation.  It is lightweight and yet provides fair to good coverage.  I like this foundation because it does not feel heavy and it is water-based.  It can be worn in the daytime or evening.  Use with Chanel loose powder and Chanel concealer for a perfectly flawless finish

For a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is MAC. Lipglass feels good on your lips, as if it contained some emollients. And (this is a big AND) it's not tacky or sticky. 

The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. 

Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. 

Enjoy!

Due to the ravages of 60 years worth of gravity, nursing babies, and losing a LOT of weight, the "girls" need a little help. (Actually, they need a LOT of help, but we won't go there!) I have worn bra inserts from the fabric store, the ones that kind of remind you of a shoulder pad. They do the job, but create a line across the bra cup and have to constantly be adjusted during the day. I LOVE the silicone inserts. Iinserted in your bra, they look like the real deal and, since they cling to your skin, they stay in place all day. I call them my "ex-plants!" Love 'em!

I have tried so many products out there to firm up the area under my eyes and nothing has worked.  Initially I was a little skeptical cause of my lack of success with other products.  I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised.  It certainly has improved the look of the skin around my eyes.  It may seem  expensive, but a little goes a very very long way.  Has a nice texture and easily absorbs and not the least big irritating...and I have sensitive skin.  Try it...I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I wasn't

If you need something to get you going in the morning, Shock Therapy will do it.  We're talking major minty shower gel here--your skin will be tingling.  The smell clears the mind and gets the blood flowing to the brain.  A gift note: this would be a good gift for someone who doesn't like flowery bath products; even guys would like this

I use this constantly - I've bought every limited edition of the set that shows up at Sephora.  I don't blend it in though, I dab a line across my top eyelid and let it dry.  Not too much, but it's still so vibrant that a little goes a long way.  I've reccomended this to everyone

This concealer comes in a pencil form, so it is very precise and offers very good coverage.  It stays on well.  It is more waxy and not as soft and creamy as most concealers, so you can put it in a small, precise spot and it will actually stay there.  I have tried many concealers for small blemishes, and this is my favorite.  It comes in enough shades so you can find a good match, which is important

Tend skin was introduced to me for after waxing ingrown hairs.  But, she said the secret was that it stopped itching from mosquito bites and within 24 hrs any pimple and just blooming pimple are gone!!!  I introduced this to friends at work and now everyone uses it.  We all have clearer skin when nothing else ( even pro-active) didn't work

I don't know why nobody else likes this product, but so far it's the only one that works for my ingrown facial hairs..

Yes, it stings a bit when I put it on, but it quickly goes away.
It doesn't dry my skin out, it actually helps get rid of the dry, white-looking flaky skin after I shave.

I used to get ingrown hairs so bad on my face that they would be there for MONTHS. Eventually I'd get to the point of having to do my own surgery with a needle to try and extract the hair.

If I get an ingrown hair now, I just use Tend Skin once in the morning and once before bed, and it actually extracts the hair on it's own! It gets rid of the redness and swelling also associated with ingrown hairs.
For the only time in my life my face actually looks clear, and Tend Skin is the product that has done it for me.

Before I finish, I'd just like to add that I'm the kind of person that NOTHING ever works on. Any product I try, never does as advertised. Whether it be shampoo, deodorant, medication, etc.
Tend Skin is one of the rarities that actually DOES work for me.
And believe me, I've tried a LOT of products for ingrown hairs

I'm sooo happy with all 3 of these scents.  The candy apple is definitely the most accurate and I'd sell my soul if I could only continue buying it on its own.  But the other 2 are good, too.  The cotton candy is awesome but not 100% on accuracy and the cherry sno-cone makes me start slobbering when I smell it.  Highly recommended

This stuff is awesome if you have dry, coarse, or damaged hair.  This is lush, creamy and lathers up well. This is a wonderful luxury shampoo. You will feel like a queen/star when you wash your hair with this. The smells is fresh and yummy. I love using this stuff except I cannot use this every day as it will weigh my hair down. My hair is fine and straight and has some natural wave in the back. I highly recommend this product and will buy it again

I originally wanted the Black Ginger Aromatic Candle, but after reading the reviews it seemed that the Red Currant is the all around favorite.  The smell is nice, but I think I expected something a bit different.  The candle's scent does travel throughout my home like others have stated, and it seems to be burning slowly.  The candle itself is fine quality, and comes packaged nicely!  If I found a scent that I liked a bit better I would be 100% pleased

I have tried every shampoo and conditioner on the market and was dissatisfied with the results until trying this combo. My curls are well formed and bouncy and I use less styling product. Plus this line smells great! It has a light citrusy smell that I wish they'd bottle into perfume. I even got my boyfriend (who has curly hair like mine) to buy and use these products by letting him sample mine. I am hooked

When I was a little girl, I would watch my Mother take her makeup off at her dressing table.  Cold cream and soft cloth tissues.  A gentle misting of water and then another dabbing with cloth.  Then night cream, eye cream ("dab on gently, never rub"), a special lotion for her throat and collarbone area.  She would impart her beauty secrets to me while I sat transfixed.  Although I was convinced that she was the most beautiful woman in the world, I was surprised that with all these lotions and oils, she didn't' slide right out of bed at night.  "Exercise, Sweetheart.  Drink lots of water.  Never go to sleep in your makeup--no matter how tired you are.  Never wash your face with regular soap.  Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize.  Your skin has to last you a lifetime and nothing gives away a woman's age like uncared for skin."  While I am not sure where I would even find 'cold cream' today, I follow the vast majority of her regimen.  The two items that I use for under my eyes are Avon's Repair Eye Serum and Hydrofirming Bio6 Eye Cream.  The cream plumps up and firms the delicate tissue around the eye, and the serum smoothes and moisturizes the skin.

I consider Avon products to be the unsung work horses of the beauty industry.  They almost always do exactly what they say they are going to do and at a very modest price.   Expensive boutique and department store products rarely do a better job and are usually exorbitantly overpriced.   When you factor in that Avon products go on sale regularly (which is when I usually stock up), you are getting an even better deal for your money.  While I am not a complete cheapskate, I love a bargain and I want to feel like I am getting full value for my money.

The skin around the eyes is quite thin and delicate, so I think if you follow my Mother's advice and "dab on gently, never rub" Avon's Repair Eye Serum and Hydrofirming Bio6 Eye Cream you will be able to keep this area smooth, without being greasy, even with the most drying of climatic conditions

I've been using Avon products since I was a teen.  I started using the eye serum a couple of years ago after Avon discontinued their wonderful eye gel.  I will be 60 this year and have no wrinkles around my eyes and few on my face either, though I am a dry-skinned redhead. 

Contrary to what someone else here said, I find that it does absorb very quickly.  I buy it because it is NOT oily--oily makeup around my eyes makes my eyes burn, and this gives me no problems at all.  Also, I have sensitive skin so I have to use hypoallergenic makeup.  This fills that bill too.  Try it!!  It's great!!

I agree with the reviewer who likened it to actual lemon juice.  It is very strong, and I realized after spraying it twice it only needed once... most likely because it is an eau de parfum and not eau de toilette.  Very much worth the money.  I was complimented on it the entire day. It does not resemble lemon Pledge to me at all

I tried the lemon sugar perfume and I am absolutly in love with it. It is like no other perfume I have ever smelled before. I will probably be using it the rest of my life, I hope they never stop making it. I think everyone should try it. The scent is lemony and sugar just like it says. It is light and last a very long time. I am already going to order a bigger bottle tomorrow. Do not just take my world for it, order it today and experience something great and new

I could never expect to like a lemon scented perfume,but this one is definately different.

When i first smelt it in the bottle i thought:"Oh,no!Dish soap!",but when i put it on i immediately loved it.

On me it smells like lemon scented candy.It's so fresh and clean!I couldn't stop smelling my wrist!And everytime i smelt it i felt as if i were in a wet garden and lemon blossoms were falling on my skin!

It was a nice alternative to all my candy scented perfumes.
It lasts a long time too and it's affordable,plus it smells like spring!

The best choise to welcome the hot days of the summer,since it will keep you fresh and cool.

A must buy!

This is a very lemony smell, and the sugar takes away the sour 'edge' of the lemon. It is simply only that-lemon and sugar, then it gets warmer and airy throughout the day.If you want to just try it, get a sample size one from ebay, or a mini perfumes website.If your considering the more expensive Clean fragrance but aren't sure about the price, Fresh Lemon Sugar is similar in scent, the only thing being left out is the laundry, 'air' fragrance

Not your typical thick, floral-smelling perfume, this perfume smells exactly like its name advertises--like lemon juice mixed with sugar.  It's a seasonal perfume (I can't imagine smelling like lemons in the winter).  It smells very crisp, fresh, and clean, which I enjoy a lot, but I imagine others would not; the same things I like about this perfume, could smell like a cleaning product to others.  Go to your fridge.  Get a lemmon, squeeze its juice out into a cup and add some sugar.  If you enjoy the smell you get, buy this perfume--I highly recommend it.  If not, stick to something more traditional and vanilla/floral like Ana Sui's "Dolly Girl"

I buy these in bulk, and have done since my darling sister in law gifted me with a boxful of Lush goodies some years back.  

I have terrible circulation.  I get cold and stay that way.  From time to time I'm also an insomniac.  The Wiccy Massage Bar has a cure for both.  The cinnamon leaf is very warming on the skin and the Aduki beans seem to help this warmth penetrate. (They also fall all over the floor if you're not careful...but you wont care..the bar is THAT good). The oil is thick and lovely - but be careful about rubbing up against anything it may stain.  This is one of the reasons I only ever use it before bedtime.  Who cares if it messes up the Cartman Flannel Pajama bottoms?  

Speaking of bedtime...I'm not sure what it is..whether it's the cinnamon or the other essential oils I can't name, but they have a very calming effect.  Much better than yucky smelling lavender.  Helps me get to sleep in no time flat.  

I rub it on the back of my neck and sometimes, even on the underside of my pillow case, for this soft comfy shut eye

After a long day of hunching over my computer at work for 8+ hours and a brutal workout after, I came home tonight and enjoyed the best shower experience I have ever had by myself with a bath bar!  :)  
The cooling sensation of the wiccy magic muscles bar, the cool air in the bathroom, mixed with the warm water of the shower made for a incredibly relaxing, blissful, enjoyable shower.  
I feel great!  I'll sleep great tonight!  This experience has made me a LUSH customer for life

I havent gotten the treatment myself yet but my husband loves it.  Dont rub it on too long or you'll have too much.  It melts quickly when it touches skin.  I love the peppermint/cinnamon mixture scent and he likes the heat it provides.  It leaves a coating of the buttery stuff on your skin, so wear a shirt to bed so it can soak in and moisturize

I bought this after using other Murad products and loving them. I like this, but I wouldn't say I love it. First, it's a bit overpriced. I can get a comparable drugstore product for a fraction of the price. The toner itself is decent, but doesn't seem to clean as deeply as other toners. However, for those who find toners to be a bit harsh, this may be a good option. Non-drying and doesn't have that toner "burn". Overall, a decent product, but not one I am sure I would re-purchase

So glad to find this hard to find item..!  I have tried every kind of polish dryer.. but it did the surface and left a tacky mess underneath .  For Years.. I have used Dry and Shine with the great success.. It goes on like lotion... drys to a haze and you buff it off to a beautiful hard shine...and... dry nails.. 
  I love it!!!  it is magic!!!!

A Clean and refreshing scent. Not heavy at all - its top notes are citrus based, and this is  appropriate for day or night wear. It is one of my favorites. It reminds me a little of Happy for Women, which I love, but don't wear, because of its distinctly feminine smell. Cudos to Clinique. Happy is a terrific man's cologne, it smells clean but not like laundry soap ( which too many men's colognes smell like these days )

The range of "flavors" makes it easy to give this gift again and again. The order always comes pre-wrapped suitable for gift giving. You can't go wrong with giving this as a gift. I give this seller my highest recommendation! Kudos

I light this candle every other day in my bedroom because I enjoy this scent so much.  It is a very light scent, but the smell does fill a room quickly.  If you like the Amazing Grace and Pure Grace lines from Philosophy you will like the "Clean Crisp White" candle. The candle is high quality and comes in a very nice container that I didn't want to throw away.  Great for gifts

You've bought the cheap ones in the grocery store that sent out the weak scent of, well, grocery store. And some candles smell like spray room deodorizer which smells like what one would use in the toilet which then make you think of poop which is not at all what you were going for in the living room. So then you hit the expensive pretty versions - perhaps even in candle stores with cute waxy names. They are not candles, my friend. They are sculptures. Some fancy ones come with cute packaging and crispy dried flowers. This is when you lose your patience. I DO NOT WANT CRISPY DRIED FLOWERS. I WANT A CANDLE THAT PUMPS A GOOD SCENT ALL OVER A ROOM WHEN I LIGHT IT.

This is it. Votivo. You will walk into the room and that room will smell like the candle. The most universally loved scent is probably Red Currant. I also enjoy Rain. The little glass it comes in makes a cute vase after the candle is done. Plus, they make perfect last minute hostess gifts, as the box is very nice and expensive-looking.

So, Votivo isn't the cheapest candle in the world. They're still cheaper than buying a bunch of cheap candles that stink...weakly stink.

Tweezerman tweezers are by far the best tweezers I've ever purchased. They stay sharp for an incredibly long time making tweezing precise, quick and virtually painless. And when they do go dull, all you have to do is send them in for a free sharpening and in a week or so, they arrive back good as new. You can't beat that!

I'm sure that you don't need any more assurance, but just to let you know, I've had my tweezerman's for over 5 years now. They are still sharp! Plus if you ever were to drop them, they probably wouldn't be significantly damaged. These tweezers are a must have.

Tweezerman tweezers are simply put - The Best - with capital letters!  I bought my first pair at Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond 2 years ago and I just now broke down to buy another pair because I couldn't even go without them long enough to send them in to be sharpened for free! I tell all my friends (and after one use of mine, they agree) that once you use a Tweezerman you realize that no other tweezers out there even come close to their quality or how well they work.  I have had to fight them out of the clenched fists of quite a few of my friends who have wanted to borrow them. How many times do you make "Rules" for a pair of tweezers?  My number one rule? You can use them, but not take them out of my presence!!  Definitely worth the money - in spades!

The pictures posted here of the Paul &amp; Joe blotting paper compact don't do it justice. The compact is very beautiful, large and all covered in a pretty flower-patterned material. Very feminine, very stylish, very pretty. My only complaint? I wish it had a snap or something so it'd stay closed instead of only folding...

The price is a bit steep at first but fortunately, they did consider refills at an affordable price. In my experience, I haven't found different brands of blotting paper to be very different amongst themselves and this is no exception, it gets the job done adequately, only in a prettier package...

As far as blotting goes, this one blots shine like it should but get it for the stylish case and the convenience of affordable refills

I got this as a gift from my mother last year.  This product saved my hands and feet!  It helped them stay soft.  No more itchy ankles or knuckles.  I preferred to use this at night, but I do use it on my feet almost everyday before I put my socks on for the day.  It moisturizes without too heavy of a feeling

Givenchy's Very Irresistible is magnificent!  Floral, yet spicy overtones with a touch of black current in a rose peony base.  Better than Bob Mackie's "Perhaps" perfume. And infinitely complex, so that the scent is never tiresome.  Irresistible lasts all day and is a fragrance that captivates.  This perfume is different than the typical scents that arrive on the market and well worth a try!

I have shoulder length natural dredlocs and while this didn't lock my hair it did smooth out the flyaways around the crown of my head.  It also has a great light scent that doesn't compete with the other hair care products I use like the vanila leave-in conditioner and the hair butter

This stuff is sooo great. This three-pack set gives you the creme de la creme in men's skincare. The shampoo is wonderful and actually prevent hair loss. The body wash is my favorite...its smells awesome. The after shave is fantastic...soothing and refreshing. I suggest this pack for those who've never used Billy Jealousy or those loyal followers such as myself...this is also a great was for someone to get introduced to Billy Jealousy, this has all the essentials. You will not be displeased, in fact you'll be in awe...you'll be compelled to tell everyone, this also makes a great gift. Billy Jealousy is the absolute best and I've used all upscale lines from department stores, Sephora, and spas...and this stuff is the best

I love this conditioner! It smells divine and it made my hair feel like silk! My hair is ash blonde and i noticed a very slight lift in colour. Regardless, I recommend this product highly, especially for dry, damged hair. I recommend this product in conjunction with "NEW! (Hair) Solid Shampoo Bar", also made by Lush Cosmetics

Got this sample from a friends mom who worked for a major department store..and I loved it...but I couldn't believe it was a scent from Clinique!

Love that it's light and has little hints of powder and citrus to it.

I definitely recommend this scent...especially for the Springtime.

Great for daytime wear

I purchased the TUI shampoo and conditioner and although it is watery it lathers very well and leaves your hair squeaky clean. I wear my hair natural with no chemicals and it held my natural curls in place the entire day, my hair did not dry out nor did it become poofy all day.

I was so surprised by this eyeshadow. I usually buy cheap brands from the drugstore but when I tested this on my hand I had to have it! Be Mine is a light, shimmery pink paired with a soft charcoal. Pink usually looks weird on me but this shadow is so soft, smooth and lightweight that it glides on and doesn't look cakey. Since I bought this I hardly wear any of the cheap stuff I own. This is worth the price and now I'm saving up to buy a few more shades

One whiff of this delicious soap and you are transported to a land of pine trees where plates of freshly sliced oranges are served on a bed of lemongrass, surrounded by patchouli candles. This is the best way I can describe the scent that seems to awaken from the night and mingle with memories of exotic honey and wide-open skies. I am not sure where I go when I inhale deeply, but I am no longer in the shower. Follow this with the Skin Sin lotion and you will enter a little bit of heaven on earth. Also delicious to use in a bath with sea salts and patchouli, orange slices optional, but you might crave the taste of oranges while using this soap.

This is my favorite soap in the whole, wide world. It makes me happy when I use it. It smells fresh, like the wind, the ocean, grass, sand. I don't know, it's just the perfect scent. I have both the "karma kream" lotion and karma dusting powder from Lush, and I love them as well, but the soap is still my favorite. Next time I go to their store I'm going to buy the biggest brick of this stuff that I can, because it's great! Just a simple gylcerine-based soap with a dark orange-red hue, but the smell is just so wonderful that every time I wash my hands it turns into some sort of new-age deep-breathing exercise while I try to get as much of that lovely scent into my nostrils as I can.

I've found that this soap lathers better than others, but you have to be careful not to leave it in the shower all the time, or it will get soft and melt away with the condensation. Trust me, you don't want to waste any of this stuff by letting it leak into the drain while other people are using the bathroom! I leave mine out so it can make my bathroom smell really great as an added bonus :)

Fresh, fruity, citrusy, with just a tiny hint of patchouli to give it an earthy note. Definitely a winner from Lush! As soon as I smelled this soap in their store for the first time, I loved this scent. As you can tell from the reviews, a lot of other people do, too

worth every penny. someone gave this red currant soap as a house warming gift and i became obsessed. i really cannot tell you how good of quality these products are. the candles burn forever and really scent the place up, but not in an ovepowering fake way. i can't wait until they make body perfume in red currant. all of them smell good however.

Ive never liked spicy or musky scents, but Im in love with Burberry Brit.  Its got a great musky overtone but its not too heavy like most fragrances like it.  The scent sticks around all day which is also a plus.  I've a;ways used light scents like Romance by Ralph Lauren and CK One but Burberry Brit is easily my new favourite...Im actually here to buy my second bottle..

This is just incredible. Many subtle layers of scents, non of them too strong or overpowering, despite the fact that this will stay with you all day long ( no need to respray, in other words, so it's a great value for the price ). I had  never tried a Burberry product before and quite honestly bought this on a whim because I was running low on cologne ( yes, I'm one of those types who has to wear something different every day ) and wanted to try something different. I am happy to say there is really nothing I can compare it too - and that's a good thing, it's not "samey" like so many men's fragrances out today, and not feminine at all. Very nice.

If you ever wondered what it would be like to wander in a field of violets, then this shampoo gives a lush interpretation of what it would be like to walk through one of Raymond Gehman's photographs. 

The deep purple color is remnicent of crushed blackberries and the scent is a mingling of lemon, coconut, Bergamot and violets. The truth is, this shampoo is one of the best shampoos Lush sells and I think it gives even more body and texture than Rehab. Use this and follow with the Coolaulin conditioner for shiny bouncy hair that is scented with violets and coconut. 

The fragrance follows you around for hours and envelops you in a comforting warmth. This shampoo may have you dreaming about the Purple Haze gift box filled with violet, lavender and blackcurrant items or looking into the "Gratuitous Violets" soap. 

To complete the experience, you may want the "Smitten" hand cream - quite luxurious and comforting. For some reason, the All That Jas bath item worked well with the violet scent so my house is now scented with Jasmine and Violets and I feel like I'm walking in fields of flowers.

This is alittle "heavier" than usual summer skin products, ie
light, and non greasy, but when you are maintaining your tan and or recovering from skin peeling, this cream is rich and works great!  The ingredients are rich and they really make the skin feel smooth.

This is a treat to wear, I alternate it with my Secret Sparkling Lily clear gel deodorant. The Fresh deodorant doesn't dry my skin and my it rubbery feeling but it keeps me from sweating. It smells just like Fresh's Sugar perfume, sweet and lemony, but doesn't last as long, that's why I only gave it 4 stars. It also doesn't cake or pill up like other deodorants. This is my favorite deodorant

This lip gloss is so wonderful, I don't know where to start.  Long lasting shine, perfect color, goes on smooth-doesn't feel sticky or gummy like some glosses do, mild fruity flavor.  I HIGHLY recommend this lip gloss to anyone-the expense is worth it 100X over

I have been using this mascara for years.  I have tried other brands--drugstore varieties as well as department store varieties and have been disappointed with everything else I have ever tried.  Why?  This mascara is smooth; it does not flake off and fall into your eyes.  It does not ever look clumpy.  It is also easy to remove without losing any eyelashes.  I would not say that this mascara will make your lashes "a mile long" or "dangerously thick" or whatever hype you hear from other brands.  Those kinds only ever look like clumpy mascara.  Just a simple nice, natural looking mascara that won't irritate your eyes

This gel-based mascara does an excellent job of creating long, separate, and well defined but natural lashes. If you like your mascara to have some oomph to it, you would want to look elsewhere. For those who can't stand a single clump, you may have found your new favorite! If you've ever gotten a mascara in a slender green tube in a Clinique 'gift with purchase' - this is the one. The one you buy is in a slender and slightly larger silver tube.  You can brush on coat after coat of this gel like wonder and not get a single clump! Wow! This mascara is fiber-free and has been opththalmologist approved for contact lens wearers. The Jet Black is a true black and the Jet Brown is noticeably brown on the wand but looks great on the lashes. As with all long wearing eye makeup products such as mascara, this one needs to be removed with an eye makeup remover.

I don't remember when I first tried this product, but now I've been using it for years and I love it! This is a great eye color base. It goes on smoothly, without rubbing or pulling the skin, and provides a smooth base for powder eye color. I wear it every day under my eye makeup. It makes my eyeshadow last all day without creasing or fading. Plus it comes in many colors to compliment whatever colors of eyeshadow you're wearing. Try it, and you'll love it too

This product is GREAT!!!

I wear it during the day under my moisturizer but the biggest difference is when I put a drop or two on at bedtime. One night I was really beat, too beat to wash my face so I tried putting a little on over everything instead. It worked great. When I wear it at night, my skin looks dewy and fresh and soft like I'm 19 again! (I'm almost 40!) 

I can't say that everyone will have the same results I do. All I know is that I am very, very happy to have found this product!

Great product from a company that only offers innovative wonderful products- this product shouldn't cost this much though.  It costs less at authorized Bb. retail outlets and buying Bb. products online doesn't guarantee the consumer that they're getting authentic Bb., so beware.   Check out www.bumbleandbumble.com for authorized retailers

     I love the shine lip glosses offer but really do dislike the stickiness.  When wearing a gloss lip prints come off on glasses (paper cups are the worst!), napkins, and whoever you've just buzzed.

      Found the answer to the stickies with Chanel's Aqualumiere line.  The lipsticks give the slick shine without the telltale spots.  It can be blotted and still shines.  As if that weren't enough it's SPF15.

     My favorite shade is "Macao," a rosy pink

Only  drawback. It stays wetter on

i.e., AFTA, which dries quickly so you
can get to shaving quicker.

Inis has a very fresh/crisp/clean scent that I love.  It's kind of a subtle scent and not overpowering, which is what I like about it.  It's also very androgynous so a man or woman could wear it.  Whenever I wear it people always sniff and make comments like "what are you wearing?" and "mmm! you smell so good.

Inis has become my favourite perfume, every time I wear it I am always being asked "What perfume are you wearing?" It is light, fresh &amp; fragrant, not overpowering but makes an impression. I have tried lots of perfumes but none compare to Inis. The fact it is not tested on animals is a bonus and also it is not too expensive. Can't recommend it enough. Buy and try

Our local Macy's recently offered free skin typing and the samples to go with it. I really only went to pick up a free moisturizer as I've found with some judicious sampling you don't have to pay for that item. Instead, I fell in love with this soap (and got free moisturizer too-hooray!!)

When the sales rep first handed me the bar soap, I balked. I've known people who've used Clinique but just the idea of washing my face with BAR soap freaked me out. They do offer a liquid version but the rep told me the soap was a better exfoliant. I can't say for sure if that's so but I can say this really is a great face wash. I was addicted after one use. And since it is a bar of soap, you'll get a really great sudsy foam. It has a mild, pleasant scent and it washes off easily. I have the mild version and I just love it. My skin feels clean but never tight and not only does it not cause breakouts, it immediately calmed the one I had. I'll definitely be buying more. 

I do want to add, however, it is drying in the wintertime if you have normal skin and I had to switch to a cream cleanser. It may not be a problem for oily skin. For dry skin, I'd really avoid it in the winter at least.

You still ideally need a makeup remover before the soap. I also became a recent convert to Clinique's Rinse Off Foaming Cleanser. But even if you don't want to use that product, remember that removing your makeup is a separate step.

I'd never bought a perfume above ten dollars when I tried Burberry Brit's Eau de Toilette one day. I couldn't believe how wonderful the scent was, especially after it had been on for a while. I splurged on a bottle which seems set to last me for a long time (even with almost-daily use, it's still mostly full). I consider this to be my signature scent, and get many compliments on it

With the texture of an aloe vera gel, this Hibiscus Enriched Aqua-Collagen-Gel smoothes over the skin effortlessly and penetrates the skin to create some stunning results. Not only will your complexion improve, your skin will firm and tighten to reveal a renewed tone. 

The secrets in this formulation include Hibiscus flower extract, Hibiscus fruit extract, Citrus Junos Peel Oil, Bergamot Fruit Oil, Orange Oil, Collagen and Allantoin. This gel is perfect alone if your skin is combination to oily or can be used along with another moisturizer if your skin is dry. The ingredients seem to balance and soothe the skin and also encourage an anti-aging effect. 

The firming and toning of the skin is truly amazing. This is one product you won't want to live without and you can alternate the various Dr. Ci:Labo Collagen Gels to gain the full benefits of each. 

The Super Moisture Moisturizer is also perfect in the driest of winters and would seem to be essential when living in desert conditions. The Super Moisturizer contains Hyaluronic Acid, Aloe, Lobata Root Extract, Flower Extracts, Grape Leave Extract, Sea Salt and Horse Chestnut.

Rice Bran is the secret to these products and the results are immediately apparent in the texture of your skin. After just one to two uses, you start to notice a sense of calm and order descending upon your formerly sensitive skin. Weeks later you look at your skin and it seems like you are at least ten years younger. The smoothness, clarity and youthful glow truly shows with continued use. 

If you have oily or combination skin, you may be amazed at how balanced your skin is and how you no longer experience the shine breakthrough in your makeup due to the initially drying aspects of other cleansers. 

The Komenuka Bijin Facial Cleansing Foam is very economical and an eighth of a teaspoon is enough for a wonderful face cleansing experience. The ingredients include: Rice Germ Oil, Rice Bran, Coconut Oil, Seaweed, Aloe Algae, Ginkgo Biloba, Matricaria, Yeast, Perilla Ocymoides, Honey, Lithospermum and Fountain Water.

The Moisture Cream goes a long way. The main oils are Rice Germ Oil, Jojoba Oil and Olive Oil. Vitamin E, Rice Bran and Aloe make this a skin-healing treat.

Other products to fall in love with: 

Cleansing Powder - Packets of deep cleansing grains turn silky and creamy when you add water. 

Makeup Remover - A fragrance-free cream that removes makeup and mascara. Based on olive oil. 

UV Cream - Slightly tinted and waterproof, this sunblock also seems to even out skin tone. Could be used as a makeup base if you are looking for a more natural look. 

Hair Shampoo &amp; Conditioner - Thickens fine hair instantly. Removes buildup and leaves your hair feeling luxurious. 

Essence - This is a product that is magical. It can be used for skin healing and it also lightens freckles and age spots.

Used the cleansing foam, then bought the moisture cream.  Whatever is in rice bran is truly wonderful, it cleanses without any dryness and a rosy glow has returned to my skin. Have stopped using my old department store stuff, replacing 4 of those products with just these 2 with better results. Good value on both, they should offer a deal on the shampoo and conditioner too

I absolutely love this fragrance.  When I put this on, I get a warm musky scent that lasts for hours.  I put the spray cologne version of Falling in Love on top to brighten it up a bit when I feel like it.  It is subtle, but I think it is a very sexy and warm scent and not at all overpowering.  Definitely something my husband wants to be near

I was unsure about this item in the store- but took a gamble. I cut 1/3 of the bar up and crumbled it and I wasn't particularly impressed with the smell of it dry. So I grabbed the rest and tossed it all in. Wow! It was so silky and smooth against the skin, I jumped out and grabbed my husband to join me! With some nice classical music on in the background and a Tahitian Vanilla candle- you'll think your back in the womb- all safe and warm. The bubbles didn't last very long, but it leaves the skin silky and comfortable with out a perfumey scent

my first thought on crumbling some of this into my running bath was that it reminded me of bubble baths from when i was kid. there's this really nice subtle clean smell to this bubble bar. i really like that it's not an overpoweringly smelly bubble bar. it's great for those who don't want a flowery bath, but who can't tolerate the overwhelming patchouli in the blue skies bar. i wish i'd bought two of these instead of one of this and one of the blue skies. plus, this is a good bar for mixing with a bath bomb. really probably any bomb would do. good stuff

This was my first Lush experience and now I am hooked. Something about the scent of this bubble bar relaxes me like nothing else. It didn't smell like hot (coconut) milk to me - it has a warm, spicy, pleasant scent - but it definitely had that "warm milk before bedtime" effect. And it works miracles on my rambunctious two-year-old daughter. Not only does it produce LOADS of bubbles (fwiw we have an oversized clawfoot tub, and a third of a bar filled it to the top w/bubbles) but the scent seems to calm and relax her as much as me. Warning: don't take this bath if you're planning an evening out! You'll just want to snuggle into bed afterwards

I developed acne after I turned 23 and have had limited success using over the counter products. I purchased the acne kit and it began to clear up my skin, but I would still get the cysts that took for ever to go away or they would never get to the surface. I starting using the oxygen peel one a week and found that it wasn't doing much and that there was a lot of extra get that I had made that was wasted. I talked to the girl at the counter several days ago about this and I had a huge cyst that was very painful. She told my to use the oxygen peel 3 times in a row and that should help. I would be using all the extra gel that was made and would see more results. 
I went home that night and did just as she said. I was amazed to see that the painful cyst had risen to the surface and I was able to relieve the pressure. This is a truely amazing product and would recommend it to anyone who has this same proble

	For a touch of the sun without risking  skin damage the always innovative and practical  Laura Mercier came up with the "Solar Flair" Collection.

	One of my favorites in this line is the Illuminating Stick, an easy way to achieve an instant glow.  The stick is available in two shades, Golden Honey Glow, which provides a subtle bronze luster, and Golden Rose Glow, which very much resembles a natural blush.

	With earth minerals for a lovely luster and shine, the color is applied directly to the skin with fingertips or brush.  It blends smoothly and leaves a soft, velvety texture.

	There's no limit to where it can be used - as a blush on the apple of the cheeks or across forehead, brow bone or chin for a "just in from a day at the beach" look.  For evening my preference is the Honey Glow applied across shoulders as well.

	Key ingredients include Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Vitamin A, and Bismuth Oxychoride, which acts as a light reflector by sun or moonlight

Having shaved with everything from cheapo disposables to Thiers-Issard straight razors, I have to say that the Merkur Progress is probably the best all-around razor available today. It has excellent heft and balance, and the adjustment feature is simple and straightforward. (Although I do agree that the numbered adjustment seems to perform a little differently depending on the blade used.) It is easy to keep clean--assuming you don't mind unscrewing it and taking the blade out to wipe off the head and frame. Having also used a venerable old Gillette "fat boy" from the 1950s, I'd still have to rate the Progress as a better razor; the screw operated adjustment makes it constantly adjustable, not just in steps. 

Since this is a safety razor, its performance is significantly dependent on the blades used. I've tried both the Merkur blades and the Japanese "Feather" blades, and would say that it's a toss-up. 

And since it is an adjustable safety razor, it is perfectly suited to two-pass close shaving. A higher setting is excellent on the first pass with the grain of the beard, and a lower setting for the pass against the grain. The adjustment also allows you to adjust the razor to the conditions of your skin and beard. If you've let yourself get a day's worth of stubble (c'mon--don't we all?) you can set the blade high to mow that hedge. If you need a quick clean-up before a night on the town, you can set it lower for a "Once lightly, James."

So if you want a really well-made, no-nonsense but very versatile razor that will last for a good long time, this is a good bet. The only problem might be preventing pals from swiping it, or reminding your wife/significant other to take it apart to clean it after she smooths up those pretty pins you love so well.

One recommendation: Shop around. You can get these for under $40.00 if you bargain-hunt, likewise full 20-count boxes of carded Merkur 10-blade refill sets

I bought this on a whim because I just remodeled my house after Hurricane Katrina and now have a huge jacuzzi tub...nice to take long baths in so of course I needed some bubble stuff.  The bath bombs smell wonderful.  My whole bathroom smelled of the bath bombs until I used them all.  I even put the box they came in into my closet and it made my closet smell wonderful (for about a week)!  The bombs each have something special inside of them that you find out about when they dissolve.  The fizzing is fun and the smell lingered on my skin until the next day.  I loved them and will definitely buy more

This was my fisrt foray into lip scrubs.  I like the dual concept, with a scrub on one side and a lip balm on the other.  I also like the fact, this slips into you purse or pocket easily, so it's convenient for those on the go.  I took mine skiing in Vail, and it was the first time I didn't come home with chapped lips. 

The textures are good.  The scrub side is slightly grainy, more of a polish than a scrub.  I would not recommend it for heavily chapped lips, but it works well for weekly maintenance. The lip balm side is a little waxy, but moisturizing with vityamin e.  It's quite long-lasting and provides a sweet, natural shine.  This smells of spun vanilla, sweet and sugary. 

Why only 4 stars?  I think Tarte should have added SPF 15 sun protection.  Doing so would provide sweet, kissable lips and the protection you need

I got this as a present, when it finally came back in stock.

The scrub part of the stick does a great job, but you need to have lips that aren't in dire need of help for it to really work.  To do that, just use a moist, soft toothbrush, and gently scrub.  The scrub side will sometimes leave a little sugar behind, so you might have to wipe your lips off a little after you use it, but I found that this doesn't happen all the time.

The balm side goes on smoothly, and feels great.  It's silky feeling, but does not provide a lot of moisture, so, if you lips are on the dryer side,  this is not going to replace your regular gloss.

This stuff is great for on the go, and I will be buying it again when mine runs out

Forget all those other so-called good colognes out there. Happy for Men is the best smelling one of them all! It may be expensive, but it is well worth it. Example: I sprayed down a shirt with it and send it home with my girlfriend at her request! She requested this because she wanted have something of mine that she could sleep with it while we are apart. That is how good it is! Enjoy

for me, Happy has a subtley orange undertone and evokes a sense of vibrancy and youth. As with the signature female clinique scents, you don't need much to cause a stir and it always leaves a lingering, subtle trail of sophistication

I'm not kidding, it's worth every penny (though I must admit that I get it at a lower price from a secret supplier in Asia). After using this, you'll swear that you just got a hot oil/deep treatment done from a professional salon. 

I have chemically treated hair (relaxed, double process - colored &amp; fine hair equals damaged hair), and this is the only conditioner that works for me. Another plus is, this is the only conditioner that elicits "your hair smells sooooo good" reaction from my boyfriend &amp; daughter.

Surprisingly, even if it moisturizes my hair excellently, it still leaves it bouncy &amp; with enough volume.

This lasts about 6 months if you use it once a week, so it's really not that expensive, especially if you substitute this for your regular deep conditioning treatment at the salon.

If you're still wary, try a smaller bottle

The Avobath bath bomb turns water a lovely luminous pale green. Avocado, olive oil, lemongrass, bergamot, rosewood oil, gardenia extract makes this a skin calming, soothing, moisturizing dream. The "green luster" makes this bath especially beautiful and gives it a mermaid mood. I loved this one so much, I'm ordering two the next time. 

The scent is lemon/lime, but by the time you get in the tub, the floral scents are more prominent. You can add in some bubbles, but they don't seem to last very long - well, I was using a bath gel. 

So, you may want to find a bubble bar because the olive oil seems to make them disappear pretty fast. At least, that is my theory because I've noticed bath oil does the same thing. Avobath goes well with Whoosh products or the Happy Hippy Shower gel. If you are in the mood, you might want the amazing "Godiva" shampoo and conditioner 2 in 1 bar (has a magical quality - makes hair super shiny) or the "I love Juicy" shampoo and "Veganese" conditioner. The last two also have a citrus scent and are especially delicious. 

When I use Lush products, I'm in a good mood all week long. It is truly amazing how happy and content I am as long as I have some Lush products around. :)

This cheery green bomb releases the uplifting scent of lemongrass blended with some other elements that make it well-rounded and fruity - the reviewer who likened it to Froot Loops cereal wasn't too far off base! Add a sizzling lemony-herbal top note to Froot Loops and you have this bomb's scent.

Since lemongrass oil is good for uplifting the spirits, this is a great bomb for those tired or grumpy days we all have sometimes.

There is the mildest shimmer to it, that you really have to look for in the water itself, and it gives the lime-green water a lovely depth and sparkle. But it isn't glittery and you won't end up with anything you can see on your skin. It is more an in-bath pony trick!

This is a great bomb for cheering you up on a wintry day, and one I keep a small supply of and use often

     As we've heard, it's not easy being green.  It's more than easy, it's delightful if you're an Avobath Bath Ballistic.  Infused with avocado (hence the name) and olive oil it moisturizes skin.

     The fragrance is fresh,  rather citrusy, thanks to lemongrass and rosewood.  Bath water is a lovely shade of green, rather like new spring grass.

      If there's glitter in it I didn't find any, which was as I wished.  It's suggested for morning - I'd relax with an Avobath any time of day

I love the fresh scent of the Avobath, there's just nothing like it. It smells like springtime to me. I have yet to notice any glitter in an Avobath bath (and I've taken about 10) so if you're glitter shy, don't let that stop you from trying this one

I like to eat avocados, I like avocado face masks, and now I can bathe in eau de avocado!  This bath bomb is possibly my favorite - very softening, great color (turns your tub into a nice green lagoon), and great lemony scent.  I didn't find the glitter to be very noticeable, so don't worry about that.  Stock up on this one

O.k,these glosses are just plain yummy!

Actually,they don't taste like lipglosses at all,which is a good thing.No one wants waxy or 
chemical flavored gloss that 
makes you want to throw up,right?

All the flavors are amazingly delicious.Each one tastes just like sweets.

The colors are sheer and radiant without looking cheap or tacky.

They go with any eyeshadow or blush color and make your lips sparkle.

I wish the  tubes were just a bit bigger and the glosses were less sticky.

Overall,nice glosses but a bit overpriced for such lil tubes

I am absolutely addicted to this lip gloss. I own over 300 different brands of gloss, and this is by far one of my favorites. It's a pretty good deal, at only $28 for so many colors. I like the small size because it easily fits into any evening bag or pocket. It's fun to layer the different colors as well, and there are an infinate amount of combonations between all of the different colors and flavors. They also taste amazing, each embodying a yummy taste exactly like sugar. It goes especially well with the Aquolina Pink Sugar fragrance, for a sugar-themed cosmetic experience

Was using philosophy's various light scents, discovered this Burberry London sample in my last Sephora shipment. Went to Macy's and bought the set for under $77-lotion, shower gel and 3.3 oz fragrance. Fretted over price until I actually used the products-layering them. Recieved SO many compliments! Not "an old lady's perfume"- not strong nor weak- it has an elegant floral fragrance. 
top notes: rose, clementine and honeysuckle.
heart notes: tiare flower, jasmine and peony.
dry down notes: sandalwood, veil of musk and patchouli. All my favorites

I've tried several shampoo bars and had finally given up hope that I could ever use them - they had always left my hair feeling gross and gummy - no matter how much I rinsed or tried vinegar/water mix rinses after (as was suggested).
But - this one had had some good reviews so I gave it a go. It was awesome! It lathered rather well, and rinsed out very easily. I used it in conjunction with the american cream conditioner - and my hair's very very silky and soft right now. (it had gotten very course over the period of a week with using avalon organics shampoo and conditioner)
I'm excited - now that I've finally found a shampoo bar that works, I can finally say goodbye to bulky shampoo bottles and same some space

Reincarnate can be a hard shampoo to get used to, especially if you're not already using LUSH products. It doesn't 'sud up' much, and feels a little bit muddy and grainy. Don't fret though! It will certainly clean your hair, and will also leave it smelling like wonderful spices (almost as good as "Arabian Bright"). The highlights are not something that come with one or two washings, but with many many washings, and they are /very/ subtle but there. The only reason I don't give this product five stars is that it was not as conditioning as it states it is, and I needed to use another conditioning product with it

I bought these with the also great socks and was completely pleased by the way they left my hands, hydrated and soft. After leaving them on for half an hour with the Glamour Gloves Gel my hands felt reborn. I couldn't get over how the moisturizers had penetrated. I've had these for a couple years and was almost sure they would stop working but they're still doing the job. I've recently seen less expensive gloves on the market and don't know how well they work but these are very high quality

I first caught a waft of this fragrance in a magazine as a tester. I fell in love with the sweet, sugary light smell of it and so did my husband. It's perfect for all seasons since it's light and it definitely makes people ask you what you're wearing. I've been told it smells everything from edible to kissably sweet. Now I want to try some of their other fragrances. If they are half as good as this, they win in my book

I have been using this product for about 3 months.  It is great!  Not only have I noticed a difference, but I get comments from people all the time about how refreshed I look.  I had a baby about 5 months ago and decided that I need to pamper myself a little.  I came across this product in January and was very cautious about purchasing another eye cream.  Nothing has worked in the past.  However, I decided to give it a try.  I noticed changes after a couple of weeks, but wasn't sure if it was just me wanting it to work or it actually working.  Well, now after 3 months, I can totally tell the difference.  I look so much better even without makeup.  I don't even need to put concealor under my eyes any more!!!  Plus, I receive so many great comments from people.

Thank you Hylexin.  Finally something that worked for me

This is the first bronzer I actually finished. This gives the most natural finish and blends really well. I like that it's matte because I'm not a fan of sparkly bronzer. Ever since I started using this, I'm just addicted and can't live without it. It gives the skin a really natural, healthy-looking flush.

I've got medium/olive skin and I use "Light". My skin doesn't look orangey or dirty. Try it and I'm sure you'll like it. Make sure you use a really good brush.

I love this fragrance!  It reminds me of some of the most beautiful and fragrant flowers of Hawaii.  If you've ever visited The Islands and smelled a pikake lei or walked past luscious jasmine bushes, and thought to yourself, "What is that heavenly smell?"  THIS IS IT!  There is not a scent out there on the market that evokes such memories and enjoyment as Kai.  My only concern about this fragrance line is the $cost$, but how I feel and think when I am wearing it makes it all worth it

While most sunscreens these days protect against sunburn, did you know that very few of them actually protect against photodamage? Only two sunscreen ingredients protect against the long UVAI rays that cause photodamage (brown spots, wrinkles, etc); zinc oxide and Parsol 1789. Zinc Oxide protects a broader range of these rays than does Parsol 1789. 

This Skinceuticals sunscreen has zinc oxide and it goes on without any white film or greasiness-perfect for daily use on the face. While Neutrogena Dry Touch suncreens feel more invisible on the skin (you can't even tell it is on except for the smell) and is a good alternative (has Parsol 1789), I still prefer the Skinceuticals for the added protection and virtually no scent whatsoever. Since it's expensive, I tend to use it just on the face and use a cheaper (like Neutrogena) sunscreen on the body when out in the sun.

This foundation provides a flawless finish and natural look, while also giving a good coverage.  I've been using this foundation for years, all year long, and it is one of my favorites.  Not too heavy and not too light, it's the perfect foundation.  

Being Asian American and with a light complexion, finding a good color match had always been a problem unless I spent $40 for a bottle of makeup.  Zhen is one of the best deals around - clean but stylish packaging with a superior product inside

This product is truly amazing!  The application method can be a bit tricky and the performance varies depending on the type of mascara you use, but if you follow the directions and find a good mascara formula then you WILL have long, long lashes.  My lashes are medium length, but when I use this people who know me thing I am wearing falsies.  This stuff rocks!  I've never been able to find a mascara that can do what this does

Is so true of this product.  I have to admit when I first saw the price tag of this product, it was half out of curiousity that I purchased.  I mean could a pair of $20 tweezers be THAT much better than the ole $1.75 or $3 pairs at home?  

Well if your asking yourself that question, YES!  These things have amazing grip and can pull the tinyiest of hairs.  Things that you would have to dig with normal tweezers until you finally rub your skin raw.

Without a doubt, you will get your moneys worth from this product as well as be amazed at their performance.  It's the type of "WOW" that makes you feel like, "How did I ever get along without these before".

Worth every penny and I'll never buy another cheap tweezer again.  These have lasted for years and still retain their fine point.

I had an Amazon reward certificate and was looking for something practical to use it on.  It so happened that I needed new tweezers.  I read the reviews and thought I'd give these a try.  Wow, I can't believe the difference in quality from any other tweezers I have ever owned.  They almost seem to adhere to whatever your are trying to grasp.  It is so easy to precisely and almost painlessly remove even the finest eyebrow hair.  Tweezerman Tweezers ROCK!

I'm sure that you don't need any more assurance, but just to let you know, I've had my tweezerman's for over 5 years now. They are still sharp! Plus if you ever were to drop them, they probably wouldn't be significantly damaged. These tweezers are a must have.

These are great for removing excess oil when you can't stop and wash your face or don't want to disturb your makeup.  I prefer this brand because they unfold to twice their size when you pull them out instead of the size of a half-dollar like the rest of them

I have been wearing ObsessionÂ® by Calvin Klein since it was first launched in 1985, the year I first arrived in California. It seems I am one of those people forever stuck in a time warp and prefer this classic instead of trying new scents. While I prefer the eau de parfum spray I have both variations. Although at first this tends to have a strong aroma, this doesn't last after being applied to your skin. I love the blend of vanilla, mandarin orange, peach and lemon that make up the scent of ObsessionÂ®.

My preference is more of a racy, provocative, alluring scent instead of brimming like flowers. With my skin irritations, asthma and allergies I have no problems with spraying my body parts with ObsessionÂ®. The color is quite appealing, reminding me of Spiced Rum with the brown, amber and gold tones. ObsessionÂ® cologne is suitable for both day and evening wear, indoors and outdoors and those luscious intimate settings. 

This is definitely a feminine scent, sweet, sexy and not too fruity or powerful.   There is a gold toned rim with the cap snapping on and pulling off most of the time with ease. Sometimes the lid does not go on just right and then the cap part becomes undone and this makes two pieces.

Once the scent has set in for awhile on my skin I detect a hint of floral with wood combination and have read on fragrance.net that ObsessionÂ® has oriental spices. It really is a winning combination that has captured my interest over the years. This is a scent that is recognizable by men and women and can be worn through out the seasons. 

I would not say this is a musk scent but more of a spicy tingle that needs to be only administered once a day for long lasting appeal. The appeal of ObsessionÂ® seems to run from girls in their early twenties to those of us in our early forties, from conservative ladies to party animals. 
 
Although it is a darker color than most fragrances, there is no staining on clothing, but I do not wear sweaters, whites or turtlenecks. When I do use the glass jar I have noticed frequently when standing over the sink the yellowish/brown tint left in the sink and have to rinse it off as well as my finger tips. 

ObsessionÂ® is a potent and romantic perfume for evening. The prices of the assorted sizes of ObsessionÂ® range from forty to sixty dollars.

This is by far the best Shampoo and Conditioner set I have used.  I have very fine, very straight, and very long hair that breaks easily but not with this shampoo and conditioner.  This set makes it smooth, but not oily and so when I brush my hair there is no yanking going on.  My hair is noticeably more shiny and soft.  It has a very pleasant scent and it is all natural.  What a great way to pamper yourself!  Definitely worth the extra investment

	Mistral, as many know, is a powerful, gusty wind that blows across the south of France.  Mistral, as I was happy to discover,  is also the name of a line of bath and body products, all French inspired, all lusciously lovely from scented soaps to soothing lotions to rejuvenating body butters.

	Matthew Tilker, founder and president of Mistral,  utilizes Shea butter, which is an efficacious natural healer, in a myriad of must-have forms.  Derived  from the nuts of the African Shea Tree (according to sacred custom the nuts are  harvested primarily by women), this butter  is  highly emollient,  a boon for those with dry skin, chapped lips, any number of skin irritations.

	The pure Shea Butter soap comes in a plethora of inviting fragrances, all milled six times (while others boast being  triple milled).  South Seas is a particular favorite - it's as fresh as an ocean breeze and as calming, soothing as a tropical island.  The marine scent is accented with a touch of grapefruit, white flowers and soft woods.  An irresistible combination.

	South Seas is a fragrance with which you wish to surround yourself - made possible by the shower gel, body lotion, massage bath and body oil, bath salts and candle all available at very accessible prices.

	Highly recommended

The cream is great. It instantly gets absorbed  after application and i believe helps over time close up leakage of blood capilleries (which causes black circle appearences). I suffered from chronic dark circles. This cream after 1 month of application has considerably lightened my dark circles and has reduced puffiness. I would suggest anyone who is looking for an effective cream give this product a shot. considering my condition i still have light dark circles left and hope this cream will continue to benefit me. I still have doubts on this cream totally brightening my skin tone around my eyes, but never the less I find it effective

Through luck of genetics, I have dark circles. I've had them since as far back as I can remember. No amount of sleep, eat well, or generally good lifestyle choices changed my dark circles. 

I was pretty hesitant to try it out, since, woah... $95 is a lot of money, but I gave it a shot. I used it exactly per the instructions.

I was actually pretty discouraged because I didn't see a change, but then BAM, in the 3rd week of using it, I woke up and my circles were soooo much noticably lighter. I could cry. It's hard being so young and having dark circles under your eyes, but now I  look more my age. And I'm still only in the 3rd week, so I have a lot of hope for the product. 

I feel badly for the people who didn't get a reaction, but as they state in their pamphlet, it will not work on 100% of people. Like anything, really, won't work for 100% of people. 

But it worked for me, and I'm so very happy. I would have paid sooo much more for these results.

I love how this product works and feels on my skin!! Does an excellent job off removing makeup and cleaning the skin with out drying your skin out! Makes skin feel cool and clean!!

I have very sensitive skin an was concerned that this product was going to break my skin out OR be very drying because this product tones as well as cleanses the skin. But that  wasn't the case. My skin didn't break out, nor is this product drying. Highly recommend!

I used this relaxer for the first time after using many brand name ones. I was impressed with the results. It leaft my hair with much needed moisture, and very shiny. I normally apply the realxer myself at home, but I choose to go professional to really capture the promises that this product states. The smell was not noticeable, which was good since most chemicals are so harsh and strong. It didn't burn my scalp like most have. The quantity was ample considering that most relaxers are cheap with the amount they give I think that it was worth the price! I'll be buying it again

This is by far the most expensive relaxer I've ever used and it is worth every penny.  I first heard of it as being Oprah's relaxer so I decided to hunt it down.  One of the best things I've ever done.  I have very coarse, thick "horsehair" that usually defeats most over the counter perms after a few washings.  Not Phytospecific's relaxer.  My hair stayed soft AND STRAIGHT no matter what the weather or I did to it. And it's the healthiest it's ever been.  No other relaxer ever did that for my hair.  In fact they usually made it worse! I absolutely love the Phytorelaxer and I am officially addicted.  If it were less pricey, it would get 5 stars

i'm black, have kinky hair, and i've been relaxing my hair for about 25 years. i've used many many types of relaxers to my dismay:- hair falling out, breaking, dry, etc.
so i let my hair "rest" for about 5 years then i tried the relaxer thing again after i found phyto. i've been doing my own hair now for about 1 year, and it's been great!- except for the price. my hair still feels as if it has life in it, it it is not breaking, it is not falling out. it burns like regular straightener. i use vinegar to neutralize it, then use the neutralizing shampoo with indicator to check for pink. please, there's not enough neutralizing shampoo to get rid of the staraightener.
the price is scary, but i'm more afraid of having my hair fall out and having to fix that. 
soon, i'll have to get a hairdresser though, because my hair has now been retaining it's length and growing - and it's harder to straighten it myself.

I'm a big fan of "non-traditional" perfumes - I don't care for sweet floraly scents, and I have been known to poach my man's cologne occassionally, just to enjoy the scent all day. So if you like citrusy/woodsy scents, you MUST try this one - it has an unusual top note and dry-down that are hard to describe, but anyway it never fails to get compliments from men, and the "WHAT are you wearing?" from women.  

It's intense, but it's not overpowering the way some Orientals can be.  But it's also summery-light.  I can't explain it - just try it.  A couple of times.  And for something even more unusual, try Jardin Mediterrenne (sp?) also by Hermes - the only perfume I've ever given 5 stars

I *love* this formula for my thick, naturally curly, slightly hilighted hair.  It does a great job cleaning without stripping, and this is the first conditioner that did a good job tackling my naturally curly hair without weighing it down.  I did get a good deal at my salon - $9 for the shampoo and a little more for the conditioner

To tell you the truth, I have tried everything on my hair to take away the frizz.  Nothing really worked at all...but Biosilk is a miracle!  The first time  I tried it, I noticed a major difference in my hair.  Just add a little bit to your hair, and it will immediately smooth it out, adding shine and softness.  It will also not weigh your hair down or make it too greasy..just don't use that much of it.  I mostly use this with my flat-iron, and I get amazing results.  I happen to like the smell of it...it reminds me of being in a salon!  Try the shampoo and conditioner as well

I have wavy and coarse hair and I have a whole lot of it. I use this product after shower on damp hair and then blow-dry. This product really works and makes my hair soft and silky and it gives the hair nice movement and makes it easy to style. My hairdresser who has similiar hair as mine recommended me this product and she said she loves it. I am very happy to find this product before wasting a lot of money on trying others that don't work. It is a bliss

My hair stylist first introduced me to this product a few years ago and I've used it ever since. It makes your hair really soft and shiny and even smells good. Just a little of biosilk goes a long way. Gets rid of the frizz and dryness and really improves the look and feel of your hair. I definitely reccomend it

I was hooked on Sebastian's shine serum forever.  Then I switched to this after hearing all the rave reviews.  It makes it just as shiny as the Sebastian, but for my thick wavy hair, it is easier to apply.  I only need about a quarter size amount, way less than any other product.  It has a nice soft finish.  
So if you like Sebastian and Redkin's shine serums, you'll like this.  
I'm not going to go as far as to say it's a miracle worker.  It makes your hair shinier.  It helps a little with my frizz, but doesn't depouf.

I have straight hair, but it is super-long and thick, past my waist, so I have problems combing it and keeping it smooth.  Biosilk is the best stuff I have found to detangle after washing, and keep my hair soft after it is dry.  I have tried everything else, and I mean everything, and nothing compares.  I'm so hooked I have bought it by the gallon, and believe me, that is not cheap!  It even smells great, it's not greasy, and it is fantastic for giving or receiving massages, too

This is truly one of the best hand and nail creams out there.  It is quickly absorbed and not at all greasy - I put some on before I walk out the door in the morning and again before bedtime and it has made a real difference in the softness of my hands and the health of my cuticles.  Hangnails have always been a problem for me but this product keeps them under control as long as I apply it regularly. Love it!

I really like this mascara. I only gave it 4 because it is clumpy and I have to spend a little time with my eyelash comb getting the clumps out.  Otherwise, it is the only mascara that doesn't cause me to loose a ton of lashes.  Everything else from Estee Lauder, Bourjois to Great Lash causes me loose a lot of lashes.  I also like that if I cry, I don't wind up looking like a raccoon, it subtly melts away; no mess! It washes off easily with soap and water and is flexible, not flaky.

I have been using mascara since I was a teenager and this is absolutely the best ever. Ocassionally I have read reviews about other 'fantastic' mascaras and strayed and tried them, only to be disappointed. Now I wouldn't even bother trying anything else even when given in free gift packs. I have very long fair eyelashes and use black. The brush is easy to guide and you do not end up with big thick, clumpy patches especially when the mascara is new. It parts and separates the lashes perfectly. For night I apply 2 coats for a more dramatic look. It never smudges and is easy to remove (I use Clinique 'naturally gentle eye make-up remover'). And yes, it may be a little expensive but it lasts for ages (doesn't dry out like other mascaras)and the quality of the product surpasses anything else. Also my eyes tend to be a little sensitive and I have never had any problems even when accidentally getting the mascara in my eye. Try it, you won't be disappointed

Follow the cleanser with the Komenuka Bijin Skin Lotion and you may wonder why you are suddenly catching the scent of SAKE. In fact, this cleansing toner does contain SAKE along with Rice Bran, Seaweed, Aloe, Yeast, Glycyrrhizate, Orange, Lemon, Matricaria, Algae, Luffa Cylindrica and Fountain Water.

The toner completes the process of removing impurities and also has the added benefit of contracting the pores so they look smaller. Men may also enjoy this as an aftershave lotion.

This salve is just perfect under Bliss's Softening socks. It's amazing how much you can smear on, leave on with the socks for at least half an hour and have all those great softening agents completely absorbed when you take off the socks. It leaves feet renewed. Use it once or twice a week to tame tough tootsies

I received this razor as a birthday gift from my brother a couple of weeks ago. I thought, "Hmmm...Handsome looking vintage piece, but there's no way in hell I'm gonna put that meat cleaver to my face!" Well guilt got the best of me, I figured the razor looked expensive so I'll give it a go and hope that if I die from blood loss the police will figure out that my death was from shaving with a new razor and it's not from suicide. I'll tell you after a few times shaving with this razor I am now going to retire My Gillette Fuzion. It's takes a bit longer to shave with this razor than with a conventional multi-blade but the results are undeniably better. My wife can't wait to kiss my cheek with school girl glee right after I shave! I have a beard that is as tough as sandpaper and I've never had a closer shave than with this Merkur. I don't have the same spots to go over and over again and therefore my face is less irritated. I use a brush, a glycerin based shave cream and always shave in the shower and that makes a significant difference as well. Factor in that blades for this razor costs so much less then Mach 3 &amp; Fuzion's (I buy cryogenically tempered blades that last 2x longer than store bought) and the way to opt out from expensive razor marketing ploys becomes clear. Don't sit on the fence on this one ditch whatever Mach, to the nth power, razor you're using and pick this Merkur ASAP

This razor rocks... the proper technique is easy to learn: short, light strokes, down, then up (if you want a closer shave). This gives me hardly any nicks compared to the Gillette Mach 3 and is way easier to unclog than the Shick Quattro. 

The sample blade continues to last with about 2 shaves a week since Dec. 2006. Typical razor cartridges wouldn't even come close to that longevity, and they cost about 4 times as much as the replacement Merkur blades, which are 50 cents each.

I am just doing facial shaving with it at this point; hopefully it will fare just as well with head shaving. I expect I'll be using Merkur for the rest of my life

My very first DE razor after many recommendations, and I must say that I am yet another one of those enthusiastic supporters of the Merkur HD DE Safety Razor.  I may eventually decide to upgrade, but if I ever do, it will only be after much practice with this razor and simply for the sake of having the adjustment feature, which may or may not be necessary for some individuals depending on the toughness and thickness of your beard.  When used in conjunction with a badger hair shaving brush, some excellent shaving cream (Proraso was my first, and the only thing mildly unpleasant is the scent, and even that grows on you after a while...check your local Target near the women's spa section) and the highest quality DE razor blade, changed every so often, of course, this razor provides an excellent, close, irritation-free shave.  After using this marvel, I vow never to return to the cheaply made, ridiculously expensive (when the cost of replacement cartridges is considered over the course of a man's shaving lifetime) multi-blade systems of Gillette or Schick.  Just be a little more careful of your technique, and getting an outstanding shave from this razor should be a cinch.  Highly recommended

I'm a first time DE shaver and this razor is great.  My grandfather used these types of razors, and it feels wonderful to be able to enjoy shaving rather than scraping my face with a Mach III.

Only advice is, try a couple different blades.  Depending on your skin type/beard you'll need a different type of blade.  One blade doesn't fit all.   And always remember, this isn't the Mach III, don't apply pressure

This razor returns one to an Augustinian sense of progress and history.  It is similar to what my grandfather used to shave with, and is simply the best way to shave, so long as you have a decent brush and soap at hand

I have very fine, poker straight hair that is not dry or oily.  Then I got this conditioner and BIG shampoo and my hair regained it's shine, but more importantly -- I got bounce!  I never had any waves or body in my hair before but this conditioner did it.

I have used the BIG shampoo with other conditioners and it was not as good for me.  I like Big shampoo, but this VEGANESE conditioner is the real key to my newly bouncy hair.  VEGANESE just works perfectly for me and my hair has never looked better.

One thing -- I kind of hate the smell and I do not think it is lemony at all.  It smells...I don't know, too much like an "granola girl" or something -- almost patchouli-like to me.  HOWEVER it leaves my hair looking super, so really, who cares if it smells good in the shower

This conditioner leaves hair ultra-soft and doesn't weigh it down. If you have trouble with conditioners leaving a strong residue on your hair, this one won't.

The ingredients contain rosemary infusion, lavender flower infusion, seaweed and fresh lemon juice. The lemon is great for washing the hair clean of residue. It's a great conditioner

If your hair alternates between various moods every day of the week, then a good supply of conditioners and shampoos should keep you happy all year long. The lemon oil in two of the Lush products work together especially well. Veganese Conditioner and I Love Juicy shampoo could not be a better solution if you need to deep clean your hair. Like after you have put too much hairspray in your hair or you went swimming or say you fell in a mud puddle (In that case, also reach for Happy Hippy body wash). 

You just never know what may occur and one must always be prepared. The Veganese is also a lovely vegetarian product that can be enjoyed by anyone. It has a very clean, happy energy and a lemony scent. The slippery conditioner slicks across your hair, making it shiny and manageable without weighing it down.

This also contains rosemary infusion, lavender flower infusion, seaweed and fresh lemon juice. Will be appreciated by anyone trying to lighten their hair. 

If you use the henna products by Lush, these two products might slightly lighten your henna results. This could be desired or you may want to go back to using Rehab and American Cream if you want to keep a deeper henna shade.

If you want to feel light and breezy, this conditioner won't weigh you down. My hair feels fluffy and deliciously light and bouncy. I have this strange urge to go wander in lemon orchards, run through mud puddles and pick flowers by the side of the road. 

Now officially in the mood to make lemonade!

I used Veganese for quite awhile, quite happily.  As there is no artificial fragrance, or strong natural fragrance oils in the product, it has a ho-hum scent.  This actaully was a nice break from all the overwhelmingly perfumed hair products on the market.  I felt Veganese adequately conditioned my hair, did not irritate my scalp.  I liked that it had no animal products and is not tested on animals.  Those who try to avoid chemicals may not like sodium lauryl sulfate in this product

I purchased this pumice stone to help remove the dried skin on my feet and ankles that appears as you get older.  It does a good job and comes in its own small case.  I use it frequently and find that I have much less dry skin in that area now

You use the peel kit by mixing a clear gel capsule with water and smear that onto your face.You then  put some cream on top of the gel on your face which mixes together creating a shaving cream beard. After using the creams you then scrape it off using a tongue depressor look alike to shave off the foam. After a quick rinse my skin looked less dull,  and helped clear  blotches.4 stars because I ran out of the cream, and still have some unused gel capsules

I really like this peel.  It is very easy to use and I have noticed a difference in my skin.  It is clearer and the redness and discoloration is fading.  I even noticed my clogged pores are diminishing.  I recommend this peel to anyone.  I have very sensitive skin and it did not cause irritation.  I use this one about twice a week.

I also recommend the microdelivery vitamin C peel.  That one I use once a week.

Calling this a peel doesnt seem quite right. When I think of the word peel I imagine the old gel type peels that you would let dry on your face and then take off like a mask. Or I think of something that is harsh or abrasive. While this works like a peel it is gentle and goes far beyond what you would expect a facial product to do.

You need this product if you
- your skin is prone to break out and is very congested  
- your skin is sun damaged  
- your skin is aging rapidly  
- you enjoy in-office medical peels 
- you have a big event coming up and want your skin to look great  
- you want to maximize penetration of your treatment products 
- you want baby soft skin 


Also if you smoke! I first tried this years ago when I was a smoker and it made such a difference in the texture and clarity of my skin. 

This is a truly amazing product and completely different and unique to anything else on the market. Try it and you'll see.

This product also lasts a surprisingly long time. You only use half a capsule for each treatment which gives you several months of usage out of it

I wanted to try a new lipgloss because all of the colored ones that I have are horrificly sticky and if they aren't sticky they do not stay on for long.  This one however, manages to combine my love for lipgloss with all the needs of a chapstick.  The color (apple a day) was intimidating looking in the tube but looks perfectly on and doesn't go anywhere.  It also has NO STICKYNESS!  YAY!  I love this gloss and is the perfect gloss for all of my needs!

The first time I smelled this intoxicating scent I knew I had to have it for myself.  It's heady, rich, very exotic, dark and mysterious....when I wear this perfume, I envision a room filled with beautiful brown skinned women with dark black hair and richly colored silks of red and purple covering their bodies laying around on organza and brocade covered chaises eating sweet dark fruit and sipping red wine from cobalt glasses

Though I have never traveled the world, this perfume allows
me to feel like a veteran globe trotter It is sophisticated
without being obnoxious. I genuinely feel like a woman of
intrigue and experience. Though fanciful, it is fun for a
homegrown rose.

Caleche is an absolute classic.  I'm often stopped and asked what I'm wearing.  Pretty much everything at the department stores smells the same (LIKE CHEMICALS).  Caleche is the real thing and the Soie de Parfum lasts. Make sure when purchasing that you don't accidentally buy Caleche Eau Delicate...it's a completely different frangrance, guaranteed to make you gag.  Why do marketers keep coming up with subtle twists to existing fragrances (Miracle, Happy, Pleasures, Poison)?  Once you try Caleche, you'll no longer look for anything else; I highly recommend the lotion and shower gel, too

lipstick going. This review is for the Guava Stain shade. I first bought this lipstick, I believe in the mid to late eighties. I was delighted with it then and am now. It is sheer, light, non greasy and the color never changes. The color is NOT neutral, but I find that I can wear it with almost any color of clothing except primarily pink or red outfits. Over the years it has become just about the only lipstick shade I wear. I would buy different brands,different shades and wear them maybe once then back to Guava Stain. It along with Clinque's soft pressed blush in New Clover, orginally bought about the same time as the lipstick have become my favorites, and the one's I reach for time and again. They are my dependables. Daytime wear for sure, not night, this is a subtle sheer color

i love get fresh products, especially the lemongrass lavendar scent. i use the hand sugar scrub (which is very moisturizing and gets rid of cooking odors on hands). it is very light and pleasant, as are the others. i love the look better naked kit and the relief for tattered tootsies kit. i am a beauty junkie and i have used much more expensive products but i never seem to like them as much as these. great gift- the hatbox design is very cute

I have always carried a soft spot in my hear for shiny metallic eye shadows and metallic browns, chocolates, coppers and vanilla such as in this quad for look fantastic on pretty much any complexion. Each prismatic color cube is in it's own tiny little clear box with a tiny lid on, those I discard and simply keep the top four squares open unless I out the entire top lid on once I'm done doing my makeup.

I love to sweep the palest shimmery vanilla on the entire brow bone and my whole lid, I usually wear black liquid liner right under the lash line and right on top, creating a black back drop that make applying any eye makeup on top easy and gives it great depth. Then I use the darkest color with a short brush I cut on an angle to blend the dark color on top of the liner for a smoky and glowing effect. The other two colors I layer on top in between the vanilla base and the dark smoke, but I don't feel the need to use all four colors at the same time. I also wet the brush sometimes, Visine is good for making liquid liner type of a finish when used on a brush and then dipped in some shadow.

The colors have deep intensity to them and they sparkle like melting precious metals in the sun. Wonderful for any makeup novice or artist for their ease of use and the dramatic and breath taking effect they so easily produce.

I've never smelled anything like this.  If you've ever been to the Mediterranean coast, you will be instantly transported by this scent.  It goes on strong, lasts long, and dries down to a wonderfully woodsy-citrusy finish that definitely has a bit of ocean air - but not the "Yankee Candle Ocean Water" type scent... this is the real thing, like an aromatherapy treatment you can take with you!  Rejoice, all women who are tired of sugary-syrupy womens' perfume!  This is it

This fragrance takes you on holiday to a place you may never have been.  It is a warm environment, smelling of salt water and warm skin. There is a tang in the air of citrus, maybe grapefruit.  This blend is absolutely delicious, inspring a hunger for more. I simply can't get enough of Un Jardin en Mediterranee. 

The Eau de Toilette is very light and subtle.  Fresh but not girly. Tangy, not sweet. This fragrance is for women who understand the allure of salt and warm skin. 


I purchased this fragrance 3 weeks ago and have worn nothing else since; it will remain one of the four or five fragrances I wear.  I look forward to when the line expands to include body cremes or lotions, or bath products

Proraso Shave Cream is the best bang for the buck in hi-end, non drugstore shave creams.  I've tried them all and keep coming back to proraso.  The texture, consistency and effectiveness of the cream are first rate - and you don't need a badger hair brush! I initially missed using a brush at first, but don't miss all the product I wasted that were left behind in the bristles.  Couple proraso with a good safety razor (may I suggest Merkur) and you'll get a shave that trounces anything a Mach III can throw at you. Trust me

I typically don't wear much cologne or perfume but this one is a winner! My husband bought this one for me for Christmas, I'd never even seen it before but he liked how it smelled.  What a great guy! I couldn't have been happier with this gift. I love this scent...clean and fresh...you can wear this scent day or night, not heavy or overwhelming.  The unique beauty of the bottle is wonderful too.  Highly recommend Beyond Paradise

This lip gloss is super!!!  Not only does it glide on your lips, it has staying power.  The colors are so subtle and pretty.  It is worth every penney and I will not waste my money on cheaper, sticky and short-lived lip glosses

I bought the Laura Mercier Kit: Mini Glaces with six glaces including: champagne glace, rose glace, bare beige glace, ambre rose glace, petal glace and violet glace. 

My favorite was Rose, but all of the colors are very beautiful. I also have a full size of Melon, another of my favorites. While the colors are beautiful, provide lots of shine and are long wearing, they are very sticky. MAC Lip Glass is much stickier, so if you don't mind that, they might be right for you. Also, the good thing about the kit is that you get to try lots of different colors, but the tubes are quite small, with a steep price. So, if you are willing to put up with a sticky gloss and a high price tag in exchange for some of the most beautiful colors, this might be the right gloss for you.

        Lips need a little shimmer in the summer, which is why I'm a fan of  Laura Mercier's Lip Glaces.  While they do come in 14 luscious shades, my two current faves are "Cancun Coral" and "Miami Pink."  The "Cancun Coral" is a soft coral which I like for day wear, and the "Miami Pink" has all the sparkle and pizzazz of hot pink - perfect for evening (especially with Mercier's Pressed Powder Bronzer).

	All the shades are abundantly blessed with Vitamin E, Lanolin and Mineral Oil to soften and smooth lips.  These glaces aren't at all heavy or sticky - they're light, go on easily, evenly, and don't bleed over lip lines if you take a bite of something good.

	Glaces can be worn alone or over lip color if you want to give added gleam to a favorite lipstick

All right for starters, i always have thought curve to be a very cheep crappy cologne. But i had never smelled it, i had always hurd it from friends and family that it sucked. Well the other day i was at work and some girl that has always liked me gave me two samples of curve. I tried them out and loved the origanal curve the smell is sweet but still masculine, girls love it, all the time girls say, you smell really good and ask what i'm wereing, and i always say " that smell is all me baby" But really i have curve to thank for all the action i've been getting, you have to try it out for your self.     I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I've generally been a one-cologne guy -- I had settled into using Acqua di Gio for a number of years, after having used Nautica for a number of years as well. When she got pregnant several months ago, my wife confessed to me that she really didn't like Acqua di Gio (this after two years! Pregnancy does heighten sensitivity to smell, though). 

I still had some Nautica around, plus the original and no-longer-made Zegna scent from Spain, so I used those for a while. I then bought the newest Zegna cologne, "Z", after my wife smelled it and found it unobjectionable.  

Well, no sooner had I bought the Z then my wife found a scratch and sniff of Curve in some magazine and said that I really should be using that. The next day we happened to be at K-Mart -- K-MART!!! -- for some household odds and ends, and my wife came across a display of Curve. She insisted on buying it for me. 

Ever since then, my wife goes nuts when I use it. I don't use it during the week, really -- I'm a somewhat older guy, and it has a sweetish overtone to it that's not very serious -- but whenever I do, my wife always tells me how absolutely wonderful I smell, indeed, how DELICIOUS I smell. Today was casual Friday at work, so I figured, okay. I leave for work very early, before my wife is awake. Sure enough, she calls me at work this morning -- "you used Curve today, didn't you? I can tell because the bathroom smells wonderful!"

Every woman I know who has commented on it loves it on guys. So it's less expensive and available at K-Mart. And yes it is a little bit sweeter than most colognes I'm personally used to. But it does have a pleasant smell, and if the women love it, well . . .

I have an oily T-zone, or I should say "had".  I started using this product because I was breaking out a lot due to the extra oil my skin was producing to keep my face moisturized.  Not only has my face cleared up, but it has a nice healthy shine to it all day.  No makeup necessary.

It is definitely a great moisturizer.  If you're looking for something that is thick but NOT greasy and won't make you look like you're frying an egg on your forehead, this is definitely it!  The texture also makes it easy to apply makeup on afterwards.  I use it everyday in the morning time after I wash my face.  The only thing to be careful is, if you have EXTREMELY dry and parched skin and are exfoliating daily to the point where your skin is aching, then try to stay away from this moisturizer until your skin heals.  I was overdosing my skin with benzoyl peroxide, AHA acids, and retinol a few months ago, leaving my skin extremely sensitive.  When I put on this gel, it would make my skin burn.  But other than that, you're safe using it on a daily regular normal routine

I have been using this starter kit for almost a month and I am beginning to see results. My experience with this product has been that my skin definitely got worse before it got better. For the first few weeks, my skin seemed to explode with more acne than usual... however, last week it started to clear up rapidly. I'm still having blemishes pop up daily, but they disappear within a few days, and overall my skin is much smoother and my (many, many) scars are less visible. I have struggled with moderate to severe acne for 6 years and have tried more products and treatments than I care to remember, and decided to try Murad after it was suggested to me (I'd never heard of it before). It certainly is no "miracle" product where you see results instantly (especially if you have a moderate to severe acne problem), but I just re-ordered the starter kit and am hoping the results will continue to improve. This product is definitely worth a shot

Murad promises the miracle cure for acne. While the product is good, it's not a miracle. I've been usines Murad for two months and while my skin has improved, it's not flawless. I still get break outs and they still take a while to heal. I'll keep using it because it's a skin routine as good as any other and who knows, maybe my skin will improve

I'm an admitted soap snob so I've probably tried just about every soap there is. Mistral soap is right up there with the best.
First of all I have to mention the customer service. I had bought another brand of soap that came in a very pleasing scent combo that Mistral didn't offer. I emailed Mistral's customer service asking them to consider making it. I got a reply right away and after a few email exchanges was told they would see what could be done. I like that--being responsive to the customer.
 What do I like about the soap? For one thing, the size. It's huge at 7 oz. I also like the scents offered: Very pleasing combinations that stay on the skin in a subtle way once you rinse and dry. Best of all is how it lathers up on the skin and once rinsed off leaves no residue. It does leave the skin soft.

Naturally, with a name like Buffy, I would have tried this.  Whether I like it or not I get these on a regular basis from friends and family who see my name splattered all over it.  Lucky for me, I like.  

Ever heard the expression 'soft as a baby's butt'?  Erm, no? 

Easy.  Simple to use, obviously.  No messing with jars or bottles.  Just go to town massaging those pesky areas - I'm convinced it works wonders on orange peel skin, and cannot be persuaded otherwise.

I have some dry bumpy bits at the top of my arms that have been resistant to any scrubby product I've ever tried to use, but buffy got my skin so smooth! Amazing, and highly recommended. Soak in the tub/shower/whatever so the hot water softens up your skin, then scrub away. The small bar lasts 2 or 3 uses; the large is twice as big. The small one is more reasonably priced for people who just want to sample the stuff.

This thing has lots of great little scrubby bits in it. Ground rice, ground almonds, AND adzuku beans. Not just one, but three, and they are all super-scrubby. You'll be a little red when you're done, but it's SO worth it once you've cooled off and your skin is as smooth as a baby's bottom.

The only downside is that it makes your tub look like somebody dumped sand into the bottom of it once the thing drains. The bar melts at around 'hot water' temperature, and you're not supposed to use any moisturizer after using this stuff - but you really don't have to! The moisturizing oils in the bar really do work very well. I'll definitely be picking up a couple more of these.

The cocoa butter/lemon/lavendar scent is really amazing as well. Soothing AND refreshing, it can wake you up in the morning or calm you down at night before you go to sleep. Definitely try this thing, though, if you're looking for ultimate exfoliation plus moisturizing

I am 40 and fell in love with this scent right away.  The nice thing is you don't need to douse yourself with it to get the effect.  My mother,who is 75, never mentions my perfume, noticed it right away and kept asking me about it.  I just ordered her some for her birthday

I am in my mid 30's.  I am not a Britney fan at all.  I received a department store sales flyer in the mail a few days ago and it had a sample of Fantasy in it.  Out of curiosity, I opened it and could not believe I liked the scent.  My husband and I are both picky about perfume.  I decided to order a sample size off of Ebay before buying the full monty - because the last perfume we both really liked was Sensi - but it made my husband sick after a bit.  Well, I got it yesterday and I still really like it.  I am shocked the sweetness that it starts with does not give me a headache.  I think I will buy a full sized bottle once my sample is gone

I just got this perfume for Valentine's Day.  I love it!  Yes, it is sweet smelling, as another reviewer mentions, but it's a pleasant sweetness.  Cotton candy does describe it, actually.  But who says grownups don't like smelling yummy??  There's a hint of vanilla as well and overall, I think the combo is fantastic!

I love Curious, and now I love Fantasy, too!  They are two very different perfumes, so it's easy to understand why a person can like one and not the other.  I will say, though, that Fantasy lasts far longer than Curious.  You can apply it in the morning and still smell it when you go to sleep!  Which, I don't mind at all...

I recommend this, of course, but I recommend you sample it before you buy.  Just because you liked Curious doesn't mean you will like this one

This is a minty fresh soap that keeps its fragrance by being topped with a black wax layer (hence Demon in the Dark.) Before you put this in the shower, cut off the wax. Then enjoy the tingling soap. Very invigorating

I purchsed this product for my husband and he hates beauty products. When we got it the minty scent was soooo strong in the box. When we opened the box it was like a minty apple juice drink. He used it and I was all over him and the minty smell gave him just the right energy to "bring it"

I have been struggling with dry skin and mild acne for years. Recently, I revamped my cleansing routine and my makeup. I bought the Philosphy Purity cleanser and Hope in a Jar. It has made an unbelievable difference in my skin! My skin is smooth, not a dry flake anywhere. It is as soft as a baby's butt.

It is worth noting that a little goes a LONG way. You only need a very small amount (about the size of a dime or less) for your whole face. It is a very light texture, almost like a mousse, and glides over your skin and absorbs quickly. If you use too much (I did the first few times)then your face could look greasy. If you remember that less is more, then you will get a perfectly moisturized, yet matte, complexion.

After using the Philosophy cleanser and Hope in a Jar, I use the Bare Escentuals mineral makeup (bought the Light/Fairly Light starter kit). My skin, for the first time ever, is flawless. No acne. No dry skin. No reddish areas. Just a perfectly smooth complexion. I keep looking in the mirror, thinking "Is this my skin? Really?" I cannot believe what a difference this product (and the mineral makeup) has made. 

I have heard of others being allergic to some ingredients in the Hope in a Jar, so it is not for everyone. I suggest getting a sample size to make sure you won't have a reaction

First of all let me preface this by stating that I literally just put this product on minutes ago. I have had a chemical peel over a week ago and was given Retin A and therefore my face was peeling so horribly, that I thought I couldn't leave the house. I mean my makeup would literally come right off. I was horrified! I tried several moisterizers sometimes multiple ones but could still see the skin flaking off onto my desk, so I researched this and went to Sephora and bought a kit. I washed my face, did the serum and added this product and I honestly do not see 1 single flake of dry skin, it does tingle but I think it's because my face is raw and so dry but it feels as if my skin is drinking it up like a cold glass of water. I am anxious to see what happens in the weeks to come. I have mild cyctic acne and have struggled with it for years. I decided to see a dermatolist and then got chemical peels it helped to rid me of the bad acne but then I was so dry for 2 wks I couldn't bare to even look at myself. My skin doesn't hurt anymore, for allthe sensitive people, there is a sensitve version but if you have dry skin from the crazy acne treatments they make us do or peels or just dry winter heat, this is the product for you. If it seems strong then use it every other night until you skin can adapt. Or just once a day. I hope you find this product helpful like I did becaus I am still looking in the mirrow that's at my desk

Fahrenheit by Dior has a fragrance like no other... I've been fascinated by this fragrance ever since I can remember.

It is bold and fragrant... generally people seem to either like it a lot or hate it. It seems a little overpowering at first but as I said, you either like it or hate it.

the fragrance is masculine no doubt and it's not something that I'd use in summer... essentially a night fragrance.

Lancome's Juicy Tubes in Simmer tastes like my beverage of choice, Orange Julius.  When you apply it, it feels like you're rubbing the tip of an orange creamsicle ice cream pop onto your lips (minus the cold, minus the cream).  The color is a very subtle pink-ish beige, but it provides enough glossy shimmer to keep your lips a-simmer!  This is my 4th tube of juicy (also a big fan of Spring Fling &amp; Berry Bold) and so far this is my favorite flavor

I used to use Mac's Glass lipgloss before Juicy Tubes were around. Any time the wind blew I had hair stuck to the incredibly sticky gloss which, as you know, is extremely unpleasant and annoying. Juicy tubes stays on, but doesn't have the overly-sticky feeling which is wonderful.

I don't wear much makeup and find Juicy Tubes to add that "something special" to a dewy face. I recommend Daiquiri or Berry Bold for the most natural looks. Daiquiri is more of a straightforward shine while Berry Bold gives you that red lipped childlike look we all used to have naturally. You will adore this gloss. I can't live without it

Oh my gosh!  I love this lip gloss so much.  I first bought one last year, and it was the best item of makeup I've ever bought!  It goes great over other lip gloss/lipstick or alone.  All of the colors are great, but I'd start our with pink first.  My personal favorite is "Spring Fling" because it's not so bright, but it's still juicy.  You will deffinetly not regret buying one of these.  It's worth every penny

My boyfriend has this cologne and I love it!  It smells so good.  Even if he is wearing the deodorant and not the cologne, it smells as if he was.  It may be a little on the expensive side (not as expensive on amazon.com as Macy's or other department stores), but it's well worth it.  Just be sure to correctly select the item you want because the picture shown is of the cologne

I love this stuff!! Five months ago I was diagnosed with having AK's (Actinic Keratosis -- lesions that can develop into squamous cell carcinoma/ skin cancer). My dermatologist recommended I use Skinceuticals CE Ferulic every day as it prevents thymine dimers (DNA mutations associated with skin cancer) with a medium exfoliator for a few months before taking more drastic measures to eradicate the AK's. My skin has never been healthier!! The lesions (which were scaly, itchy, and red) are healed and the overall apperance of my skin has improved dramatically and is much more even. My pores are smaller and I have a healthy glow. The CE Ferulic also is packed with antioxidant protection to help fight free-radical damage and provides photoprotection. 
HIGHLY recommended for those with AK's, uneven skin tone, large pores, or blemished or dull skin. 
LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!

After hearing so many good things about Philosophy's Cinnamon Buns, I just had to try it out for myself. I found it to not really smell like cinnamon buns, but more like water mixed with sugar. If you use it on your head, it will leave a lingering smell, but it won't last long on your body after taking a shower. I think this product is a nice way of treating yourself, but I definitely do not think it smells like cinnamon buns, which left me slightly disappointed. Overall, a great product

I am a huge fan of the creme, but not of this lip balm. For the price they want this should've been much, much better. It goes on nice and has a neutral taste and moisturizes ok. My L'Occitane Lip balm or just plain shea butter does a much better job moisturizing my lips than this does.  Save your money and do not buy this.

I have been searching for years for something to keep my lips from chapping, and this is it.  It's absolutely amazing, better than anything I have tried, and I have tried so many lip products.  The lemon custard flavor is delicious, too.  Put it on at night and in the morning your lips will be soft and smooth--This is the ultimate conditioner for your lips.

I first got a whiff of Blue in a magazine advertisement, when it came out and, it was love from that moment. I went out and purchased it and, this is all I wear now. It is all I want to wear. Nothing else compares to this, for me. I get so many compliments! I had one coworker once, who would walk by me just so he could smell it. He told me what he was doing, of course, he just loved the smell. People want to know what I am wearing and where they can purchase it. I feel great when I'm wearing it and, I will keep using it as long as they will make it

This fragrance took me quite by surprise when I first tried it from a magazine sample, so much so that I knew I had to try it at a department store - this was a little over a year ago. Then I sampled it at a department store and all my nose could think was "Wow!" - gardenias from my grandmother's garden, the suntan oils &amp; tropical perfumes that I smelled as a little girl at the beach, with a few more florals blended in that make this fragrance even more exotic and sensual - I knew I had to have it! I bought myself a bathgel and lotion set and put the large bottle of cologne on my X-mas list, which my sweet &amp; generous boyfriend got for me. 
In my opinion, this is probably the most alluring fragrance for women that I have ever smelled. I feel very alluring every time I wear it for my boyfriend - and he loves it! So this would be a great gift for a man's wife or girlfriend, or for a woman's best friend, sister or cousin (as long as you wear it for your own man, too!), but a slightly awkward gift to give to your mother, aunt or grandmother - it's that enticing. But if your single older relative or friend simply must have it as one of her gifts, then have it given by one of her female friends, sister, cousin or "Santa". That way there won't be any awkwardness at gift-giving time. Believe me - this fragrance is the olfactory equivalent of French lingerie or a string bikini!

I absolutly love ALL of Carol's daughter's products.  Everything to me is true to description.  I recieved my Almond Cookie gift set in the mail and I couldnt wait to open it. The smell is to die for, sometimes I open my Shea Souffle' just so I can smell it. I also love her labels and containers.  I will forever be a customer of Carol's Daughter and I look forward to the day where I can walk into one of her stores. Her prices are worth every dime. Remember you get what you pay for

I thank God for Carol's Daughter. I have finally found a quality product that makes me feel like I'm at the spa in my own home for a a resonable price. I rather pay $25.00 any day for spectacular service and a fantastic product any day than $10 so-so product filled with water and vaseline. I am a Carols daughter member so are my kids and most of my family. Kudos to Lisa Price for setting that much needed standard in the beauty industry.God Bless You Al

The mirror was very easy to install.  After using the mirror a couple weeks, the plane and magnifying mirrors are very clear and easy to adjust to the correct distance for great viewing.
The only negative is that the halo light does not provide sufficient brightness, but not an issue if mirror is used in a well lighted area

Gone are the days of overpriced department store products that do absolutly nothing for your skin! Gone are the days of spending too much money for a product that sits in your bathroom and collects dust!

This is stuff is kick ass!
If you are the type to buy a product that is endorced by a celebrity, then you can be satisfied here, and if you go to the Mario Badescu website you can see all the celebrities who have gone to the spa and used the products.

If you are looking for a product that makes your skin feel clean and fresh, without spending your paycheck, then you have found the perfect company!!!

I have been using the products from Mario Badescu for three years now, and I have gotten my Mom, Mother-in-Law, Sister, and other friends and family to become Mario Badescu junkies too.

That all said, if you want something to pamper yourself look no further.

(Try the Seaweed Soap, and the Orange Protective Cream. And if you have a problem with Pimples then look for the drying lotion, but beware its strong stuff.

I love this product.  I use it when my son spits up and it either goes on his face or body.  Sometimes it still stinks from the spit up after wiping with just a wipe so I pump a little of this on a wipe and it does the trick.  I have various Mustela products and they all work great

I got this product as a gift at a baby shower and wasn't sure how I was going to use it--I was a little unclear as to exactly what it was. . .is it soap? (no) is it astringent? (no) what the heck is it?  Answer:  it's a baby Windex! I have used this going on 4 years and 2 babies.  It removes any lingering stink from diaper changes, cleans spit-up off skin and leaves a nice fresh scent, removes macaroni and cheese and chee-tos from hands and faces, not to mention kool-aid, chocolate, spaghetti sauce residue. . .you name it, Physiobebe cleans it up.  Just pump some onto a cotton pad, wipe, or napkin, and clean off your kid.  I highly recommend it

The bottle itself is a real looker, with thick rich smooth glass encasing golden rich amber jewel like liquid on the inside. Fancy shmancy I said as I took it out of the delivery box. 
I opened the bottle to take a whiff and my oh my, it's definitely worth the price tag.
The real test of course came at bath time, and this sure delivered beyond looks alone.

The bath water turned bubbly and luscious with earthy aromas of warm, primrose vanilla and the rich, juicy and creamy finish of the apricot. This should be eaten, not bathed in!
Insanely delicious as it would make a wonderful present for any friend or relative, but better yet for yourself.

 Apparently this can be used as a body wash, and I am really looking forward to using it in the shower, as I'm a shower person in the morning, and this would make a tantalizing shower experience for sure. I have reviewed a few of these bath items today, and now I feel so sweet and sleepy after my bath that I feel extremely happy for getting this bubble bath. It's little delectable products such as this one that bring you calm and pleasantness after a long day, and nothing can replace some nice relaxation alone in the tub. Even my boyfriend loved the scent as he used it the other day, so it can be for both men and women, but I might have to hide it in case he secretly likes it too much!

I purchased this product over the summer 2006 when I became concerned about sun damage.  My only question about this product is whether the vitamin C in it is stable (i.e., should the product be refrigerated to maintain its potency?).  Regardless, it has a sufficient amount of vitamin C for the product to be worthwhile (10% - woo hoo!), and other vitamin C creams are much more expensive.  

The nice thing about this product is that a little really does go a long way.  You squeeze a small amount onto your finger (hygienic packaging!) and spread onto your face.  As the product spreads, it absorbs and has a silky finish.  I'm not sure why, but I have taken to mixing this product with a little bit of Cetaphil moisturizer and I love the result.  It does have an orangey citrus smell, but I am not bothered by it (which is rare).

This is a great finisher - use after you've drenched your hair with leave-in conditioner, and focus on the ends which tend to spread out and fly away and the little wispies at your temple and nape.  Smells great but doesn't compete with the smell of other products.  Only con: a little bit does NOT go a long way.  It's expensive to stock up

For a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is MAC. Lipglass feels good on your lips, as if it contained some emollients. And (this is a big AND) it's not tacky or sticky. 

The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. 

Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. 

Enjoy!

MAC LipGlass is the absolute best. There are plenty of colors to choose from, SUPER-Shiny, and the gloss is thick, stays on and doesn't run. 
The best colors are....
NICO for a cute lavender pink color with a glittery shine. 
OYSTERGIRL is a shimmery baby pink.
OH BABY is the perfect gloss for any earth toned lipstick.
CHAI looks amazing with black smokey eyes. It's the perfect neutral earthy gloss and has no glitter or shimmer - just pure shine

I'm REALLY anal about scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored with vanilla, but MAC LipGlass isn't that vanilla-ish at all!  It's got very pigmented color, it stays on a LONG time for a gloss, and each tube lasts a long time...  Don't let what the other reviewer said about the vanilla scent throw you off

I reach for CK One on days that I want a crisp, fresh scent.  Intended to be a unisex fragrance, it is not at all sweet or flowery.  However, it does have a softness to it that I personally believe makes it better suited to a woman than a man; I find it to be slightly musky without being masculine.  Overall, this is a really nice, neutral fragrance for everyday wear

I love this perfume, it's the best that I have in my collection.  It's not too strong but it's enough for everyone to notice.  I practically wear it everyday, and this size will usually last for a while

This is an amazingly fresh fragrance...It's a light, lush, and sparkling floral-fruity blend.  A lot of people asked me what I was wearing.  I highly recommend it for someone looking for a nice scent that they can wear all day.

I use both this mascara and Lancome Flextencils  when i'm going out, Flextencils first then coat with Hypnose.  My lashes look HUGE and not too clumpy.  Flextencils add great length, while Hypnose adds volume.  I use Hypnose by itself on just an average day.  Great Product! Makes my Lashes big and not clump

I've always used Lancome mascaras, before Hypnose, I used Denfincils.  Hypnose is a great mascara.  Never clumps, the non-waterproof version is easily removable, and your lashes look amazing.  Definately give this product a try

So far this is the best thickening mascara I have tried that are either sold in drug stores or at department stores. It is not sticky or gloppy and you won't look like Tammy Fay with spider lashes. I do however, have to apply two coats to bring out the more sparse areas of my lashes, but I have finally stopped my search for thickening mascaras. My journey ends here

       Tried and true might well describe the products offered by Caswell-Massey as generations have relied upon them for both quality and efficacy.  Established in 1752, it's America's oldest Chemist and Perfumer.  My grandmother enjoyed their products, and I do, too.

	Their Almond &amp; Aloe Liquid Soap is a boon because it not only cleanses well but moisturizes as it does so.  Far too many soaps leave skin feeling dry and itchy.

	Almond, as we  know, has a lovely distinctive fragrance as well as skin softening properties.  Combine it with aloe which contains healing properties, and you have a uniquely beneficial cleanser.

	Other ingredients include Vitamins A and D for nourishment.  This soap is particularly useful for those who wash their hands frequently during the day and for those with normal to dry or sensitive skin.

	Other items in Caswell-Massey's Almond &amp; Aloe line include Body Balm, Bath Seltzer, Cold Cream Soap, Hand Cream, Hand &amp; Body Emulsion, and Almond Body Splash

This bath melt was nice.  It smelled great but it is pretty sweet.  It didn't do anything spectacular to the water, just kind of made it look soapy.  The melt took it's time melting and the smell lasted throughout the bath.  I took the melt after it sat in the water for a while and rubbed it directly on my skin which made my skin smell nice.  It also moisturizes well and makes the water feel smooth and silky, but the smell didn't linger on my skin once I was out of the water

If you haven't tried Lush or Creamy Candy, do it! Creamy Candy smells delicious and leaves your skin silky soft. For soap to match, try Rock Star. Mmmmm!!! I can't place the fragrance; it's cherry, but not, cotton candy, but not - it's VERY sweet smelling and the scent lasts and lasts.  Enjoy

This is the best micro peel I have ever tried!  The thing I noticed first was that when I applied "when hope is not enough" and "the present"  they went on so smoothly.  They absorbed equally.  In my mid-30's, my young skin is fading, but this really brought it back.  I won't say I am 19 again, but I am sure the difference is obvious.  I am a hairstylist and my customers have been making mention of how great my skin looks since I added this to my bag of tricks.  It is a lot more effective that I would have thought, and I have not had a microdermabrasion since I started using this 2-4 times per month

I love, love this product. I can't believe how much I actually used it; I ran out of my box within two months! All those tops that have a wide open neck needed the bra strap to sit on the edge of my shoulder--this kept my straps in place all day and night! A few of my work tops have buttons that stop short towards the bottom; I use the strips to close the flap in place so it's smooth all the way down. Tip: in some cases I cut the strips in half; even half a strip holds my bra straps in place. This product holds things in place or down, it does not lift and hold--its not ducked tape.

The powder/foundation is excellent for skin which is oily and large-pored.
It is one of the best around for no-caking, no-oil, smooth surface skin.
If you can't stand the feel of cream or lotion foundations, Chanel does it best!!
Also, my seller was terrific

I love this foundation.  It is a easy one step process. I don't like to use liquid.  I need something easy, quick and foolproof. I am always in a hurry with 3 kids I don't have time for multi steps.  I also have acne and red cheeks.  This evens out my skin and covers my acne. My skin looks flawless. I have tried so many products including MAC, Bare Minerals, Lancome, Origins, Shiseido etc..  My only problem with this makeup is...
It is so expensive.  What do you expect, it's Chanel. Pure perfection

I absolutely love this kit. I love that I can use THE GREAT MYSTERY every morning and it isn't harsh on my skin and I love using THE GREATEST LOVE at night and when I wash it off it just melts into my skin I don't even have to put on a moisturizer. For something really nice try using THE GREAT MYSTERY and then put THE GREATEST LOVE on top of that. It's really amazing. The only caution I would have is when using THE GREATEST LOVE don't rub it in you have to massage it very lightly otherwise it will irritate your skin and can cause breakouts or make you feel like you have a sun burn.

I have been using this product for years.  I have a really oily T-zone, and I find that this product keeps it in control.  It is a very good cleanser that removes the oil without drying your skin.  No matter what color your skin tone may be, I think you will like this product!

This product is absolutely brilliant. In the past I have always had to go to the bathroom and blot with tissues and get my powder and puff out. Taking too long. Plus ending up with a cake face as the day goes on.
 With these powder papers, I can do it anytime discreetly, without having to use a mirror or a puff. Just a fresher face with a slight dusting of powder. Perfect

About 10 years ago, I began getting ingrown whiskers on my neck from shaving.  Not only did they not feel good (they'd itch, and were sensitive) but they looked horrible. The front of my neck was red, and I would have horrible red and white bumps all over the skin where whiskers would curl and grow back down into the skin.  I was totally self concsious, because it looked horrible.  The only thing I could for the longest time was pluck them with tweezers.  That took a lot of time, and digging into my skin to pull the hairs was very uncomfortable, and really didn't work that well.  I tried switching to an electric razor with little success.  I could not have a close shave on my neck without getting the horrible ingrown hairs.

I searched the web for months to try and find something that would work.  I found some advice for a few different things, but none worked.  I finally ran across a website of a distributor that was selling Tend Skin.  By that point I wasn't sure anything would work, but I was desperate for something, so I bought it.  I am SO glad I did.  It really works when you use it as directed, and you see results by the time you have to shave again.

I apply Tend Skin with a cotton ball or pad to my neck after I shave and dry my face.  I will then apply it again in the evening, and repeat each morning and night.  It does not take much at all.  I always buy the largest bottle for fear that one day Tend Skin will disappear!  If you have ingrown facial hair from shaving, you NEED to get this.  It is the only thing that I have found the works, and I am 100% happy with it.  It is rather pricey, but I never hesitate to buy because it is worth every penny to me.

The only small "complaint" I have about it is that it smells just a tad funny to me.  My wife says it smells fine to her, so I don't worry about it.  I wonder if they could make it with a slightly nicer smell - or none at all.  It really doesn't matter, though, because Tend Skin is AWESOME and I don't know what I'd do without it.

I can't speak to how effective it is for ingrown leg hair, etc. but I would imagine it would work the same

I have used Tend Skin for around three years now for razor bumps on the bikini line. Before I started using it, I had tried everything else and resigned to the fact that I'd always be stuck with bumps along the bikini line. A friend of mine told me about Tend Skin and swore by it, so I bought a small bottle. It seemed like it was expensive, but that first bottle lasted well over 6 months. It does smell like alcohol at first but the smell goes away when it dries. As far as the other reviews on here, I've only had stinging when I used it IMMEDIATELY after shaving...I think b/c the pores were still open from the shower. For me, it's been a skin saver when I'd already given up the search. I hope that the negative reviews on here don't discourage people from trying it. Everyone's skin reacts somewhat differently. Of the millions of bottles of Tend Skin sold every year, I think the half dozen people on here who didn't like it are the few unhappy rarities, not the average who, like me, thank goodness it's around.

This cream cleanser is wonderful! I have used the Clinique 3 step program since I was a teenager until I went to an at home Body Shop party and tried this cleanser. I have been using it ever since. It is so soft and creamy, feels great going on my skin, and leaves it feeling clean, smooth and moisturized. Its great at gently removing make-up in the evenings and is a nice pick me up first thing in the mornings

This fun fragrance comes across to me as soft and slightly sweet, with a feel that's both young and a bit sexy.  The scent is quite pretty, with a bit of floral, and the lightness of it makes it a perfect everyday scent (although it works well for romance, too!).  As mentioned above, the scent does have a youthful, fresh feel to it, and although I've heard some say that the fragrance is best for teens, I'm almost 40, and I enjoy it on days that I'm looking for something lighthearted and fun (granted, I probably wouldn't wear it everyday).  Lucky You comes in a cute pink bottle with a unique rubber stopper, and it has good staying power, although the scent grows more subtle over time.  Recommended for women of all ages who are young at heart

This is a very suttle fragrance, that lasts for hours. Slightly floral,however is a very intimate scent, most people need to get very close to notice, which can be good, but also a sign that you need to spray yourself all over. I would recommend picking this up if you want something to carry around in your purse to spray here and there. It last for hours but is not an "all day" perfume

I bought this perfume about one year ago with a gift certificate.
I was skeptical about purchasing perfume online but I was not dissapointed. This perfume is absolutely fabulous! When you first put it on the floral freshness and ruby grapefruit awakens your senses as the top notes. The middle notes included a powdery musk that is sensual yet not to woodsy. And the bottom notes of jasmine are so graceful yet grasping.
Buy this perfume. You will fall in love with it

Of all the higher end mascaras I've tried, this one is by far the best.  Your lashes look longer and thicker with just ONE coat and looks like natural great lashes, not made up.  The creamy gel formula goes on smooth, never clumps or feels sticky-and true to form, your lashes will curl up nicely.  Although not a water proof mascara, it has incredible staying power, cleans off easily.  I LOVE this mascara, won't look elsewhere

I have this product working in my hair right now. It is simply wonderful! 

First off, it smells like lovely Victorian rosebud-almond pudding. It has a similar consistency. I can get about three to four uses from each container and I have very thick hair. 

My hair was preciously quite dry and abused. I had dyed it twice in the last six months. After ONE use of this product my hair felt better than it had in YEARS. Silky, strong and shiny. I love this product! I highly recommend it.

I've been a fan of this product for a couple of years, since I have very long, wavy hair. It moisturizes really well and I use it every ten days or so. It smells like a weird salad dressing when you put it on, kind of vinegary and spicy, but when you wash it out the scent is toned down a bit. It still smells unusual (spicy and vaguely nutty), but not unpleasant.

I warm a good handful of this in the microwave, put it on my dry hair and tie it in a bun, wait 20 minutes, then shampoo it out using a liquid shampoo and condition with a light conditioner, like Coolaulin or a small amount of American Cream. If you have short hair you probably won't need this deep of a treatment, but for those of us with a lot of hair, or who have damaged or very thick hair, it is great. It makes my hair shiny and tangle-free again.

It doesn't have any of the silicones that commercial conditioners have, so if you are looking for that slick feeling you get from Pantene you won't find it here. But the ingredients in this don't build up in your hair the way silicones do, so for those of us who are making a conscious choice to avoid silicone buildup in our hair, this is a great deep conditioner

HI

<review_text>
HSuan Wen Hua Hair Treatment is one of the best hair treatments I've come across... and I'm a huge hair junkie and have tried MANY things.  Ever since finding LUSH several months ago, I have not even touched another brand of hair care.

HSuan Wen Hua Hair Treatment is made with fresh ingredients like bananas, avocadoes and fresh olive oil.  

You use this BEFORE you wash your hair, so apply it to DRY hair.  I usually put my hair up in a pony tail and only do the ends because that's where the damage is.  Then I twist my hair up in a bun and rubberband a plastic bag over it.  I try to leave it on as long as I can (overnight if I'm lucky), shampoo my hair and condition like regular after.  Because this is a treatment and not so much a hair conditioner, you still need to use a seperate conditioner.

The results are amazing and my hair is so much softer and in such better condition after use.  Since I only do the ends, it's easy to feel the difference between the ends of my hair that was treated and the rest of my hair that was not.

HSuan Wen Hua Hair Treatment is a M-U-S-T for my hair regime.  Definately recommended

 This treatment works extremely well!  I looked on here and saw that there were no extrememly helpful reviews, so I decided to write one. I have long, golden, untreated hair. However it was as dry as straw so I decided to try this. Here how it is: the smell is amazing (it smells like pumpkin pie or gingerbread cookies) after use the hair looks soft and shiny, however it makes hair flat. This product is a deep moisturizer therefore the hair does not have any "pouf" to it. It is still worth the money though! Rehydration of the hair is supremely important and this rehydrates well. Just after shampooing do not use a conditioner (unless that just doesn't work well for you), which helps the flatness. 

A few helpful tips:
1. This goes on DRY hair
2. After putting lots of this treatment on, try putting a bag over your hair and keeping it shut with a clip. The heat that your head produces allows the hair cuticles to open and fully absorb the treatment. This works 2Xs better than Lush's intstructions (my mother is a hairstylist).
3. Leave the bag tight around your head for 20 to 40 minutes
4. Afterwards shampoo like normal, but I still recommend not using a conditioner for that day.

Hopefully this helps anyone with questions. This really is an amazing product and should be used about twice a month (more if you'd like but that's probably not necessary). Enjoy your beatiful shiny hair!

I love this product.  My eye brows are growing, but not all over in the areas where I'm putting the product.  The hair has become darker, but nothing extreme, just in a way where I'm able to see it now (I'm naturally a toehead).  I would recommend this to others, but I'm saddened that it's so hard to find, and I was unable to do so in a store

I am a fan of Ralph Lauren and check new products from this brand. I liked this scent, although I am probably more used to Polo Blue, which is also great. It is better to get an idea in a store because it is not quite possible to decide from reviews. Anyway, it is worth checking especially if you are looking for a new cologne for St. Valentine's day

At first spray, this can be a pretty potent cologne, but after 1-2 minutes this fades into a nice rosey spice scent that is much lighter than it's green original polo brother. lasts all day long and into the night. Worth checking out if you are a fan of cool water and lotto, or lighter scented cologne.

If you like the citrusy scent of other Fresh products (as I do) then you will probably really like this lip balm. It has a lovely lemony taste, and a soft, smooth texture. It's not waxy or greasy, and my husband likes to kiss me when I have it on! The only reason that I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it doesn't last as long as I'd like. My lips tend to get pretty chapped in the winter, and I put balm on at night to condition my lips. This one is gone after about 30 minutes to an hour, so I need a much more concentrated lip balm (like Bliss balm) for night use. But if you're looking for a light, yummy balm, this might be it

This has to be by far one of the best lip treatments on the market.  Pricy...yes.  But well worth every cent.  In as few as two uses my lips have gone from cracked to whole.  Tastes as good as it smells.  Lemon...brownsugar..like the body scrub of the same name.  
My only complaint: it doesn't have the longevity of say Prada's lip balm (which I use when running)

I love these inserts!  I had trouble finding ones this size.  Not too big, not too small.  They definitely help me to fill out my bras!  I would suggest putting them in bras with pockets for inserts.  I tried just setting these in my bra, but if I moved my arms up and my bra moved around, I was afraid that the cupcakes would fall out.  These are a great product though

lipstick going. This review is for the Guava Stain shade. I first bought this lipstick, I believe in the mid to late eighties. I was delighted with it then and am now. It is sheer, light, non greasy and the color never changes. The color is NOT neutral, but I find that I can wear it with almost any color of clothing except primarily pink or red outfits. Over the years it has become just about the only lipstick shade I wear. I would buy different brands,different shades and wear them maybe once then back to Guava Stain. It along with Clinque's soft pressed blush in New Clover, orginally bought about the same time as the lipstick have become my favorites, and the one's I reach for time and again. They are my dependables. Daytime wear for sure, not night, this is a subtle sheer color

This is a great item from LUSH.  It works so well, lasts a very long time and is worth every penny.  First off the scent.  It is dead-on fresh coconut.  Not the fake sun tan oil/beach smell you'd expect.  It makes a TON of creamy, thick lather with only a few swipes through (soaking) wet hair.  It cleasnes really well and rinses clean.  For me, there was no residue left behind, only softness.  As I said, it does last for ages BUT you have to make sure you leave it in a well ventilated soap dish with a drain.  If it's left in water, say goodbye to it in a couple of days, as you will be left with a mushy mess half the size of when you left it.

Try it at least once, if it doesn't work for your hair... it's also great to shave with

but it definitally did not work as it was intended. It is intended to moisturize hair. I have long, fine, oily hair, and I received Trichomania as a gift. I love the smell, but when I first used it, it left my hair very dry which I consider a good thing considering the state of my hair. It just didnt do what it was supposed to. However, if you have really oily hair, this is the thing for you. No problems with lathering either, especally if you rub the bar in your hair, not in your hands. Doesnt leave white flakes either

If you have dry hair, Trichomania is for you. 

It smells like real coconuts, not that synthetic crap in suntan lotions, and works wonders on my dry, colored, and generally abused hair. Plus, it lasts forever. All of Lush's solid haircare lasts much longer than bottled stuff and contains no silicones. They do take some getting used to but once you adjust, everything else will smell so chemical and you'll wonder why you ever used them.

I've tried several eye shaddow bases including Laura Mercier and find the Laura Geller Eye Spackle to last the longest.  I generally have my makeup on by 6:00AM and keep in on until 9:30 PM.  It looks as great at night as it did in the morning.  I definitely recommend this product

I first smelled this perfume on a colleague of mine, about a year ago. Every time she walked by me I got a whiff of this heavenly scent that she wore nearly every day. So, I finally stopped her and asked what she was wearing. I'd never heard of it, so I jumped online and looked it up, found a bottle and bought it. I couldn't wait to try it out, so when the perfume finally arrived I put it right on. Imagine my disappointment when I smelled a scent totally unlike the one I'd experienced. On me it was overpoweringly musky, nothing like the seductive fragrance I'd smelled on my colleague. But, an odd thing happened. I didn't wash it right off, and when I smelled it again about 30 minutes later it had become the alluringly sensual perfume I'd fallen in love with. In fact, the longer I wore it the better it smelled. Obviously it depends on your body chemistry to achieve it's bloom. Now, I wear it when I go out in the evenings, and people comment on how wonderfully sexy it smells. If you buy this perfume don't judge it too quickly, as I did....give it a little time and you're sure to love it. You only need to use a little, and it lasts for HOURS.

Works exceptionally well.  Clears pimple faster than other types of treatments I have used and reduces the redness very quickly.  My 2 teenage daughters love the product as well.  Because such a small amount is needed a tube will last a long time.  Will definitely buy it again!

Murad Acne Spot Treatment really works to drive away those unsightly blemishes!  It heals even the big nasty pimples in a few days, with the smaller ones healing in hours.  It really does help to minimize the appearance of most acne after I apply it, too.  Overall I would say it is a great produce for anyone who, like me, considers even minor acne to be a major annoyance

I have this lip gloss in Sweetie and will be trying other shades.  I am very pleased with it!  I wear it over stay-on type lip colors in other brands, and it keeps my color on all day (even after eating)!  It doesn't really feel too sticky if you blot after application.  I only wish it tasted as good as it smells (not that it tastes bad, it's just blah)!

I love this lip gloss, the cake batter taste/smell is totally addictive.  The colors are lacking though, all of the colors are light, very sheer shades. I bought the color Babydoll which is a light pink.  It goes on sheer and I love the smooth texture too. This product is supposed to have glitter in it but I didnt' notice any, and/or its not too glaring, which makes it fine for me to wear it at work.

These bristles have just the right combination of softness and strength.  However, since I only use this as a back scrub brush, the detachable design is not optimal for me.  After a few months, the brush-handle attachment point became compromised (probably from all the exposure to water), and I found that the brush would often detach from the handle as I scrubbed my back.  At this point, many more months down the road, the brush no longer stays mounted to the handle at all, so I am looking for a (non-detachable) replacement.  Even so, I recommend this product because of it's great bristles, and also because the handle was great while it lasted.

The tounge-and grove way the handle detached make it easy to use in the shower (dont have my glasses on).  The detachable brush has medium soft bristles and will be easy on the skin.  The strap on the brush is cotton, so this probably isn't a once-in-a lifetime purchase, but very good for the price.  Everybody needs one

L'Occitane's Lavender Harvest Matte Face Lotion *really works* to mattify oil and makes a nice makeup primer. 

I don't have oily skin, but tried some samples over a night serum I was using with avocado oil to mattify it, so my face wouldn't be greasy on my pillow.  It left my skin feeling satiny and smooth.  Avocado is one of the heavier, thicker oils and did wonders for my dry skin, but I hated the feel of it, so finding this was a real bonus to fix that problem.  

Lavender oil also has relaxing aromatherapeutic properties, is a natural antiseptic which helps prevent blemishes, and mosquitoes don't like it, so if you have oily skin and live in a humid climate in the summer, you should try this! 

Note: I have had good luck shopping with L'Occitane through Amazon, but called first to make sure what I was ordering was in stock on their website.

This is the only fragrance I have found that truly smells "tropical".  This is my boyfriends favorite scent, and he thinks all perfumes "stink".  The four stars is because it takes this spray awhile to go from greasy and oily to dry.  You have to wait awhile before you get dressed.  But it smells great

Mistral, as many know, is a powerful, gusty wind that blows across the south of France. Mistral, as I was happy to discover, is also the name of a line of bath and body products, all French inspired, all lusciously lovely from scented soaps to soothing lotions to rejuvenating body butters. 

Matthew Tilker, founder and president of Mistral, utilizes Shea butter, which is an efficacious natural healer, in a myriad of must-have forms. Derived from the nuts of the African Shea Tree (according to sacred custom the nuts are harvested primarily by women), this butter is highly emollient, a boon for those with dry skin, chapped lips, any number of skin irritations. 

The pure Shea Butter soap comes in a plethora of inviting fragrances, all milled six times (while others boast being triple milled). South Seas is a particular favorite - it's as fresh as an ocean breeze and as calming, soothing as a tropical island. The marine scent is accented with a touch of grapefruit, white flowers and soft woods. An irresistible combination. 

South Seas is a fragrance with which you wish to surround yourself - made possible by the shower gel, body lotion, massage bath and body oil, bath salts and candle all available at very accessible prices.

I have searched far &amp; wide for a product that aids in the treatment/management of keratosis pilaris (little red bumps on the backs of my arms).  It is estimated that 40-50% of the population has a form of keratosis pilaris and there is no cure for the skin condition.

However, this Neostrata AHA 8 significantly reduced bumps and redness after only 2 weeks.  After 4 weeks, it had almost vanished.  The only drawback is that after 2-3 weeks of non-use the bumps tend to resurface.  But, if you keep the application up, the bumps stay away!  I use it religiously over the summer or if i have any upcoming special occasions where I want to look my best.

I found the product in SELF magazine, suggesting its use for keratosis pilaris management and have nothing but rave reviews!!  Finally, something that works

Although this is supposed to be used as a deep conditioning treatment I used it several times a week and loved the way it made my hair look and feel.  Only drawback is the price, and the container, which you have to be very careful with in the shower!  But all in all, it's a wonderful product for fine hair and I've come back to it again and again!

I've been using this kit for several weeks now, and I am absolutely amazed at the results!  I've had severe acne scarring due to a birth control pill I was taking.  They were bright red, and no concealer on the market would cover them.  After one week of using Murad, I've noticed the scars fading!  I thought nothing on this planet would fade them, but Murad is!  I've also been blessed with good genes in having oily skin.  Murad drastically reduces the amount of shine I have.  I highly recommend this product to everyone

I've been using Murad for about 3 weeks now, and it has made a huge difference! I am in my early 20's and have had problems with mild breakouts since my teens. I've tried drugstore products, wich never seemed to make any difference, and Proactive which was so harsh it actually burned and made my skin much worse. Murad is gentle enough for me to use twice a day, and has left my skin breakout free! It has also improved the texture and feel of my skin, and makes my pores nearly invisible. I recomend Murad to anyone whose skin is breakout prone but too sensitive for the benzoyle peroxide formulas in other acne products. The only complaint I have about Murad is the price - it can be a little much for a poor college student - but the results are worth it if you can afford it!

yes, i've had murad for about 2 weeks now and i've seen huge improvement! murad is a godsend! anyways... i was just wondering if the kit is really supposed to last me 2 months? i use it every morning and night. thats 120 times! umm... dont know if im gonna have any left... i know for sure the cleanser i will. (step 1) but steps 2 and 3 are very small quantity... and hopefully i wont need a lot of acne spot treatment usage cause they'll be all gone :) i definately recommend murad to everyone. like others, i've tried proactiv, but murad seems to work better with my skin. just try the one month starter kit first

I discovered the Murad Acne Complex Kit about six years ago and have been using it since... It cleared my acne up within weeks and has kept the acne away. Some products I tried dried my skin out but Murad Acne Complex leaves it feeling clean and hydrated without all the chemical smells. I recommend anyone with acne try Murad Acne Complex to see if it will work as well for you.

I love this product. It takes only a few drops to make my hair shine. It is light, smells quite nice and is not at all overpowering or strong smelling. I don't buy cheap fragrances, so I don't know what "bad perfumes" reviewer NycoleB is comparing this with. I suppose everyone's body chemistry is different. I haven't found any other product that does what this does so I'll be buying another bottle when this one is done

I was amazed by the quality of this product when I first purchased it in the summer of 2006.  It gives my hair a perfect sheen and softness that I have never achieved with such lightweight hair oil before and my hair has acheive lengths that I have not seen in years!  Tui Hair Oil has a beautiful scent which does not change over the course of wearing it in your hair for a day or two, or even longer if you wish.

I think that this product does what it promises to do.  It is a "freshen-up" mist.  I use it everymorning (I shower before bed) before I blowdry my hair and it creates volume and makes my hair look awesome!  It is only short of the full 5 stars because it does not last all day, but it is definitely good for a few hours.  Even after it wears off, my hair is not flat.  It still has enough texture that I can just put my hands through it to get the "messy" look.

I don't think that it smells bad.  The smell actually reminds me of some spa products taht I use

This is a great idea for a product! For those of you who don't wash your hair every day, this is a great way to keep it looking and smelling fresh on days you don't wash it. I used this after 5 days without washing, and while it might have worked better within 3 or 4 days, it still freshened my hair and made it beautiful! Well done

I moved to an area with city water (which I was not used to), not too long ago.  I noticed that my hair and skin seemed to turn dull and gray after some time.  No matter what hair and skin products I tried using, the result was the same.  After reading about this product in a health magazine, I decided to give it a shot since it received such high praise.  I am thrilled with my purchase!  I saw almost instant results.  My skin has never felt softer.  The filter system itself was very easy to install and required no tools.  For anyone with harsh, chlorine laden city water, I highly recommend this product

I purchased a Beauty Water Shower Purification System and have used it about 5 times now with fantastic results. I have very hard water in my home and am tired of constantly having to blow dry my hair or having to use tons of products for it to be manageable and not frizzy.  My hair felt very soft and manageable using this product and I am hoping it helps my highlights last longer.  I did not experience that 'slimy' feeling people usually associate with soft water.  I'm even able to let my hair air dry and not be frizzy with this product.  I am curious to see how long this filter lasts.  I called Jonathan Products and was told that they do have a replacement filter that costs $55 so you can save a bit of money when you need to replace the filter

I watched Blow Out and figured the product was flying off the shelves because of the show's popularity.  I ordered some because the ingredients sounded nice, plus he did seem sincere when formulating, etc.  I have blonde hair, color treated, thick, long lengths.  I've bought high-end hair products for 20 yrs from beauty salons and stores and have never used anything that made my hair feel like Jonathan Product.  You can immediately tell it's stripping and cleansing your hair.  Then, the conditioner,  with it's exotic fragrance,  is the most wonderful conditioning treatment I've ever used.  My hair looks cleaner and has more body than ever before with just shampoo &amp; conditioner.  I'll use it as long as it's available to me

Some highlights are the all day long hold, ease of use, resistance to moisture (rain won't ruin your hair), low shine, strong yet natural hold, and good smell (which is rare).

I've used numerous hair products before but now, this is the only one I ever consider using

I am a big fan of this product.  My hair is very strong.  It needs a product which can keep it tamed.  However, most products that have that level of strength also come with high sheen or gloss which, in my opinion, is a bad look for today's fashions.  The matte look is more flexible.  American Crew Fiber gives me pliability and a matte look with a very strong hold.  It also smells nice.... not to strong and not too girly

I have been using this product for over 5 years as an alternative to gel or bed head.  The results are great. No unwated shine, no gooiness, very easy to wash off. 
Your hair wont feel stiff and wont get damaged. Reasonably priced and more available every day.

This is a great product for getting the bed head look.  I can use approximately a dime size worth in my palms and go wild!  Trust me, the results are great.  If you apply too much, you're hair will get oily. The good thing is that this product washes out easily with any Shampoo

Well I am very impressed with this.  I also have tried so many different shampoos and this is one of the best, if not the best, I've used.  I say that because whether I straighten my hair or leave it curly, this shampoo makes it feel and look and smell great.  It feels so nice and clean.  I don't rinse twice with this because it's unnessesary.  
I tried this because of watching Blow Out and on my last trip to America I bought a couple of bottles.  It's one of the best purchases I made.  Most girls buy shampoos etc based on packaging and smell and let me tell you, not only does it look and smell great, but what it does for your hair is amazing and apparently it's very low in damaging chemicals.  I won't hesitate to buy more of Jonathan's products next time I go.  I love this and can't say enough about it

I got a sample of this conditioner when I bought a similar product by another company.  I didn't care for the one I purchased, but the sample was awesome and I am going to buy the Jonathan conditioner.  I have always had fine limp hair and tried lots of volume products.  I used this for a week and this is the only thing I have ever seen any kind of difference with.  I love it!

After reading the other reviews I was a little worried about using the product I had already ordered.  After using it for a few days now my hair has never looked better, I truly feel like this shampoo/conditioner was meant for me.  I have fine, super straight hair, middle to short.  It feels clean and sleek. The conditioner smells like pina coloda, yum!  I would definatly recommend this for my hair type.  Would maybe recommend to lather the shampoo in your hands first then work thoroughly( it doesn't lather as well as some shampoos that have lots of glycerine in them) and only apply the conditioner towards the end of your hair and leave in for a few min.  Hope that helps

This is the second product of Jonathan's I've used and I'm equally happy with it.  I have thin hair when it's straight, and something in the middle when it's curly.  Either way, I'd like it thicker, and this foam certainly helps.  It's great and I've found it does what it promises.  It smells good and you don't need to use too much.  It feels nice in my hair and the fragrance lasts most of the day.  It doesn't matter if your hair is curly or straight, hopefully you will find this as effective and as helpful as I have

I heard about Jonathan products from watching QVC. I was a bit skeptical at first about buying his products because the price was a bit high.  I usually use Paul Mitchell or Matrix products.  Well rest assured, this was the absolute best product I have ever used to create lots of volume in my hair. My hair is fine and straight with a little bit of natural wave in the back. Other products I used would create a little volume but this stuff really made a huge, visible difference.  My boyfriend also commented how thick my hair looked.  This goes on nice and light and the scent is terrific, not a heavy smell, a light fresh smell.  I highly recommend this product and will definitely buy it again.

I just had my fine, processed hair cut into a short layered wedge.  It was shoulder length before and I used a Revlon thermal-air styler to make it acceptable.  After using Dirt, I no longer have to spend ANY time styling it!!  I just blow dry, scrunching my hair with my fingers and when almost dry, I turn my head upside-down and apply about a dime size amount of Dirt into the roots. Flip up and I'm ready to go all in less than 3 minutes.  I find it important to rub Dirt between my palms to warm it up before applying.  Use a little first...you can always add more. It gave my hair great body and control. Hope this product works for you too

I'll admit, with a well receded hair line I still tried to get what's left to be manageable and look good - everything else I've used left my hair dry, flaked off or didn't hold.  Jonathan Dirt has solved this long-term issue for me in just the first few days of use.  Dirt provides the manageability, hold and look I've strived for and even smells great with its almond scent.  I recommend this without reservation

I love this product!  My mother is a hair dresser so I have tried every product there is, and this one is my favorite.  If you use it properly then it's amazing.  It's a texturizing paste, not super glue, you can't expect amazing hold out of it.  And because it is a PASTE, it's extremely thick so you only need a tiny amount.  I have short, thin, wavy hair that I flat iron, and I just rub my fingers along the top of the paste to just get a thin layer on the tips of my fingers and apply it to my roots, it works amazing for volume, and I've never had a problem with it weighing my hair down or looking greasy!

Don't expect miracles from this product.  It does exactly what it claims to do!  Plus, it smells amazing!  Oh, and also...I am NOT in love with Jonathan nor his TV show, I bought this product before I had even heard of him or his TV show...I honestly find him a little annoying, but this product definitely isn't

<review_text>
Dirt has proven to be an amazing product...I'm "wowed" with how great it works!  I have a layered, razor cut that flips out and, before, was using three other products (pomade-for shine, manipulator-for flip, and aquage paste-for volume).  I just received Dirt last week, and after putting on just a bit, got the look that I was wanting, without all the hassle of three different products.  Yes, it's a bit pricey but well worth it (considering you only have to use a little, you're sure to save $$$).  and the smell, ::sigh:: is so great!  (Even if it hadn't worked as great as it does, I think I would still purchase it just for the delicious scent)  :)  I love that I can run my fingers through my hair and it's soft and manageable, even at the end of the day, and without the sticky "gunk" feel.  I definitely plan on purchasing other Jonathan Products

Awesome product.  As an old product used to use the slogan "a little dab'l do ya", it is true with this product.  Don't over do it or you'll have a greasy mess.  Start with a little and add more if you need to.  Always melt by rubbing hands together first.  Smells great too!  My only beef is the price.  Most of us aren't used to paying those Rodeo Drive prices, Jonathan.  $26 may not be a lot to you, but....  :)

As a working mom in her mid-forties, I am ever hopeful when it comes to product claims of time savings and beauty enhancement.  And so, when I read about the T3 Tourmaline Ionic Hair Dryer, I just had to have one.  With a price tag of $200, I figured the claims just had to be true.

The T3 is a sleek, beautiful and lighweight hairdrying and styling tool.  With its ionic particle things, it sounds so scientific, too.  But does it do what it says it will do?

For me, it's hard to tell.  It does dry at least as fast as my old 1800 watt hair dryer but with seemingly less heat.  So arguably, it is faster.  Less heat also means less hair damage.  So arguably, that is a beauty enhancement.  Is my hair sleeker and shinier?  Again, hard to tell.  No one at the office the next day seemed to notice any change.

One thing that I do notice, however, is that I like the idea of using an ionic hair dryer.  For whatever reason, I do think it is good for my hair.  And I suppose that in and of itself is enough to make this purchase entirely worthwhile

I did not believe the hype but read the other reveiws.  I have long hair and it would normally take me 30 minutes to dry my hair with my $15 drug store purchased hair dryers...I was pretty much used to that.  Often times I would let my hair dry naturally rather than blow dry it because of the hassle and time - not because it looked better, it looked terrible.  This dryer dries my hair in 15 minutes (fully blown under and styled), on top of that my hair is shiny when it's done and not dry.  I just bought one for my mom and would recommend this blow dryer for anyone that normally spends more than 20 minutes drying their hair, you will absolutely cut the dry time 50%.  Great purchase!

I have long, thick, wavy hair that loves to frizz up.  I have tried every anti-frizz, hairstyling product out there, and they either didn't work or weighed my hair down.  I didn't want to like this hair dryer and was hoping it wouldn't live up to the hype... BUT, it's excellent on my hair.  After using the dryer (with no styling product) my hair was straight, shiny and felt great.  For me, it didn't change the amount of time I dried my hair, so if your considering buying it for speed, don't, unless you have thin or short hair.  Is it worth the $200.00 price tag?  Depends on you personally, but I recommend you shop around because there are better deals out there

I had stopped using a regular hair dryer a few of months ago as I felt that my hair was becoming brittle and looking damaged.  However air drying my hair seemed to take forever. It was then that I heard about the T3 tourmaline Professional Ionic Hair Dryer from my hairdresser.  Initially the $200 price tag did put me off and I pushed the idea aside. But somehow it remained somewhere in the corner of my mind and one fine day after getting late for a meeting yet again, I decided to bite the bullet and buy the hairdryer. 

And I tell you, I have never been happier using a hair dryer. My hair started looking better and less damaged in the first few weeks itself. It has become smooth and silky and has a healthy glow.  Though the weight and the time taken were almost similar to my old model, the after effect is worth the price paid. The product does come with a 4-year warranty which is an added advantage to justify the exorbitant price. Though the sales brochures uses a lot of scientific terms like ionic mineral and blah... blah... I am not going to bother about it much as far as my hair appears healthy and saves me time so that I don't have to deal with being late for meetings. I   recommend this product to all who would love to have a mane to be proud of

I absolutely love this hairbrush! I have curly hair and like to blow it out often and until now I have not been impressed with any brushes. This brush holds the hair in pace when blowing dry and also lets you move it with your hair and dose not hurt as some can or get stuck. You will not be sorry if you are looking for the perfect brush to go with your perfect dryer (the featherweight)! Oh another thing I like is it extremely easy to keep clean.

Bazooka bubble gum with a touch of cinnamon. The sent/flavor is not too much. The gloss is not very hot, less than "venom" closer to "the balm" in hotness. I did't see any lip changes but I never do with any lip plumper glosses. The container is beautiful. Love the rollerball tip. This stuff brings me back to my 80's bonniebell days

As a lip gloss addict, I have easily over 200+ glosses. Too Faced Fat Kiss is by far one of my favorites. The superb shine makes my lips look so good! Although it doesn't really plump, it still tastes like cinnamon, and it will warm you up in winter. I have two different colors, because I like it so much! I strongly reccomend getting a couple, so you can keep them in your purse, make up bag, car...Everywhere! This rocks sooo much

The T3 Tourmaline Ceramic Iron is a wonderful product. Gets hot fast. Straightens and flattens my big curly hair with ease. Narrow so can get sideburns without fear. Terribly easy to use even for a novice like me.  Only problem, some gaps at top of straigtening area that catch stray hairs and usually pull them out. Luckily I have plenty of hair.

I have been using the volumizing shampoo and conditioner for 2 weeks.  I love this product!  No build up, No dandruf.  Make sure your hair is wet, not just damp, and you should not have a "lathering problem".  I purchased this from QVC and I will definately be a repeat customer.  I have short hair, so this will last me a while.  I loved it so much I bought some for my daughter.  This is my new shampoo

After reading the reviews of Jonathan's products, I wasn't completely sure I would like them, but wanted to try the shampoo, conditioner and Dirt after seeing him demonstrate Dirt on TV.  I have very fine, bodyless hair that is short and  high- and low-lighted.  I usually use Aquage products because they don't weight my hair down and especially  like the thickening spraygel for body.

Jonathan products smell great.  Additionally, I had no problem with the size of the bottles.  The quantity is probably the same as any other good product.  First the volumizing shampoo:  it lathered just fine and I used only a small amount.  I could feel the volumizing effect right after rinsing, after which I used the volumizing conditioner.  Again, no problem.  I decided to forego the thickening spraygel that I usually use in order to give Dirt an honest try.

I think I need a little more practice with this product since I am not a hairdresser.  I used the smallest amount and my hair was slightly damp.  I also need a haircut at the moment.  Next time I will put it on completely dry hair and apply it from the bottom going up and underneath.  It worked okay, but I need to get used to it.

Bottom line:  try it...you'll like it.  Sandra in Tuls

He said, "Your skin looks really nice." And he never notices anything! I told him it was makeup since he actually bought it for me at my request and I wanted him to know it was money well spent. I like to use it in conjunction with Benefit's Dandelion powder for a fresh, natural glow. I really do feel younger and prettier with it on, and I can't say that about many/any other comsetics I've tried. Totally worth it

BeneFit's "supermodel in a bottle" lives up to the hype. You only have to use a tiny bit of this in key places to attract light and create an ethereal glow... this is the perfect little potion to use when you really want to make an impact. It is a pearlized light pink that blends easy, stays put and adds a little drama. One of my all-time beauty favorites

High Beam is really pretty!  I love using it as a highlighter on my "big night outs".  I swipe it on my nose to make my nose seem slimmer, right above my blush on my cheeks, and above my eyebrows near the arches.  It really gives my skin a dewy and glowing look. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's very goopy and sticky.  It actually scared me a bit to put it on my face because the product is so thick that if you turn the jar upside-down, it won't run!  But overall, I still think this is a terrific product

I love the Benefit line, everything I have tried works great (not to mention they have great packaging and catchy names for all their products!). 

That said, High Beam is simply amazing. It only takes a little dab to add a nice glow/shimmer to my face. I especially like to use it on the cheek bones as it leaves a nice soft glow. High Beam works so much better for me than other products I've tried that either left my skin sticky or chalky. Not to mention those other products cost a lot more!

If you are looking for a little glow, a little shimmer, High Beam is the answer

I have used a similar product in a compact by Chanel and paid $50. It wasn't too long before I saw the end of it either. Now with Benenfit's High Beam I can get the effect for less than half the price so I'm a happy customer. I put this on my cheek bone and brush blush over it for glimmery, dewy cheeks. It's a very youthful look. It's not unnatural but it's better than natural. It's supernatural. Since I started wearing it people don't know exactly what I've added but they comment that my skin looks particuliarly good. You can control the highlighting effect by how much you use but I like to use a generous amount. My skin really does beam.

I recently discovered Benefit products. This is a great product if you want to add a little glow to your skin. I use it to highlight my cheek bones. You can use it any where you want a glance to linger. The best thing about this product is the smallest amount makes a big difference in your skin. I suggest you try this product. It works wonders.

I am a professional hairstylist and use this iron...I think it works the best, leaves the hair shiny and soft, however I have no idea why the company would recommend using it on wet hair, unless you want to spend all day doing your hair!  Dry your hair prior to using and get unbelievable results that last

This is by far the greatest thing I have ever seen.  I have struggled with curly/frizzy hair for 40 years.  I have tried all the serums, smoothers, and spent 30-40 minutes blowing out (15 with the iron once you get the feel for it), only to have it only last a day.  I use this with NO PRODUCT.  My hair is slick, smooth, silky (Jennifer Aniston-ish).  I put a bit of leave in conditioner just on the ends when I'm done.  Sleep on it, wake up ready to go...last several days.  P.S.  It's also muggy and humid here and it still looks great

Having wild and uncontrollable hair as a woman is a well-documented problem, but what about if you're a guy?  After years of using cheap gels that left flakey residues in my hair, and/or smelling feminine, I was introduced to American Crew in the little brown jar by a stylist.  I now swear by this stuff.  Even on my knappy head (I have very thick wavy, but not curly, hair) American Crew keeps my hair in place and natural-appearing without lookling like I'm using Brill's Cream.  A thick dime-sized dab is enough for keeping my short haired coiffure in place and de-poofed all day. The trick is to work it in while my hair is moist from the shower but not dripping wet. Yes, it costs way more than gels but it's worth every penny.  One 4 oz jar lasts me about 6 weeks. The other benefit to American Crew is the smell - my wife absolutely loves the way my hair smells

If Jonathan wants to sell environmentally concious products he should promote it in his other hairstyling products. The aquasana shower filter  is an excellent product which i use .Whats it matter who's name is on it. It is what it is and it will leave your skin and hair feeling fresher.

I moved to an area with city water (which I was not used to), not too long ago.  I noticed that my hair and skin seemed to turn dull and gray after some time.  No matter what hair and skin products I tried using, the result was the same.  After reading about this product in a health magazine, I decided to give it a shot since it received such high praise.  I am thrilled with my purchase!  I saw almost instant results.  My skin has never felt softer.  The filter system itself was very easy to install and required no tools.  For anyone with harsh, chlorine laden city water, I highly recommend this product

Well first off, I'm a guy with very short hair...so I don't know whether or not it really works. But I'm bored and decided to rate it anyway. So here goes:

Cons

Conditioner is really thick and difficult to get out of the bottle. The best solution for this is to let the bottle sit upside down. 

Pros

Smells DAMN good. I'm not a big fan of fruity/coconut aromas, but I like this particular smell so much that I might need to go to rehab sometime in the future. 


Bottom Line: Although this conditioner is difficult to get out of the bottle, it smells really good. Whether or not it will work for your hair, the only way to know is to try it. And even if ot doesn't work for your hair...it's worth the 20 bucks just to open it up and smell it every now and then. =)

Bazooka bubble gum with a touch of cinnamon. The sent/flavor is not too much. The gloss is not very hot, less than "venom" closer to "the balm" in hotness. I did't see any lip changes but I never do with any lip plumper glosses. The container is beautiful. Love the rollerball tip. This stuff brings me back to my 80's bonniebell days

This is absolutely the greatest shampoo ever! I've been abusing my hair for at least 30 years, and I have never had my hair looking and feeling as healthy as it does now. There is no better product for your hair on the market. All others are full of damaging detergents and chemicals with a dose of silicone thrown in to make you think your hair is clean, but you're killing it. I admire Jonathan for not treating us like idiots by being THE ONLY shampoo that doesn't tell you to lather, shampoo, and rinse twice, but you do need to. And you need to use no more than a dime-size amount of the Jonathan conditioner. My hair has never looked or felt so good

I heard about Jonathan products from watching QVC. I was a bit skeptical at first about buying his products because the price was a bit high.  I usually use Paul Mitchell or Matrix products.  Well rest assured, this was the absolute best product I have ever used to create lots of volume in my hair. My hair is fine and straight with a little bit of natural wave in the back. Other products I used would create a little volume but this stuff really made a huge, visible difference.  My boyfriend also commented how thick my hair looked.  This goes on nice and light and the scent is terrific, not a heavy smell, a light fresh smell.  I highly recommend this product and will definitely buy it again.

It's the best product I've used to create volume and hold.  I didn't notice it after blow drying, but, while using the curling iron and styling - my hair had a lot more volume and great hold.  I have straight, fine, limp hair and it is very difficult to get it to hold a style.  I truely noticed a big difference.  I plan to purchase the other volumizing products, once they are in stock.

The T3 Tourmaline Ceramic Iron is a wonderful product. Gets hot fast. Straightens and flattens my big curly hair with ease. Narrow so can get sideburns without fear. Terribly easy to use even for a novice like me.  Only problem, some gaps at top of straigtening area that catch stray hairs and usually pull them out. Luckily I have plenty of hair.

After reading the reviews of Jonathan's products, I wasn't completely sure I would like them, but wanted to try the shampoo, conditioner and Dirt after seeing him demonstrate Dirt on TV.  I have very fine, bodyless hair that is short and  high- and low-lighted.  I usually use Aquage products because they don't weight my hair down and especially  like the thickening spraygel for body.

Jonathan products smell great.  Additionally, I had no problem with the size of the bottles.  The quantity is probably the same as any other good product.  First the volumizing shampoo:  it lathered just fine and I used only a small amount.  I could feel the volumizing effect right after rinsing, after which I used the volumizing conditioner.  Again, no problem.  I decided to forego the thickening spraygel that I usually use in order to give Dirt an honest try.

I think I need a little more practice with this product since I am not a hairdresser.  I used the smallest amount and my hair was slightly damp.  I also need a haircut at the moment.  Next time I will put it on completely dry hair and apply it from the bottom going up and underneath.  It worked okay, but I need to get used to it.

Bottom line:  try it...you'll like it.  Sandra in Tuls

After watching Blow Out and seeing how passionate Jonathan was about his product, he sold me. Anyone who is that determined to make the best product on the market, obviously will do whatever it takes to make it happen.
After seeing how much the product was, I cringed at the fact that a bottle of shampoo would be that much. I later, literally dragged myself to Sephora to purchase this shampoo/conditioner after knowing that I was willing to take a risk that could eventually end up in my closet.
I bought it, went straight to my bathroom, and washed my hair. The shampoo did not lather, which I expected considering there is no harsh detergents or sodium lauryl sulfate. The conditioner was a very light, thin substance. Definitely not thick. 
Finale-Dried my hair, and right there, I knew that this product is definitely the BEST hair product BY FAR, that I have ever used. My hair, is very damaged, brittle and FULL of split ends. This product made my hair, very very full, FULL of shine, and very soft. My hair was beautiful for days....
Last test.. going to work. As soon as I put my hair down from a pony tail (I'm a waitress), INSTANTLY everyone noticed my hair. They asked "what did you do?? your hair is soo beautiful".. I told them "40 dollar shampoo and conditioner" WELL WORTH THE COST. Definitely a salon in a bottle. Now my worst fear is that it will be discontinued for any reason. And if so, I am willing spend 1k to stock up and save as much as I can. There is no other product like it

My hair will do anything I want with this shampoo and the volumizing conditioner, whether I'm in a dry climate or a humid one.  And the water in the city I'm in doesn't make a difference either.  I can't believe how great it is!!  It really is the best I've ever used

After reading the other reviews I was a little worried about using the product I had already ordered.  After using it for a few days now my hair has never looked better, I truly feel like this shampoo/conditioner was meant for me.  I have fine, super straight hair, middle to short.  It feels clean and sleek. The conditioner smells like pina coloda, yum!  I would definatly recommend this for my hair type.  Would maybe recommend to lather the shampoo in your hands first then work thoroughly( it doesn't lather as well as some shampoos that have lots of glycerine in them) and only apply the conditioner towards the end of your hair and leave in for a few min.  Hope that helps

I thought I was just going to have to put up with fly-away hair the rest of my life.  This product is not for baby fine hair that goes limp when anything touches it.  It's serious taming for seriously stubborn, coarse, or frizzy hair.  Mine falls into the first two categories.  Don't use too much!  I use it after I've dried some of the moisture out with light blow drying then gently sweep it through my hair - even combing it gently in to reach every strand.  For the first time in years my razor-cut layered hair is smooth

LIKE ANY OTHER LEAVE-in creme, conditioner, ANYTHING, if you PUT TOO MUCH OF IT ON, it WILL attract  DIRT.  I know this because I have baby fine hair and had to model in the DRY DRY deserts in the middle of summer.  Needed ANYTHING leave-in to keep my staticy hair down.  Yes, the more you use, to more dirty you get....  (but in photos you can't really see this, but it felt nasty!)    SO.  Wash your hair.   Well.  Condition.  Towel dry.  APPLY SPARINGLY.  Like a TOUCH.  And smooth into hair. It's not rocket science.  If you need a little more later, add a little more

He said, "Your skin looks really nice." And he never notices anything! I told him it was makeup since he actually bought it for me at my request and I wanted him to know it was money well spent. I like to use it in conjunction with Benefit's Dandelion powder for a fresh, natural glow. I really do feel younger and prettier with it on, and I can't say that about many/any other comsetics I've tried. Totally worth it

High Beam is a nice subtle highlighter. However, be sure to blend it very quickly and well or it will look unnatural in certain lighting (it'll look like you have pink nail polish on your face). It also has a tendency to emphasize pores. So only use it on areas of your face where you don't have any, like on the top of the cheek bone and under your eyebrows.

BeneFit's "supermodel in a bottle" lives up to the hype. You only have to use a tiny bit of this in key places to attract light and create an ethereal glow... this is the perfect little potion to use when you really want to make an impact. It is a pearlized light pink that blends easy, stays put and adds a little drama. One of my all-time beauty favorites

High Beam is really pretty!  I love using it as a highlighter on my "big night outs".  I swipe it on my nose to make my nose seem slimmer, right above my blush on my cheeks, and above my eyebrows near the arches.  It really gives my skin a dewy and glowing look. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's very goopy and sticky.  It actually scared me a bit to put it on my face because the product is so thick that if you turn the jar upside-down, it won't run!  But overall, I still think this is a terrific product

I have used a similar product in a compact by Chanel and paid $50. It wasn't too long before I saw the end of it either. Now with Benenfit's High Beam I can get the effect for less than half the price so I'm a happy customer. I put this on my cheek bone and brush blush over it for glimmery, dewy cheeks. It's a very youthful look. It's not unnatural but it's better than natural. It's supernatural. Since I started wearing it people don't know exactly what I've added but they comment that my skin looks particuliarly good. You can control the highlighting effect by how much you use but I like to use a generous amount. My skin really does beam.

Some highlights are the all day long hold, ease of use, resistance to moisture (rain won't ruin your hair), low shine, strong yet natural hold, and good smell (which is rare).

I am a professional hairstylist and use this iron...I think it works the best, leaves the hair shiny and soft, however I have no idea why the company would recommend using it on wet hair, unless you want to spend all day doing your hair!

This is by far the greatest thing I have ever seen.  I have struggled with curly/frizzy hair for 40 years.  I have tried all the serums, smoothers, and spent 30-40 minutes blowing out (15 with the iron once you get the feel for it), only to have it only last a day.  I use this with NO PRODUCT.  My hair is slick, smooth, silky (Jennifer Aniston-ish).  I put a bit of leave in conditioner just on the ends when I'm done.  Sleep on it, wake up ready to go...last several days.  P.S.  It's also muggy and humid here and it still looks great

I'll admit, with a well receded hair line I still tried to get what's left to be manageable and look good - everything else I've used left my hair dry, flaked off or didn't hold.  Jonathan Dirt has solved this long-term issue for me in just the first few days of use.  Dirt provides the manageability, hold and look I've strived for and even smells great with its almond scent.  I recommend this without reservation

I love this product!  My mother is a hair dresser so I have tried every product there is, and this one is my favorite.  If you use it properly then it's amazing.  It's a texturizing paste, not super glue, you can't expect amazing hold out of it.  And because it is a PASTE, it's extremely thick so you only need a tiny amount.  I have short, thin, wavy hair that I flat iron, and I just rub my fingers along the top of the paste to just get a thin layer on the tips of my fingers and apply it to my roots, it works amazing for volume, and I've never had a problem with it weighing my hair down or looking greasy!

Don't expect miracles from this product.  It does exactly what it claims to do!  Plus, it smells amazing!  Oh, and also...I am NOT in love with Jonathan nor his TV show, I bought this product before I had even heard of him or his TV show...I honestly find him a little annoying, but this product definitely isn't

Dirt has proven to be an amazing product...I'm "wowed" with how great it works!  I have a layered, razor cut that flips out and, before, was using three other products (pomade-for shine, manipulator-for flip, and aquage paste-for volume).  I just received Dirt last week, and after putting on just a bit, got the look that I was wanting, without all the hassle of three different products.  Yes, it's a bit pricey but well worth it (considering you only have to use a little, you're sure to save $$$).  and the smell, ::sigh:: is so great!  (Even if it hadn't worked as great as it does, I think I would still purchase it just for the delicious scent)  :)  I love that I can run my fingers through my hair and it's soft and manageable, even at the end of the day, and without the sticky "gunk" feel.  I definitely plan on purchasing other Jonathan Products

Awesome product.  As an old product used to use the slogan "a little dab'l do ya", it is true with this product.  Don't over do it or you'll have a greasy mess.  Start with a little and add more if you need to.  Always melt by rubbing hands together first.  Smells great too!  My only beef is the price.  Most of us aren't used to paying those Rodeo Drive prices, Jonathan.  $26 may not be a lot to you, but....  :)

Having wild and uncontrollable hair as a woman is a well-documented problem, but what about if you're a guy?  After years of using cheap gels that left flakey residues in my hair, and/or smelling feminine, I was introduced to American Crew in the little brown jar by a stylist.  I now swear by this stuff.  Even on my knappy head (I have very thick wavy, but not curly, hair) American Crew keeps my hair in place and natural-appearing without lookling like I'm using Brill's Cream.  A thick dime-sized dab is enough for keeping my short haired coiffure in place and de-poofed all day. The trick is to work it in while my hair is moist from the shower but not dripping wet. Yes, it costs way more than gels but it's worth every penny.  One 4 oz jar lasts me about 6 weeks. The other benefit to American Crew is the smell - my wife absolutely loves the way my hair smells

As a working mom in her mid-forties, I am ever hopeful when it comes to product claims of time savings and beauty enhancement.  And so, when I read about the T3 Tourmaline Ionic Hair Dryer, I just had to have one.  With a price tag of $200, I figured the claims just had to be true.

The T3 is a sleek, beautiful and lighweight hairdrying and styling tool.  With its ionic particle things, it sounds so scientific, too.  But does it do what it says it will do?

For me, it's hard to tell.  It does dry at least as fast as my old 1800 watt hair dryer but with seemingly less heat.  So arguably, it is faster.  Less heat also means less hair damage.  So arguably, that is a beauty enhancement.  Is my hair sleeker and shinier?  Again, hard to tell.  No one at the office the next day seemed to notice any change.

One thing that I do notice, however, is that I like the idea of using an ionic hair dryer.  For whatever reason, I do think it is good for my hair.  And I suppose that in and of itself is enough to make this purchase entirely worthwhile

I did not believe the hype but read the other reveiws.  I have long hair and it would normally take me 30 minutes to dry my hair with my $15 drug store purchased hair dryers...I was pretty much used to that.  Often times I would let my hair dry naturally rather than blow dry it because of the hassle and time - not because it looked better, it looked terrible.  This dryer dries my hair in 15 minutes (fully blown under and styled), on top of that my hair is shiny when it's done and not dry.  I just bought one for my mom and would recommend this blow dryer for anyone that normally spends more than 20 minutes drying their hair, you will absolutely cut the dry time 50%.  Great purchase!

I think that this product does what it promises to do.  It is a "freshen-up" mist.  I use it everymorning (I shower before bed) before I blowdry my hair and it creates volume and makes my hair look awesome!  It is only short of the full 5 stars because it does not last all day, but it is definitely good for a few hours.  Even after it wears off, my hair is not flat.  It still has enough texture that I can just put my hands through it to get the "messy" look.

I don't think that it smells bad.  The smell actually reminds me of some spa products taht I use

After reading the other reviews I was a little worried about using the product I had already ordered.  After using it for a few days now my hair has never looked better, I truly feel like this shampoo/conditioner was meant for me.  I have fine, super straight hair, middle to short.  It feels clean and sleek. The conditioner smells like pina coloda, yum!  I would definatly recommend this for my hair type.  Would maybe recommend to lather the shampoo in your hands first then work thoroughly( it doesn't lather as well as some shampoos that have lots of glycerine in them) and only apply the conditioner towards the end of your hair and leave in for a few min.  Hope that helps

I'm at an age where wrinkles develop and would be a very unhappy camper without this night cream. Fortunately I started using it a few years ago and have not noticed new wrinkles. Since I'm buying into all the hype about vitamin C, I choose this particular formula. Besides the documented benefit of vitamin C this cream is great in general. I love the consistancy, rich but not too rich. And I don't get blemishes from it even though it contains shea butter, which gives it a fantastic feel. It is packed with other great ingredients like vitamins A, E and K and anti-oxidants like grapeseed extract. There is another skin care company that bases its whole line on grapeseed extract alone. It has phospholipids which binds water to the skin. Also anti-inflammatories like extract of orange, geranium and lavander. There's been recent research by those such as Dr. Perricone, for example, about the damage inflammation does to the whole body, the skin included. It really leaves the skin feeling soft and hydrated. It's nice to wake up in the morning to treated skin. I try new brands a lot but based on its track record I'm staying faithful to this night cream. It works

I purchased these gloves not for moisturizing my hands, but to protect them when I'm driving or riding my bike in the sun. My main concern was that they would be heavy or clumsy, but they fit like a second skin, are lightweight, grip well, and are extremely comfortable. I wear them for hours at a time without noticing I have them on, so I imagine they would be easy to sleep in. They wash like a dream. Will definitely buy  more

I added this item to qualify a gift order for supersaver shipping.  I was hesitant to order a scented candle on line, but I am glad I did.  I sent a book and this candle to a friend who was going to visit her husband who had been completing a fellowship in another city.  She really liked the scent--orange blossom green fig.  (I went to the Mistral site to read more detailed descriptions of the scents.)  She also liked the screw-on cap, which she thought would make it very secure in transit.  I would order this again.

I purchased the Andis clipper and trimmer combo offering.  My primary need was for a cordless clipper and Andis appeared to be about the only one available that  Icould find.  The purchase was a bit pricy but I'm totally happy with how they function.  The products are quality made and handle very nicely.  There is more power provided when the clippers are plugged in, but for my needs, real close cut every 2-3 days, they work perfect.  I recharge my clippers once a week.  The instructions suggest that every 60 days you let the clippers run until the battery runs out.  I did this once, but got tired of waiting for the clippers to stop, so my impression is that I could probably go for 2 weeks between charging the battery.  Overall I consider them to be a very nice set of clippers/trimmers

Exuding citrusy aromas, the Still Life Bath Bomb smells GLORIOUS. Bath Bombs are made of sodium bicarbonate, so they're like "alka seltzers" for the bath.

Some of the LUSH Bath Bombs contain petals and other plant parts and Still Life is no exception. Mine was FILLED with sunflower petals--even a complete flower and a leaf! 

Although bathing with such Bath Bombs are luxurious, the clean up can be quite messy. (When my husband came into the bathroom while I was bathing, he exclaimed "What the heck is THAT?!" Why, it's sunflower petals, my dear...)

I had a first rate mess on my hands after the bath. I had to keep clearing the drain for the water to go down. THEN I had to do it a few more times before I could finally RINSE the tub!

If you don't mind the LUSH Bath Bombs that include petals and other flora and fauna--and you love bright, citrusy scents--you'll likely LOVE Still Life Bath Bomb. It smells heavenly, and tints the water with a golden hue.

However, if you don't like plant parts floating in your bath--nor the clean up involved afterwards--steer clear of Still Life

to the bareMinerals starter kit ! Cute little jars allow you to try the Bisque and Summer Bisque Multi Tasking Face, I use both shades for concealers on all areas of my face.  I take my time and apply a little then go back and apply more if needed.  Being able to apply after the foundation works very, very well.  All blend together, no tell tale signs of "concealer".  My under eye area looks more natural as well, covering the dark circles and veins.

The bare Radiance All Over Face Color has too much shimmer for me so I gave that to my daughter.  But the Glee is perfect.  I use this in place of the Warmth and am happier with the color.  Just a different tone to use, especially if you already have a red/ruddy complexion.

Faux Tan All Over Face Color is something I plan on using this summer, perhaps mixing with Glee for a sun kissed look.

The brushes included with the kits, really are Strokes of genius and worth every penny!  I find no comparison to any other brushes (Mary Kay, Estee Lauder etc) that I own.

I am so glad that Amazon and Sephora offer a wide variety of bareEscentuals products. [...]

I've looked at this makeup for the 2 years I have been a Mary Kay consultant and I cannot believe how I love it!!!  Moisturize is the most important thing for your skin but I love the skin care of the easiness that is involved in looking and feeling great!  It really does what it says!  I am adding to my collection of items to have what a beautiful woman needs in her collection

I love Bare Escentuals and the only reason I gave this product a 5 rather than a 5 is probably based on my application skills.

I have been using Strivectin for 2 1/2 years, faithfully every morning and evening.  The crease that was between my eyebrows is gone!  Also the "marionette" lines around my mouth have lessened quite a bit - also much less feathering of lipstick.  I only use it on my trouble spots, before applying moisturizer.  It's terrific.
And it lasts forever

Being a 55+ year old male, I decided that if it "works for women", then why not men? The product seems to work OK, but I think that I would probably need to use it a little longer, since I have only been using it for 3.5 months

There are so many products to choose from and I have tried many of them, most recently Rejuvinol and the other being AlphaDerma CE that just dried my skin and I ended up breaking out from them. It was horrible. someone at my office recommended Strivectin and I gave it a try. It not only completely cleared up my skin but got rid of my crows feet and forehead wrinkles. And to think, I've wasted soooooo much money on other products that didn't work!!

I'd like to start off by saying it's how it makes you feel and how long that feeling will last - not the person who put his/her name on it. Get over the hype and indulge yourself in this very pretty scent! It's truly a fun burst of many magnificent scents all blended together to form this cute, playful perfume. If you're looking for a light, flirtatious find - this is the perfume for you and I recommend it highly to the more than picky souls out there. My only concern is how long this lasts, as it tends to fade a little more than Britney's recent perfume, Fantasy - Otherwise, this will have your co-workers 'curious' as to what exactly you're sporting - It's definitetly worth it

When I first saw CURIOUS while on holiday, I bought it without trying any. I just wanted the pretty bottle. When I opened it up back home I didn't have high hopes, impulse buying rarely works out does it? So what did I think?

I love it. My first thought was; Sophisticated and classic. CURIOUS can be worn for work, shopping, evenings out - anywhere at any time! 

On the first spay you notice the top notes of magnolia and lotus flower, then the dreamy base of vanilla-infused musk, which lasts throughout the day. The best surprise of all?   After you've worn it for a few hours, you are surprised with the mouth-watering aroma of tangy pear.

All my life I looked for a liner that would last all day and not smudge.  I tried everything, from Chanel to Maybelline and nothing worked.  I don't like liquid liners because I find them hard to apply.  I found the answer to my problems with this gel eyeliner.  I found it much easier to apply than liquid eyeliner, and it lasts for ever!  I own it in 4 different colors and I don't think I'll ever stop using it.

This shaving cream was very enjoyable to use. You only need an amount the size of a nickel or quarter in your palm to get a good lather. I do not use the badger hair brush yet but my shave is very comfortable and it smells good. It also has made shaving a more enjoyable experience for me which is worth a few bucks right there ! I tried the T &amp; H West Indies Lime and the 1805 traveler size as well. The 1805 also smells good and the West Indies Lime had a bit of a musty, lime scent to it. You may want a more distinct lime scent but I have not tried any others with this smell.

I have been using soaps and creams for a few months now. I started to use soaps and creams mainly because they provide better value for the money and they help my sensitive skin.

I have always had sensitive skin and shaving never helped. I recently came across Truefitt &amp; Hill Trafalgar and figured that if it was good enough for royalty, then I should give it a try. I can definitely see why this is the official royal shaving cream. It wasn't until I tried this cream and combined it with a Merkur Futur double-edged razor and badger brush that I knew what it was to have a close shave with no razor burn.

Like the previous reviewer said, most people need to realize that very little goes a long way. With just a small dab on a wet badger brush you will be able to create a warm and thick lather that will make you love shaving.

Shaving the old fashioned way will take a bit longer, but it will feel luxurious and the results are much better than anything you can get with a Mach 3 and a can of gel. I can finally go a whole day without shaving. If I go two days, I have a nice 5 o'clock shadow around 8.

This is the best bet for a shave cream. It smells very good and provides more than enough lubrication for a razor to simply glide over. A badger brush is a must though. Truefitt &amp; Hill Trafalgar is simply fantastic.

I recently started wet shaving (within the last two months) and have come to regard shaving as something I look forward to now.  I use a Merkur Futura double-edged razor and have bought an assortment of different shaving creams to try, including Prorasso (italian eucalyptus stuff), Taylor of Bond Street (avocado) and the Truefitt &amp; Hill Traflagar.  My top choice is the Trufitt &amp; Hill hands down.

While many people might see the $22 as expensive, most people need to realize that a very little goes a long way.  This is not like the Edge Gel or Barbasol that you learned to shave with.  This just requires a dab on the wet brush (a real badger hair brush) and a swirl in a small bowl sitting in a a bit of hot drawn water to create a warm and thick lather that will make you enjoy shaving again.  I would estimate this jar will last about 6 months.

In looking at the cost of my new shave method (52 blades a year ($0.50 each), two jars of shaving cream a year ($22 each) comes to about $70 a year.  Compare this to a blade every other week and a can of alcohol-based shave gel (which dries your skin) every other month for a cost of $60.  Ten bucks more a year buys a much better shave.

I've noticed that my shaves take a bit longer, but my skin has cleared up of many of the bumps that I used to have.  I also no longer have a 5 o'clock shadow at 3 in the afternoon.  Best of all the shave is the closest thing I've ever had to the shave I got from a barber in Florence, Italy using a steady hand and a scary looking straight blade.

This is the best bet for a shave cream !

Surround yourself with the luscious, tangy, invigorating scent of grapefruit while you smooth and buff your skin. It's really a treat to shower with this. It's a bit thin to be extremely exfoliating but this may not be a drawback if you want something more gentle. It's almost juicy and it conditions and tones too. It's wonderful if you want to use it everyday. It's certainly the most pleasant to use of the scrubs I've tried

The best makeup is not French, but German, and the best German makeup is DR. HAUSCHKA.

The most important thing about this product is that it contains SAFE INGREDIENTS with little or no questionable or toxic material. You are putting makeup on your face and lips. Do you really know what most of it contains? Put your mind at ease with DR. HAUSCHKA.

I'm reviewing the powder, but this review applies to all products from this company

I have pretty oily skin and I break out frequently. I use it on the spot and it dries it up causing it to heal. It doesn't happen over night but there IS a difference. My sister also uses it for her teenage acne and finds it works by keeping the breakouts in check.

I have had ongoing clogged pores, and blackheads since February   of 2004, after being hospitalized for acute asthma and prior treatment including megadoses of Prednisone cortocosteroid, to diminish severe asthma .  However the huge doses of steroids destroyed my immune system and adrenal glands........resulting in hormonal cystic acne, blackheads and clogged pores for 2 years.  Was so depressed that I stopped going out, because of how badly my face looked.  However, after trying every product on the market to treat clogged pores and blackheads with results ranging from none to increasing the acne problem, making it worse than before....I begrudgingly tried one more product.......that being "On A Clear Day Blemish Serum".  Upon receiving it, I tried it for 10 days and achieved OUTSTANDNG results.  I have been using it ever since.  However, i DID have to reorder within 4 weeks; and i just received 6 bottles of it.  I cherish it.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

This stuff works but you have to be careful with it. If you have sensitive skin and a tendency toward OCD it can leave you with one heck of a chemical burn. It does work and work well, but be careful not to use it more than once a day until you figure out what it does on your skin

You can't go wrong with this kit, I have Skyscraper and Plum Chelsea.  Mally includes instructions on how to apply the shadows so there will be no fear when you try it out.

I love these sets.  It is so handy to have all the right colors in one spot, and not have to rummage around.  Great for travel and busy days.  I have the midtown merlot (which doesn't appear to be offered here yet), and skyscraper on its way.  It's nice to have a primer included to help keep the look longer.  The eyeliner is good too.  Follow Mally's directions and you really will have sexy smokey eyes.  I want all the colors!

I was a bit skeptical at first, using an overnight treatment; I didn't want anything heavy, and gooey on my hair and on my pillow, and possibly traveling to my face and making me break out. This proved to be totally opposite of my fears, it was light and milky, it sank right in and I didn't feel like I had anything on my hair at all. It was very soft right after I put it on, and it had no scent, I guess you don't want it to keep you up at night! Also this is not for everything use, the instructions say 2-3 days a week, so the bottle lasts for quite some time.

I have long hair that I dye and highlight whenever Im in the mood, and this product was just what I needed. I didn't want to chop my ends, and this did a great job of keeping split hairs at bay, and it left them very soft and well groomed. Sometimes hair that gets long has this "old broom" look on the bottom and this magic potion really made the ends silky and straight.

Expensive but a small amount goes for a long long time. If you want long, shiny and luscious hair, then this is a wonderful product to purchase. I don't regret having it at all!

I'm 26 and have used every brand of foundation in search of "THE ONE". When makeup is concerned, you truely get what you pay for. I've used foundations I liked, but never loved. I want a light non-sticky consistency, medium coverage, and a cream to powder finish that doesn't look chalky. This foundation meets and exceeds my expectations. It goes on with a featherlike weight and softness. It turns to a velvety powder that looks so soft and natural, its like the skin I had as a young child. It's not "your makeup looks great", its "your skin looks great". The name is not an overstatement in the least. As for the price, well worth it. How much money do most women spend during years worth of buying and trying out foundations? This is your foundation and powder all in one. A little goes a long way. I highly recommend it!!!!!

This is my first badger shaving brush, and I'm very satisfied with it. I don't know how it compares to the much more expensive brushes out there, but it's certainly a big improvement over the cheap bristle brush I was using in the past. I don't regret not spending more

  I feel for the other people who rated this product but I have the opposite reaction to this shampoo.  I love the smell...it's not the floral scents you get from other shampoos.  Instead the smell is a bit earthy...heck, it's made with nut oils.  As far as the quality of the shampoo...I'll use it forever.  I have fine hair, but a lot of it, and this shampoo ends up being perfect for my hair...detangles but still leaves my hair full and silky.  I can't say enough about it.  Please judge for yourselves...just try the 2 oz size and see what you think

This Spring, add some perkiness and sassiness to your everyday lifestyle without losing your elegance and charisma. Wear "Rock 'N' Rose" Eau de Parfum Spray by Valentino and be as perky and sassy as you can, but still remain elegant and charming as you are!

With its mixture of heady rose, sandalwood, blackcurrant and gardena, this beautiful scent is a knock out. I absolutely love its sweet smell and the staying power is simply amazing! Show off the "rocker" in you but still be as dainty as a pink rose with this "Rock 'N' Rose" perfume by Valentino.

So take a moment . . . and smell the roses!

This is one of Philosophy's 3-in-1 products.  It can be used as shampoo, bubble bath, and shower gel.  I've only used it as a shower gel, so that's all I'm able to review here.  As a shower gel, this product is exceptional.  It's an extremely rich and thick gel, and produces a generous lather with abundant bubbles.  I find it to be somewhat moisturizing- it doesn't explicitly moisturize my skin, but it also doesn't dry it out, even in the winter.  In addition, the gel is opaque and creamy, rather than clear, like most shower gel.  The melon daquiri scent is summery and fruity.  It's a pleasant sweet melons scent.  It doesn't smell especially alcoholic; though it's part of Philosophy's line of 3-in-1s meant to smell like fruity cocktails- like margaritas and pina coladas.  The scent is more fruity melon than alcoholic melon.  That said, people who like juicy, fruity scents will likely love this.  

While I haven't tried using this as a bubble bath or shampoo, the rich lather I get from the shower gel suggests to me that it would probably work very well as the other two parts of the 3-in-1.  The one thing that may be problematic for people- the scent doesn't last beyond the shower.  I can't smell it on my skin anymore when I get out of the shower, though the scent is quite strong while in use.  Some people may find that problematic.  I like that it doesn't clash with my perfume, so it's okay for me.

I use it every time I use make-up. (which isn't very often) but I just love it. It's easy to use and also looks great. Great if you're in a hurry. And plus, it's about a pen size, so you can even just put it in your pencil case. Or evening purse. :

It's been awhile since I bought myself some perfume, so I stood at the counter trying several perfumes. I had tried CK Summer 2006 earlier this year, but didn't get it.

Nothing I tried compared to it that day. So I bought the spray and shower gel.

This glorious perfume has hints of Tangerine, Pineapple, Grapefruit, Frangipani, Sea Breeze, Palm Sap, Driftwood. It's clean--very fresh smelling. I LOVE it! It's a very yummy scent.

If you like citrusy, clean scents, you'll love CK One Summer 2006. It stays on me all day, which is surprising. Usually scents--especially the clean ones I favor--fade as the day goes by.

This is a limited edition, and comes in the blue/green bottle. Don't pass it up!

This is truly the best in highlighting products and I have tried many high end and cheaper products out there.  This is so light and just doesn't get all cakey and greasy.  I have tried so many brands that claim to look natural, but they just don't.  This really does and don't let the price fool you either.  It only takes alittle and lasts a long time, so well worth the price for the look it gives.  I love this!

Okay, I love this!  I got it for Christmas as part of a gift set and I absolutely love it.  It's ideal for in your purse for use on the go...  And the lipgloss smells/tastes great!  And when it's on, it has tiny sparkles of purple that seem to come from nowhere and then disappear just as fast.  Love it!  It lasts a long time, too!

Highly recommended for fans of this perfume who also love a good lipgloss

...This a nice, fruity, sweet scent comprised of apple, peach, freesia &amp; mimosa, so this is best suited to daytime in spring/summer. It smells very similar to Ralph Lauren's `Ralph', so if you like that you'll like this too. 

On the minus side, this scent needs to be applied lightly to avoid headaches, it does get overpowering. (It loses a star for this).

Don't be put of by Paris' name on the bottle - try it!


Oh, the secret ingredient? Pheromones! Let me know if you have any look with it!!

Naturally I have dark brown hair, but I dye it blonde, so I have a lot of dead ends and stray-aways. When I first received this product, I put a little in my hands and rubbed it into my dry hair. At first, I think I put in a little too much, because it was a little greasy, but I was amazed at the results. It instantly flattened and smoothed my hair. The smell was kind of vasoline-like, but don't worry it goes away. If you have dry hair, I definitely recommend this product. I used to use a flat iron on my hair to keep the dead ends from rising, but now I don't even use my flat iron. I just blow dry my hair straight and put a little hair healthy butter on and I'm out the door! I LOVE this product

I've been hearing rave reviews for CD's products all over forums, and I purchased the 8oz. Healthy Hair Butter for my dry, breaking, relaxed hair from Sephora. It has the consistency of Vaseline and when I applied it to my dried hair after washing, it felt very stiff and heavy. It was hard to comb my hair even with my wide-toothed comb and for a few minutes I regretted getting it thinking it would stay like this. I tied my hair into a loose ponytail, and wrapped it with a satin scarf for 20 minutes. When I removed the scarf my hair was unbelievably SOFT and smooth! It felt incredible. It absorbed very well into the hair. I was able to comb through it easily. It felt silky but slightly greasy, but that may have been my fault for adding too much. This is an excellent all-natural conditioner and it smells fantastic. Like lemons and mint and garden fresh. The only issues I have with it are that it's very heavy, so on relaxed hair apply it sparingly, or it will get greasy and weighty. This will be great for controlling new growth. Next time I'll try applying it to wet hair. Overall great product

These shadows are great 4 a deep smoky eye look. The pictures make the colors appear lighter and brighter than they really are when U get them at home.

The application is smooth and blends great, which is perfect for a smoky eye

I used Proactiv and wasn't pleased; it is very drying. I have tried over the counter and they are harsh too. This is a great product. Can be pricey but it is so worth it. I am African-American and find it difficult to indentify products right for me. This is on the money!! I use the entire line

As soon as I started using this face wash, I started seeing results very quickly, and I have had adult acne for a long time.  This product keeps them away and I don't have any at all anymore.  My skin is smooth now, no blemishes, and I will not switch to any other products, this one is the best..hands down..and believe me...I'v tried them all!!  Thank you Murad!

I'm 28 and have always had what I would call average skin, the kind that most women have. I have normal skin with a little more oiliness in the T-Zone and I get blackheads and the occasional breakout. I have tried all kinds of different product lines (Urban Defense, DDF, Dior, Philosphy, Bliss, etc.) and am the happiest with the results I get from Murad. 
I have been using Murad for about 2 1/2 years now so I have tried a lot of the Murad products and found a routine that works great for me. 

In the morning I use the AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser (love it! the gritiness gives you very smooth surface for applying makeup) then the Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel and the Skin Perfecting Lotion which I mix and apply together so that I don't use as much. Last I put on my Moisture Silk Eye Gel and I'm ready to go.  

At night I use the Clarifying Cleanser followed by the Clarifying Toner, the Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel, the Perfecting Lotion and the best product of all the Night Reform Treatment (see my review of that product for details, I love it!) and again I use the Moisture Silk Eye Gel. 

Once a week I throw in the Exfoliating Fruit Enzyme Mask and I have perfect skin if I stick to the program everyday. My skin looks and feels better than it ever has and people always guess my age to be around 23 so it must be doing something right! 

Top 5 Favorite Murad Products:
1. Soothing Lip Therapy
2. Night Reform Treatment
3. Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel
4. AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser
5. Clarifying Cleanser

Murad Products that I don't like:
1. Day Reform Treatment (too greasy and I hate the smell)
2. Purifying Face Scrub 
3. The products for combination skin - they are ok but the acne line is so mild that people with combination skin will see better results using it. (I have used both product lines)

I've tried a full range of acne products from Proactiv to almost all of the drugstore brands, all of which have been disappointing.  Murad cleanser, however, is actually worth the money.  The cleanser imparts a tingly cooling sensation when used, a little goes a long way (need less than a dime size per use) and I saw clearer skin in less than 2 weeks.  I would recommend this product along with  Murad skin perfecting moisturizer to anyone.

I have tried other products such as ProActiv to help clear up my breakouts...and all have been harsh and may have helped clear my skin a little...but not enough for me to be 100% happy.  However, this product from Murad has completely cleared my skin and is so refreshing to my face.  Plus, I feel that you are definitely getting your money's worth -- this product last a lot longer than any other face wash.  I can't say enough good things about it...great smell, makes your face FEEL clean, ACTUALLY clears your skin, etc.  If you are looking for an alternative to ProActiv, try this.  It will probably take a week or two for you to see your face completely clear...but it will

I've recently started using Murad's Clarifying Cleanser as part of my daily routine and I'm very impressed with the results.  Not only does this cleanser smell fabulous, but it leaves my skin feeling clean and soft with no soapy residue left behind like some cleansers.  And I know that it's working because even after just 3 weeks, my adult acne is almost completely gone

I have combination skin and this has dramatically helped my acne breakouts.  It can be drying at first, but after a week of usage, my skin adjusted.  It's very important to use moisturizer as drying out your skin can also cause breakouts.  Use this and a murad moisturizer (with SPF) and I doubt that you'll be disappointed.

This is the perfect cleanser with my Clarisonic brush. You must use the two together for maximum benefits.. What is great about this cleanser, is that it is extremely gentle, and mild to the skin, yet the brush actions cleanse deep into the pores.

Ever since I started using my Clarisonic brushwith this cleanser, I constantly get compliments on my skin. I have recomeneded this product combination to all my friends and family

I have to admit I tried to find a cheaper sunscreen that does the same things this one does without irritating my skin, but I keep ending back on this one.  It's awesome.  It feels great on your skin, works great, and is so lightweight.  It is so easy to wear under makeup if necessary, and it leaves a flattering look to the skin.  When it first showed up I thought it was an awfully small amount, but then I realized it only takes a tiny, tiny amount to cover your whole face because it's water-light.  So it lasts (at least for me) at least a month with daily use.  In my opinion the only thing they could do to improve this product would be to make it sweat/water-proof, but then it might not feel as good to the skin as it does.  I can't find a better facial sunscreen for the money

I stopped using sunscreen on my face, except at the beach, because all the brands I tried were too oily and heavy, and the directions were to apply UNDER moisturizer and/or foundation. The result was a greasy, shiny face with clogged pores and frequent breakouts.  And then I received a sample of Clarins UV Plus SPF 40.  What a difference!!  Clarins UV Plus is a smooth, light lotion to be applied OVER moisturizer.  (I can't even tell I'm wearing it, except for excellent protection from all the sun's rays.)  Now I wouldn't be without it!  Although the price is $36+, you only have to use a tiny bit, and it lasts a long time.

This is my first Clarins product that I've ever used.  And I honestly am very impressed.  I've always been pretty anal about sunscreen and protection against harmful UV/UVB/Everything else rays.  I've always wanted products with the highest SPF available.  But the problem that I've always run into is that if you want a moisturizer with SPF included, it's usually on SPF 15 or 20...and that is simply not acceptable for me.

Higher SPFs always tended to be much heavier and oilier than I would like, and they caused me to break out frequently - Until Clarins UV Plus!  I am totally in love with this stuff!  It's a tiny tube that will literally last forever!  It has SPF 40 - which is enough protection from practically everything! It has anti-oxidants to fend off pollution.  What more could you ask for.  Yes, it is $35...but keep in mind that you will still need a separate moisturizer.  I use Hope in a Jar on freshly cleansed skin and then I apply my Clarins UV Plus, and I'm good to go.  

Protection is a must in today's world!  UVA/UVB/UV rays are going to bake your skin if you don't do something about it now.  If you're loking for a high quality, high protection product...Look no further

The wonderful thing about CITY Lips is that it really works! I fell in love with it the first time I used it, noticing a difference in the way my lips felt. They were extremely smooth, and unlike every other gloss I have tried, there was no sticky mess.  My lips have never felt so good, being completely hydrated and tremendously soft! I not only love the city lips, but the other city face products are wonderful as well

This product does work - and the night treatment brings out the natural color of my lips and gives a nice gloss. However, the price is just outrageous. $19 would be a more realistic price tag. Also, as anyone who uses a lipgloss that comes in a tube and is applied by a wand knows, the bulk of the product gets trapped up by the entrance of the tube where the wand cannot reach. On top of paying top dollar for this product, I can't reach about a quarter of it! CITY seems to have created a great lip plumping formula, but they need to bring the price down and/or redesign the package

After much scent testing was just thrilled to find this lovely, sweet fragrance! Cannot say I've had the same issues with staying power that a few others noted-- I find this scent quite detectable on my wrists and clothing even after an entire day out and about-- but, just chalk that up to the fact that everyone just has a different chemistry with a scent. I do agree that it is a "light" and subtle scent, certainly not meant to fill an entire room when you enter, but it is sexy, feminine and I've received many complimentary remarks on how pretty it smells. Absolutely love wearing it.

I agree with the previous reviewer, the smell has a candy like fragrance. I generally wear Oscar or Chloe, but this fragrance is a nice change. Doesn't have much staying power, though. It wears off fairly quickly. But it is a lovely scent.

LOVELY! LIGHT AND FRUITY SWEET. AN INNOCENT SCENT IF YOU WILL.  IT SMELLS LIKE COTTON CANDY. THE SCENT DOES NOT LAST VERY LONG AND I FIND THAT I USE IT SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE DAY. I WEAR IT ON DAYS WHEN I AM HOME OR ON WEEKENDS. IT IS MY SIGNATURE "MOMMY" SCENT.  MY KIDS LOVE IT.  
IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SOPHISTICATED SCENT, THIS IS NOT IT.  I RECOMMEND MICHAEL BY MICHAEL KORS IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SENSUAL AND SOPHISTICATED.

I was intrigued when I saw that amazon.com also sold body products such as perfume and make up.  How can you review a scent and convince people to purchase it?  I can't exactly post a scratch and sniff pad online.  I can say that this is one of my all time favorite perfumes.  It smells summery, light, fresh and refreshing, somewhat like Happy by Clinique.  The scent also lasts for a few hours, unlike some other cheaper perfumes.  Another bonus is that the packaging is beautiful: the perfume comes wrapped in a slender white box with a piece of rice paper that has describes flowers in a few different languages.

I absolutely love Clinique for eye shadow. All of their eye shadows go on so smooth, never crease, and are just the perfect shades of colors for my skin tone. The Almost Peach color is great because I can use it as a highlighter under my brow or just as a base, either way I use it just about every day!  :

I bought this product after first trying out Relastin's other product, Revitalizer.  I have really liked the Revitalizer, especially because it actually worked to firm up my skin and reduce my pores.  But I have different problems around my eye area like puffiness and I thought the Eye Silk could address that, which is normally hard to reduce.  So far, the results are good so I am happy with the Eye Silk.  This is worth trying

Pure Poison has a sensual and mysterious scent that is nothing short of invigorating.  But it's something I would only use during the colder seasons just because the weather brings out the scent more pleasantly.  For spring/summer, I would recommend Sunflowers by Elizabeth Arden.

I love this,so does my husband.I bought the entire kit which comes in a lovely satin mini duffel-like purse with a handle.it includes body creme,body wash,perfume.it has a bit of a strong introduction.it doesnt smell like pine-sol like others have said.Its like a re-vamping of the original POISON in the purple bottle.except this one has a sweeter and crisper tone.it becomes light and stays fresh with time.id say its a bit fruity/floral.Good for everyday or a special night out.

This is by far the best shaving product I have ever used. Yes, it is pricey, but if you can get past that, you won't be disappointed.

I hesitated to purchase this for months b/c of the price, but my friend gave me a sample to try-- I was hooked! It is decandent &amp; creamy, &amp; a little goes a long way. I also used to spend more money on expensive razors to get a closer shave; I now only use the cheapie razors &amp; my legs are so much smoother than before! I also use this under my arms &amp; have NO irritation (this was another hesitation, as I have very sensative skin). 

The fragrance is amazing as well. Sweet, as in the name, but not overpowering. This works very well as a layering to Benefit's other scented products, or their Maybe Baby fragrance, as they all smell similar enough to compliment one another.

The first time I used this, it was purchased for me as a gift.  It took me a couple of times to get the hang of it after using other foams and gels, but once I did, I was addicted.

Then I had to buy my own.  Just about fell over at the price.  It works great and I haven't had a nick or touch of razorburn since using it, but when I can go to another store and buy another product to shave with for 1/4 the price, I sometimes ask myself if it's worth it.  I just use it lightly and make it last as long as I can

Like others, I was skeptical about a shampoo bar. I really,really like this bar. It has a great scent. The first time I used it, the smell stayed in my hair most of the day, and now it lasts a few hours. Its a pretty deep cleanse, so I really only use it when I've been at bars or when my hair is full of product. I use it about twice a week or so. It has a really great lather. My boyfriend even uses it, since the smell isn't floral, but rather spicy in nature. The little cinnamon sticks fall out after a while, but the bar itself has held. I will definitely buy again. If you have dry hair, you should probably use this sparingly, as your hair will be 'squeaky' clean, or just make sure to follow-up with a good conditioner

I am on my second bar of this stuff now and, wow-there's so much I can say about it!  First the smell in honestly awesome and second, after only a week of use, I got all of these "baby" hairs cropping out over my head-this is awesome to me since, though I'm not currently loosing my hair, I have a strong family history of hair loss!  I also have VERY oily hair-the kind of hair that needs washed EVERY DAY or I look like I'm homeless but after using this shampoo I can skip a day and-for the first time in my life-you can't tell it my the condition of my hair!!  My only issue with this is that even though my scalp is oily, my ends are dry and I have to use just a tiny bit of cream conditioner along with it-also this item dissolves SUPER quick if you leave it in the shower and makes everything in your shower pink...but other than that I strongly recommend this item to anyone curious

This product is wonderful. I have extremely thick and unruly hair which always needs to be conditioned in order to get a brush through it. It's also started falling out by the handfuls since the birth of my daughter (an iron deficiency may be the culprit). This solid shampoo bar leaves my hair soft and shiny, and I DON'T need a conditioner. It lathers up wonderfully, too. So far, I've also noticed that hairs don't come away when I run my fingers through it, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that NEW! will help me to combat the hair loss. And, lastly, LUSH sent me a tin to keep it in, which I thought was pretty cool.

I was totally skeptical about purchasing a solid shampoo. I was also completely NEW to LUSH products in general. WOW, was I surprised when I used this little bar! At first I was surprised at how small the bar itself is. I thought it wouldn't last a few washes...but it's absolutly amazing! I am a male and all I need to do is rub this bar on my head twice and my head is full of rich, thick suds! The lathering is amazing!!! There really are NO WORDS to describe how amazingly well this lathers. The scent is DELICIOUS! I love the cinnamon, spicey, almost "holiday" type scent. It is very pleasant and refreshing at the same time. I don't know how well this shampoo is for actually moisturizing (I have dry hair and my hair has pretty much stayed the same texture-so I can't say that this softens very well) but the scent and lathering-action alone were well worth the price for me. I can't wait to try more products from Lush

I have used many Lush products and some I love, some I HATE!  This one definitely falls in the LOVE category.  I have thick, medium texture, color-treated, slightly wavy hair.  This stuff works!!  I use it every other wash to remove all the residue from salon shampoos, conditioners, and products.  It makes my hair so shiny.  It lasts forever, about 3 months using it every other day.  Be sure to store it where it will not get wet - I use disposable gladware.  And, I haven't even gotten to the best part.  The smell is refreshing - mostly cinnamon and it makes your scalp tingle just a bit.  Can't say enough about this one!

This is a good product to use in the shower when you want to scrub on your cellulite.  It feels good and does not hurt to rub.  I don't think I use it enough to see if it makes a big difference but I'd like to think it does.  It does get the circulation going.  I like this product and will continue to use it.

This scent is a bit softer than many men's fragrances. It's a unique powdery scent. I like how it is not too strong and overbearing on one spray. Just enough so my girl can smell it when she hugs me or sits next to me. I also use Acqua di Gio and it is a good contrast to this scent. I get compliments for both scents

I love the smell of Philosophy Pure Grace. The shampoo/shower gel smells just as clean and fresh as the perfume. It's not too drying either

Of all the Philosophy line, I find that this is the best consistency-wise.  It's much thicker than the Amazing or Baby Grace gels, and leaves your hair and skin much softer, and smelling like Ivory soap.  Very clean scented, not too girly.

I really really love this product. It is the first rub in moisturizer I have ever used that smooths in evenly without leaving a sticky, slick feeling all over my hands. I think it actually has helped my cuticles as well.. But, it works wonderfully on frizz and damaged ends. It really seems to smooth and repair them

I have fine hair, and this did nothing to make my hair oily or weigh it down. It helped emphasize my natural wave and eliminated the need to heat-style. Plus, no frizzies! One thing to keep in mind: This is a PRE shampoo treatment, so make sure you use it before you shower and then wash it out. Your hair shouldn't get too greasy if you wash it out. You can also warm a little in your hands and pull through your ends as a hydrating styling product. The smell is a little "unique," not bad exactly, but you can always wash it out with your favorite-smelling shampoo. However, the whole line by Ojon is good, so I'd recommend the shampoo, conditioner, and styling cream too.

I've read the reviews, and it seems that only people with thick, coarse hair think this is right for them. Well, I have very fine hair that is chemically processed, and I've tried literally every product on the market. This makes my hair extremely soft and FULL! So far I've only used the restorative treatment, but after seeing the amazing results it gives, I'm ready to try the whole line.

It smells to me like mocha coffee, and I absolutely LOVE the smell, when I'm using it I run my hands through my hair and sniff them constantly - my husband laughs at me. I do think it's an earthy smell that some people would not like, though. It's kind of like patchouli, you either love it or hate it.

I know the price tag is a bit daunting - but a little does go a long way, so it lasts forever. And it's helping a tribe in Central America to thrive - that helps you feel a little better about spending the money.

I read the reviews of this product, and decided to go for it.  I love the smell (although it is a distinctive scent and it may not be for everyone), and it does make my hair really soft.  However, I have semi-fine hair, and it made my hair really oily-looking, even though I used a tiny amount.  I think people with thicker hair may benefit more from this hair treatment.  It reminds me of glorified coco butter with just a few more ingredients (and coco butter is way cheaper). 

I will use Ojon Restorative Hair Treatment again, but probably only on the weekends when I'm not going to work (because of the oily look).  

The bottom line is, definately smell it first to make sure you like it!  They sell it at Pure Beauty stores, among other places.  And, if you can try it somewhere before you buy it, do it!  Make sure it doesn't give you the "oily" look

i'm a true product junkie. i've tried more crap and spent more money on stuff for my colored, processed, blow dried, ironed, wavy damaged weak hair then any sane human being would...but i think i finally found my soulmate of a product...

first i must say it smells divine like mocha coffee...

i use this product daily before bed every night and in the morning after i towel dry my hair..it is the ONLY product i leave in my hair after shower whether i wear it naturally wavy or blow dry it straight...sometimes i will add the ojon gloss serum if i feel my hair needs it...

a little goes a long way, my past bottom of bra thick hair uses about the size of a tablespoon...

since using this product 2 weeks my hair is significantly shinier, softer, way less frizz, no more puff and not as porous.my color also looks more vibrant which is great b/c it's blonde and was getting brassy. and i noticed results right after the 1st treatment.

i especially love that it's good for your hair and the purchase contributions helps the tribe in central america who gather the oil from their trees. =)


it is pricey but worth every cent and then some. you can't put a price of true beauty right

I brought the kit which included both the ultra hydrating shampoo and conditioner as well as the hair treatment from QVC.  First of all, lets talk about the smell.  Yes there is a smell but it's not really that bad, honestly.  It has a slight coffee smell, but since I used the hair treatment as a pre-shampoo treatment, the smell wasn't really worth complaining about because it's not noticable after you shampoo.  Second, the hair treatment is absolutely great for hair that has been in braided styles for extended periods of time or has just been mistreated and needs a little TLC.  It restores moisture and elasticity to my starving hair.  I don't have course or very kinky hair, but it is very thick and this stuff works very well with my thick hair.  It also moisturizes the scalp, which I love.  The only thing I'd want to change is the price, wish it was a little cheaper, but because it's not, I guess I value it all the more

Ok, this stuff is a bit like putting grease in your hair, but you use no more than a rice-sized amount and it will add shine and make your hair feel more healthy (and it may actually be!). I find the more I use it, the better my hair seems. It does have a slight odor similar to coffee beans, but I like that smell so it doesn't bother me. If your hair is dry or over-processed this stuff is for you -  but if your hair is just very fine and limp, I don't think this product would be for you

I have been hooked on this foundation since I found it at the Bloomdale's counter in NYC in 2002. I have oily complexion and this keeps my face not just looking but also feeling fresh and wonderful.I have skin issues but with this foundation as an example this morning all men see is a WOW face. My shade is definitely Honey, find your perfect shade/color match and you too will fall in love with Bobbi Brown Foundation. I refuse to use anything else, why mess with WOW

Every other foundation I've tried has had some ashy undertone, no matter what color I tried, and even when the color itself was right. This one was the exceptation. They seemed to have got the undertone thing right. I got great coverage, and at the same time managed to have it looking natural. It's oil free, but not chalky: think dewy, not greasy, which I appreciate as a person with oily skin. My skin looked like it was naturally near-flawless and even, but it also lookked like I was wearing little to no foundation. I hear it's buildable though, so someone who likes cake-face makeup could have that with it

"Holly, you smell like roses!" is what I hear anytime someone comes near me. And its all thanks to this little bottle of wonders. Normally fragrance gives me severe hives, but not this. I am beautifully scented and hive free. AND it DOESN'T smell like old lady Big Lots perfume. It smells like actual roses. I once compared it to a real rose and the smells were identical. I am a teen and am constantly complimented on this scent by my peers. I even put a little in my hair to help smooth split ends. A wonderul product, deserving of 10 stars

I gave this four stars because of the price and because I bought a concealer brush for the cream and have since found my finger does the trick nicely!
Aside from that, the effect of looking at your face in the mirror without any darkness under your eyes leaves you a little shocked at first...there is something wrong!  Until you realise that you just look really...fresh. There is no other word. You look like you've had a great nights' sleep and your whole face seems brighter because of it. Although it is a little on the pricey side..bear in mind you really don't need to use that much of it..the powder is great to matte everything out and the little mirror inside the lid is so helpful too! I know this is a great investment as everyone needs to conceal the stress, bad sleep and lifestyle from under their eyes! Bobby Brown is an expert at creating natural looking makeup that makes you look like the best version of yourself

All i can say is this product is great, because of my Indian Heritage, i got the dark circle around my eyes and after the baby my dark cirlce got worse. I looked so tired and older with the dark cirlces. I bough a lot of products to cover my undereye dark circles, but i was not happy at all. I was keep trying new concealers but no satisfaction at all.  One day i went to a store they sell Bobbi products, and i was just looking for a powder that matched my skin tone from bobbi brown. They got me the right powder color and she asked me to try out some of the Bobbi Brown Creamy Concealer for my dark cirlces. I was not sure but i let her try it on me. I was so happy to see my dark circles gone. And i keep getting compliments how fresh i look and makes me feel pretty. Since than its my all time favourite. A little goes a long way. And i think its great for people with serious dark circles. I got a little kit with a small mirror, included with  a yellow based concealer and a a little darker creamy concealer to even out the yellow concealer with your skin color and a yellow powder for the finishing touch.
You just have to get the right color of concealer for your skin complexion. 
Its a little expensive for that small kit but i love it its the money worth

I received Lancome Le Stylo Waterproof Long Lasting Eyeliner as a gift from my best friend on my last birthday. Since we are both in love with make up, she knew what to get. I fell in love with this eyeliner because it was smooth and easy to apply and it looked great. It works very well and very long lasting. They have different color and all of them are pretty. Even though, Lancome is a pretty pricey brand, the product pays for it.

I absolutely love Clinique for eye shadow. All of their eye shadows go on so smooth, never crease, and are just the perfect shades of colors for my skin tone. The Almost Peach color is great because I can use it as a highlighter under my brow or just as a base, either way I use it just about every day!  :

And then some....

I try to take good care of my skin and have tried just about every "fine line" or general facial moisturizing cream available over the years.  

I purchased some makeup recently from Sephora.com and got a free sample of the Kinerase cream and decided to try it.  Within two days (no kidding) I noticed a difference in my skin tone.  I began to notice a more "fresh" look - rosy, if you will.  I had some light freckles as well, which started getting even lighter.  

I decided right then and there to get some of this cream, as I was quickly running out of the small free sample.  That was when I learned how expensive it is.  :-(  However, I decided that since this has made more of a difference in my skin in just DAYS that I would bite the bullet and spend the money.

I can't tell yet whether it's really helping some of the fine lines I have, but just based on what it's done for my skin tone and color -- I can honestly say it's worth every single penny.  Until they come out with a cream that can perfect skin tone in a day I'm sticking with this stuff....and singing it's praises

Within two days of using this cream, I waa astonished at the results!  My skin tone completely evened out, and my skin appeared smoother than it ever has in my life.  And it does add a glow.  I'm not so sure tha it really works on eliminating wrinkles, but the other effects are well worth every penny

I wish I could agree with the PP, but I still have a problem with feathering and I have tried everything. This product works very well. I can wear the sheerest of lip glosses and it stays within my lip line. With dark colors, I no longer have to worry about the feathering that always occurs this keeps lip color inside your lipline. This also works nice as an eyebrow wax

I am so glad that I purchased this cologne from Amazon for a Christmas gift.  I also had it shipped directly to the home where the gift was going to be opened.  This was a good thing, since MY home was burglarized 4 days before Christmas and they stole all of our gifts. If this one had been under my tree, it would have been gone.  The convenience of ordering online and shipping to the person is wonderful

This shower gel works really well--you can use it as a general soap, and it's very mild, so you can use it anywhere (ah hem..) on your body without it stinging, or burning. I haven't tried it as a shampoo. Works quite well for shaving. Good consistency. Smells exactly like fresh banana. More of a fruity banana scent, like a tropical lifesaver, than a baked banana bread scent, if that helps any. Pricewise, this is actually one of the more affordable upscale shower gels per ounce, assuming you buy the large bottle of just one scent. Also, this stuff preserves very well. I still have some Philosophy eggnogg (!) shower gel that I bought for the holidays, and I have now used it through 2 Christmases and it still smells great..

I admit: slathering on hand cream and putting on a pair of gloves is my Sunday morning indulgence. Usually, plain cotton gloves have done the job just fine. The first time I tried these,though, I noticed the difference immediately. The fabric seals in moisture and you get the pleasant sensation of your hands being lightly massaged.
When I took off the gloves, my hands looked and felt incredibly soft and supple. If you have very dry hands, these would be great if you wore them overnight.
They're very cheap too. A really worthwhile investment and highly recommended

For a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is MAC. Lipglass feels good on your lips, as if it contained some emollients. And (this is a big AND) it's not tacky or sticky. 

The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. 

Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. 

Enjoy!

MAC LipGlass is the absolute best. There are plenty of colors to choose from, SUPER-Shiny, and the gloss is thick, stays on and doesn't run. 
The best colors are....
NICO for a cute lavender pink color with a glittery shine. 
OYSTERGIRL is a shimmery baby pink.
OH BABY is the perfect gloss for any earth toned lipstick.
CHAI looks amazing with black smokey eyes. It's the perfect neutral earthy gloss and has no glitter or shimmer - just pure shine

I'm REALLY anal about scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored with vanilla, but MAC LipGlass isn't that vanilla-ish at all!  It's got very pigmented color, it stays on a LONG time for a gloss, and each tube lasts a long time...  Don't let what the other reviewer said about the vanilla scent throw you off

This is the toner that won't dry out my skin.

I bought the whole set and I have combination dry skin. 

The first day I thought it was strong. Second day, I can see on the cotton pad my black head on my nose. It worked! 

Along with the other 2 products, this toner made my skin glow in just a week.  My skin looked very healthy and beautiful. 

For people that have problems with this toner, don't use it during winter time. I avoid toner in general during winter time since I know my skin is already too dry. All I use is the mild cleanser and lotion. For Spring and summer, I use the whole set.

With Clinique products, the key is knowing your skin type. I took the quiz at [...] in order to decide which products to buy for the 3step system and the results showed Clarifying Lotion #2 as the appropriate option. I was a little worried when I read reviews on Amazon.com that said it was too strong and had given some individuals rashes, but I used it anyway. It works beautifully. If you buy this lotion and get a rash or breakout it's because you didn't consult with a clinique source or are unaware of your true skin type. So long as you buy the right products for you, it's going to do everything it promises and more...I highly recommend it

Clinique Clarifying Lotion is Step #2 in their 3-step skin care system.  (You start with their soap, and then follow the lotion with the Dramatically Different Moisturizer).  What I love about this one, made for larger pores, is that really effectively exfoliates and resurfaces your skin without stripping it of its natural oils too much.  You really feel it working, to pull out the impurities.  Well worth the investment....

I've been using this product, along with the mild facial soap and dramatically different moisturizer, for fourteen years now. I remember my consultation with the Clinique rep like it was yesterday. And therein lies the rub--if you've never used these products and are considering doing so, it is best to visit a Clinique representative to help you decide which products are best for your skin. A lot of times, people do not know what skin type they have or think they have one when it's really another. If you're not using the right ones for your skin type, you won't get the results you need. The Clinique reps can help. Talk to them first and then you can purchase anywhere!

I myself have the combination skin. The Clinique rep warned me that I might have some initial blemishes, and I did, but they tapered off after a week or so. Just out of the shower, or after a long day of who knows what may have gotten on your skin, this is an uplifting, cooling-when-it's-hot, breath of fresh zinginess. Often one all over swipe with this on a cotton ball is not enough--so use the other side of the puff, dab on more clarifying lotion and apply again, and maybe more with another cotton ball till it no longer turns any shade. This is worth it. You are taking off not only the makeup that the facial soap may not have caught, but any impurities that daily activity can attract to the skin--dirty fingers unconciously rubbed over the neck or cheek, etc. Follow up with the Clinique moisturizer that's right for you and your skin will feel five times lighter. Your skin is important. These products have helped mine stay in amazing shape over the years

I know that this is for reviews about clarifying lotion 2 but I thought that I would let people know about a new product Clarifying moisture lotion 2.

I have dry, sensitive skin and when assessed by the girls at the clinique counter I came out as a skin type I/II.  I use the extra mild facial soap, the clarifying moisture lotion 2 and the dramatically different moisturising lotion.  

When I looked at the reviews here on amazon I was suprised to find so many people were unhappy with the product, but I happened to go to the clinique counter the other day and found that in Australia there are two ranges of clarifying lotions, the original, which was what everyone was talking about, and the new moisture lotions.  According to the sales assistants the new moisture lotion was developed for the asian market and is alcohol free and being in the asian region Australia luckily gets both.

They exfoliate like the regular lotions but there is no sting or tingle and the skin feels really soft.  My face feels like polished marble at the moment and my makeup is going on and staying much better than before. I can tell you that my skin has never looked better since starting on Clinique and I would recomend this skin care line to anyone.

I have used this skin care system for the past 3 years without any issues. This works perfectly with my combination skin making it seem just like "normal" skin.

Additionally, my breakouts have been reduced to virtually nothing (like one pimple every 3 months compared to several breakouts a month). 

If you have never used these products you would benefit from going to the mall and having one of the consultants explain the product usage

I love this scent, I got it when it first came out in 2004, they gave away samples in the Macy's Impulse show and it has become my signature scent since then.  I receive lots of complements from everyone in the office since it really works with my body chemistry.  I work in a department mostly populated by men and they all tell me that this is the first perfume that does not irritate them.  Go out and try this scent.  It changes with time, to become a bit floral after a few hours, but my body chemistry can maintain the crisp, fresh, apple scent so it really works for me.  I love it

True or False?

1.	Beauty is only skin deep (read: physical beauty is superficial). 
2.	Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder (read: everyone is beautiful).

If anything my decade and half long stint as stylist and fashion editor has taught me, it is that a) physical beauty might be skin deep but its creation and maintenance is as complex a task as coming up with the theory of relativity b) beauty never lies in the eyes of the beholder...all beauty is about tricking the beholder to feel in a certain kind of way.

So banish all your old worn out mantras about beauty and adopt a new one. Beauty is hard work and Beauty is savvy. The Body Shop Skin Focus Face Illuminator passes both these litmus tests. For starters you are going to save a cool 14 bucks when you add this petite tube to your arsenal and before you scream, "what about quality?" let me assure you that a few dabs of this booster boy at the beginning or the end of your day (remember to wash and pat dry your face though) and your face will glow with that fresh faced allure that you last saw only in the black and white scrap books of your grandma.

p.s: Everyone is not born beautiful. I have seen enough. I know. You have to work at it.

p.p.s.:  And if it lightens your conscience any, the delightful gunk in this tiny tube has not been tried out on animals before. You'll be the first person to get a rash. Just kidding!

 I am a hairstylist &amp; I'm starting to do wedding make-up as well for some of my clients.  I am a firm believer in having high quality tools.  This set does not disappoint.  I achieved professional results from the get go with these.  I love them.  The bristles are soft &amp; the handles are just right.  These brushes will last a lifetime.

The price of this shave brush may seem high, but after shopping around, I found it to be fair. The quality of the brush is great. It is more modern looking than most others on the market without going overboard on the stainless steel. I use this shave brush daily with shave cream from the body shop

They put the lip gloss in a key chain. Its convenient to have with you on your keys so you can do a touch up anytime or moisturize your lips. Good quality, good product, nice lip gloss. Overall 3.5 stars.

It is probably smaller than a one inch cube so it isn't a whole lot of gloss, but is a key chain so it can't be too big. Very cute

At first glance this product may seem too intense to wear during the daytime but let me persuade you otherwise.  By using the suggested brush the unique texture that is a slight dry gel provides eye definition without looking nightclub ready at 9 am.  However, when you're ready to rock 'n roll this product can go on thicker and smudged creates a perfect smoky eye.  Additionally it stays on until removed and does not flake or smudge once dry.  The pot it comes in is quite large and deep so the purchase price actually is not excessive.  Great product from a dependable favorite line.

        These eye liners have a creamy, soft  texture that results in a satiny matte finish.  The texture makes them easy to apply (no liquid drops on cheeks) for either a classic thin line or a smudged smoky effect.

	Two shades are available - Black and Indigo.  The Black is jet, a true black, and the Indigo merits its name as it is a deep, deep blue that looks stunning on any eye color.

	Best part is that the color lasts all day and into evening without fading or running.  It can be used either wet or dry depending on the effect you want.  And, of course, they both come in Mercier's trim mirrored signature compact.

	Hint: Apply a line just above the upper lash roots to make lashes look fuller and thicker.  Amazing

I was looking for a summer scent.  This is the perfect summer scent.  It's refreshing, feminine and has a clean scent!  Definitlely, not overpowering for a hot summer day.  I allowed my friend to borrow my bottle for her wedding and she received many compliments during the day..both from her new husband and many of her guests!  This is definitely a great buy for the summer.  As far as it staying on, I beleive it last for quite a while.  Just when I think it's disappeared, someone ask me what I am wearing...you won't regret the purchase

This is a classic fragrance, not your overpowering J-Lo, B'Spears, etc.  I wish I could explain the scent...but it is tough to describe.  It isn't fruity or flowery.  Perhaps a bit of lavendar though?  Basically, you don't overpower a room with it.  It has a bit of an "old-world"-ness to it...but as far as I am concerned, that is a wonderful thing.  I am a 31 year old professional, I wear it daily and out at night, and I just love it

I recieved this perfume for Christmas from my husband. I love it. I am very picky about scents - I actually didn't have any until I recieved this one. I had given all the others away for being too strong, too flowery, too sweet, etc.

I love this scent. It is subtle and not overwhelming. So, I thought I would write a review to let people know that, while others may not like it, I do

After seeing SJP promote her new fragrance on Oprah, I had to smell it for myself! I got my chance in a magazine, and boy did I love it! I had hoped to get it as a gift, because it seems a bit pricey to me. However, I didn't get it. Still not sure if I want to spend the money on it, but I do love the scent

      Is there anyone who doesn't know the name Sarah Jessica Parker?  Okay.  Think "Carrie" on TV's enormously successful "Sex and the City."  She was the gal who dressed to the nines - always with style and glamour.  She brings both of those qualities to her first fragrance, "Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker."

	It's a unique, almost indescribable blend of classicism, chic, and innocence.  There's not a scent like it with top notes of fresh Mandarin, Bergamot, Lavender, and Apple Martini. Vibrant and warm it's  a fragrance that caresses the senses.

	Middles notes are Patchouli, tender Paper Whites, and luxe Orchid.  These are enhanced by bottom notes of irresistible white amber, sensuous cedar, and the very sultry musk.  This is a scent I revel in, and  enjoy wearing.

	The bottle is, of course, simple and exquisite, curved with polished glass, ultra feminine.

	Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker is a beautiful, dreamy yet quite alive fragrance appropriate for every occasion

I bought this product three weeks ago and I have seen great improvements on my skin already.  I have never really used skin products but I have been living in Florida for over 20 years I have a lot of spots due to sun damage.  A friend of mine told me about this product that his wife bought for him.  So, I decided to give it a try and it has really shown great results! The spots on my skin are diminishing and my face looks better. I have decided to try some of the other Menscience products. My wife also started using the product, so you may have to buy two

This eyeliner works as described. I would give it 5-stars except I'm not a big fan of liquid eyeliners that use a brush. It can be too hard to control the applicator, especially if you want to apply under the lower lashes. Since this is a brush on liquid eyeliner, it can't easily be smudged for a smoky look. Of course, the fact that it can't be smudged, once it is dried, is the whole point of this product. It can be cleaned up before it dries, but once it sets, it will stay there until you take it off. When you want to take it off, it comes off very easily, and cleanly, and really doesn't require anything but plain water to remove. I've found that very helpful when I travel. I also have sensitive eyes, but this product has not bothered me at all, probably because it doesn't flake or transfer into my eyes.  If there was just some way to get this product in a "marker" style, and a few more colors, I would be in heaven, even with the high price

I tried this at the LUSH store in Bellevue, I didn't like how it felt at first because it felt greasy to me but I soon realized I had used too much, it doesn't take much.

I got a free sample after purchasing other products there and my skin has been very dry because I am on a diuretic, this is helping my hands a bunch and I was suprised because I had a small cut on my finger that the skin was drying out around and it was catching on my clothes and other things. Within two days of useing the product the dry skin cleared up and the cut healed with almost no mark at all!

I love the mild, clean smell and soft feel

I've a mild case of eczema, so am also always keeping an eye out for products that can help my skin, without resorting to cortizone creams... I've had some success in the past with using straight jojoba and coconut oil on the eczema patches - but not enough to keep up with the hassle of oily spots of skin. I even tried making my own recipes - to some success. But, it was time consuming and I just don't have the time to mess around with kitchen cosmetics for a hobby.
After looking at the reviews for various types of lotions/creams in the Lush line, I decided to give this one a go. I've only been using it for a couple of days, but already my skin is less irritated, and the scaliness seems to be diminishing some. (eczema strikes the top of my feet and a bit of the ankle... makes wearing combat boots a bit annoying when its acting up)
I'll probably need another week or two of steady use to really know if it works as I'm hoping, but so far so good...
There's no real strong scent to the lotion - so it shouldn't bother those who are sensitive to smells. So also pretty cool on that end as well :-)
Works great on the rest of my skin as well!! No more dryness from the winter weather anymore

HI

I initially bought LUSH's Dream Cream because I recently started to wax my arms and I wanted something to help soothe and minimize any irritated skin.  The wax kit did come with `Soothing Oil' that is suppose to help, but it's too oily to leave on the skin.

I've been a LUSH fan for a while, and the sales person led me to Dream Cream.  It has really soothing ingredients, like oat milk, olive oil, chamomile, and tea tree oil, so I took a sample home.

I just waxed tonight and put Dream Cream on after.  What a HUGE difference.  There was very minimal redness and no irritated bumps.  I usually get these mosquito-like bumps whenever I wax, but I didn't get any.  The next morning, I couldn't even tell I just waxed my arms because my skin was so "normal".

Dream Cream also works great to cut down on red bumps after shaving, and as a soothing lotion for itchy skin.  I will be getting more to use after waxing and shaving.  Definitely worth trying.  It's not LUSH's best selling lotion for no reason

I was browsing a Lush Newsletter and read that Dream Cream had been used to alleviate the horribly painful dry skin that accompanies cancer patient's skin during the course of chemotherapy.  Since a family member was undergoing both chemotherapy and radiation therapy, I thought I would buy a tub and see if it did indeed relieve the horrid eczema-like patches of skin covering her body. I figured we had nothing to lose; we had tried everything else and had not found anything that worked yet. Being eternal skeptics, I have to say that we were both pleasantly surprised at how well it worked. It immediately relived the burning and itching that often accompanies dry skin. It took a couple of days of liberally applying the lotion 2-4 times a day for the swelling and redness to diminish, but it did finally disappear. I think if you have standard dry skin, applying it this often might make you feel a bit on the greasy side.  I found that it if you have particularly painful dry skin, it helps to keep the tub of Dream Cream in the refrigerator. The coolness of the lotion further augments the relieving properties of the essential oils in the cream. 
	
I would have to say that a little of this cream does go quite a long way.  If you slather a ton of it on at once, it will leave you feeling a bit sticky. An earlier review mentioned that it can leave you feeling greasy if you put it on your face; however, it should be noted that Dream Cream is meant to be used on the hands and body and not meant to be used as a facial moisturizer. 

I would also have to say that the scent is definitely herbal, but the scent (at least for my tub of Dream Cream) was quite subtle.  I did not find it overwhelming. If you are particularly fond of the strong scents that characterize many of Lush's products, then you might be disappointed in this cream. But, if you have dry, itchy, scaly skin, I would strongly recommend this cream.  It is expensive, but it is definitely worth it.

Again, Philosophy has added another "needed" product to my extensive Philosophy line.  I absolutely love this scent.  You will come out of the shower or bath smelling clean, refreshing, and crisp.  Not overdone, as you can layer it with a different smelling perfume.  Just delicious

Living in hot and steamy Florida, and looking for something refreshing, I have gone through a range of Philosphy's lemony shower gel combos: first Sweet Sugar (very nice sugar smell, with a hint of lemon) to Frozen Lemon Custard ( didn't like it at all- too much of an artificial vanilla smell, but the first time I didn't like a Philosophy product) and now to Lemonade. I love the smell, like sniffing a real lemon, not a fake lemon scent. Very fresh and clean.  I am following it up with the lemon body souffle and Sweet sugar cologne for a cool, light summery scent. 
As for those who say Philosophy's products cost a lot- they pay a living wage to their employees and put more money on high-quality ingredients for the product, not on packaging and advertising.  Not to get heavy, but I'd rather have a really good quality product than have my dollars going to fancy packaging and an advertising campaign featuring some over-priced cokehead model. 
So, feeling fresh and clean physically and ethically

Philosophy has managed to do it yet again.......  what is unique about this??  Well it is a three in one product it has shampoo, bubble bath and also body wash.  I am not a big one for baths so I admit I did not try that.  I did however use it for the other uses.  Well the fact is that there are a lot of soap products that you can use in the shower, for washing your hair, and also for a bubble bath.  

It lathers up nicely but not excessively......  so what??


Well the most unique thing about this product is the lemon scent.  I love this.  It is very strong and it also manages to scent up the bathroom when I am taking a shower.  I really like the scent of lemons.  If you dont like it then there are other products.  They have this in apple, coconut and some other scent........maybe strawberry??  I personally like the lemon scent the most.  
I have tried other philosophy products and honestly they do not have a bad one.  They do not advertise this but if this stuff does get in your eyes, it stings very little.  

The only drawback is the fact that it is quite frankly expensive........ about a dollar an ounce. There are other products....and I guess you still need a conditioner for your hair

I received this lip gloss a few years ago in a Christmas present, and then I couldn't find it and forgot about it. But a friend of mine had this and was using this same lip gloss a couple of weeks ago and I remembered how great it was. This is one of the best lip glosses/balms I've ever used. The flavor is fantastic and the moisture it gives your lips is unbeatable. It's not sticky, it's not even really noticeable. It's very "natural beauty" if you know what I mean.  :

This is probably the most expensive lotion I have ever bought for myself. Felt bad at first for the price but then my skin was saved! Never have I felt so happy the past winter when there is no crack, irritation on my skin. The lotion smoothes and make my face feel great. Better than ever!

The pump won't do any difference and it is more expensive, just to let you know. I have both the lotion and the gel but prefer the lotion.

It does work really well in the set of 3 but it's ok to get only the lotion. I guarantee that you won't regret

I have extremely oily skin.  It wasn't unusual for me to wash my face three to four times a day to keep it from shining.  As a result of the oily skin and humid temps (I live in S. Georgia), makeup would just slide down my face and I'd end up feeling like I stuck my head in Crisco by the end of the day.  A friend suggested Clinique and though the oil isn't completely gone...which wouldn't be desireable anyways...it is finally manageable.

I got the DDM lotion as part of the three step program Clinique offers, but I think that the lotion is solely responsible for the changes in my skin.  I could leave or take the toner and soap, which don't seem to be any different than less expensive versions readily available at drugstores.  The lotion though...Wow!  It doesn't go on greasy or watery.  Instead, it has a nice and light consistency that is easy to smooth over your skin but is thick enough that it's not hard to contain or control with your fingertips.  As soon as you rub it in, you notice the mattifying properties.  The lotion actually helps to reduce shine by itself, but without any tightness or by depriving your skin of its moisture.  Some of the stuff I've tried in the past only dried my skin out temporarily and then the oil glands would really start to kick in with a vengence, but with this lotion I haven't had any of those problems.  My skin is now smoother than it's ever been, and the oil glands are apparently appeased as well because I haven't had to wash my face in the middle of the afternoons anymore.

This is a great moisturizer. It does not leave your skin feeling like it has an oil slick and also does not make it feel dry after it absorbs into it. It is great under makeup as it does not make your makeup slide off your face. I have been using it for years. Best moisturizer I ever tried.  It isn't great for night time wear, as I like something a little heavier at night/ I am in my forties and night time I need something a little heavier to moisturize my face. If you are twenty something you probably could just use the Clinique product

This product really does apply like butter and is very rich in moisturizers. I have been using it for years and giving it as Christmas gifts. I use it as a very rich treatment for dry legs, heels, elbows. I love the fresh mango fragrance. Before bed, I often cover my feet with Mango Body Butter, slip on socks, and let the good stuff soak in overnight. Then I feel very pampered and I wake up with soft feet

I found this soap in a honey shop in Paris in winter 2006 and after the first use I told my friends about it and afterwards they bought the same soap and continue to buy it today.  It smells like olive oil, but it doesn't smell strongly.  I recommend people using this soap lather and rinse twice in a row for best results, it will make your skin soft and smooth and the natural ingredients make the results long lasting, I use it once every three or four days but it's gentle enough to use every day.  I wish I had bought more while in Paris because it is impossible to find in California

	It seems no one can escape.  There are times when even the best tressed need help with their hair.  Sun, sand, and surf may leave you with many happy memories, but it can also leave hair looking like...well, let's not talk about it.

	Perms, coloring, all intended to make us look better - let's face it, can sometimes leave hair dry and lusterless.

	Time to get serious with Shea butter.  Frederic Fekkai's Moisturizing Conditioner with Shea Butter is a rich, creamy healing potion for less than healthy locks.  It truly hydrates, smells delicious, and nourishes damaged hair.  If your hair is thick, it's also a marvelous detangler.

	Only a small amount is needed - simply apply after shampooing and comb through.  What a difference Fekkai makes

I love that it is not only environmentally friendly, but it is also an incredible moisturizing lipstick. It's very sheer color but you can use a lip liner for a little more pizazz. And we grew the wildflower seeds from the box! Fun and well worth the money. I have 3 shades, Nahinni, Sagarmartha, &amp; Mariska. I prefer the more neutral Mariska

I am a believer now.  

I bought this because I saw a demonstration on QVC.  I really needed a great scrub since I use a spray tan and a great exfloliator helps.  

I'm not sure what amazing grace really smells like, but I liked this smell.  Its not over-powering and not over-perfumed.  Its got a nice clean smell.  I have a bottle of the expensive Peter Thomas Roth scrub but find that the philosophy brand actually holds together and you can feel the scrub.  There is no dripping.  This is truly a great rough exfoliator.  As for the warming sensation, I didnt feel it.  

Buy it at sephora where you can return it if you're not satisfied.

This stuff has the biggest "ying and yang" affect that I have ever witnessed with any Lush products so far...the good part about this is that is has eliminated my need to use a cream conditioner along with my shampoo bars that I usually buy from Lush and the smell really lingers in your hair for days...plus my hair seems shinier than usual...the bad is that, after a few days of use, the ends of my hair started to feel very dry and dehydrated and are splitting and also the smell...after you use the product and the day passes by the smell softens to a smell that's quite nice but when you first use it you get almost knocked over by a very overpowering smell of black licorice!!  I haven't decided if I will continue to use this product..I like the fact that the smell evens out and (eventually) makes my hair smell great but If I do still use it then I will most defintely go back to my cream conditioner

I was alittle hesitant at first...as this was my first LUSH experience, but was soon well rewarded. I have thick, curly, long color treated hair. So to say its damaged is an understatement. Hybrid worked major tho. I doesnt lather like your normal shampoo does, so I was concerned if it was really working. It does...have no fear. I have to use quiet a few swips tho, because of how much hair I have - but still - ive had this bar a month now, and can barely see where its been used. I store mine a traveling soap case and always let dry before closing and dont store in the shower. I still did need a condition afterwards, but not as much as normally. When dry...my hair just feels healthier and less frizzy, but not caked down.

I have had a problem with thinning hair for a while, and wasnt sure what to do about it. I heard from a couple of people that this line was quite good so I thought I would give it a try. I didn't get it from Amazon but a salon in my town. I actually wanted the shampoo for fine thinning hair (system one I think), and they didn't have any left. They told me that all of the Nioxin products were for thinning hair, and to try this one first.  

I have only been using it for a couple of weeks so I can't say for sure that it's regrowing any hair, but my hair looks thicker and it feels alot softer and a lot less greasy, more bouncy. I have noticed that my hair is not falling out and breaking as much also.  I really like the products and I am going to continue using them.

Before Stella came along, I was a Marc Jacobs girl.  I found Stella this month while reading magazines...normally, I hate perfume inserts as they give me a headache, but everytime I would open my magazine, I would wonder, what is that smell?  

I usually do not like rose-based scents, although I do like florals.  I bought a sample size of Stella and tested it on my husband.  I really think there's something in it that makes him crazy....he loves it, and he's not a big fan of perfume!  And I can't stop smelling my wrists....it's feminine without being girly, and "dark" without being musky.  I think it's a perfect scent for a professional woman

Ne Worry Pas is a clever little item with skin calming and moisturizing elements to make you feel good for at least 24 hours. Soya Milk, Bergamot oil, Jasmine and Cedarwood are lovely, but you may also want to add a few drops of lavender (Forces of Nature Organic French Lavender is a favorite) and Egyptian musk (an artificial one you can buy from Caswell-Massey). I also added a little bag of oatmeal, rosemary and two rooibos tea bags. I think I like this as much as Tisty Tosty or Dream On. This bath will make you silky soft all over and leave you delicately scented with delicious essential oils. Your skin will radiate the fragrance for about 24 hours. Alkmaar body soap seems perfect with this experience.

This bath bomb had the longest lasting scent of any Lush product I have used. In fact, I used it this morning and this evening when I got home, my bathroom still carried the scent. I can even smell it on my skin hours later! It also made a lovely, creamy white bath that was utterly calming and relaxing. I think I stayed in for an hour without the scent, look or feel of the bath changing at all (Except for the fact that my water got cold. Wouldn't it be great if Lush could make a product that would be make the warm water last as long as their scents?

Not only does this gel smell terrific, like real raspberry sorbet, it is functional as well.  This lathers up nice and you don't have to use a lot of product.  You use it as a body wash, a shampoo and a conditioner and I suppose for a bubble bath too.  So that makes it four in one.  I take this on trips because its easy to grab and put in my overnight bag and I can take less product with me. I also will use this when I'm running late and have to take a quick shower.  This also comes in many other yummy scents.  Try them and you will not be disappointed.

My title says it all. This smells so amazing, and is such a lush and fabulous lather, that I will never wash with any other soap again. I even bought the perfume because I found myself sniffing my arms all day long after a shower. 

It's fantastic, it's totally worth the money, and it lasts a long time. One bottle lasts me 2-3 months, bathing every day. I've even used this in my hair before... but it tends to dry out my hair a lot and I need a lot of moisture because I have blonded curly hair.

Of all the Philosophy line, I find that this is the best consistency-wise.  It's much thicker than the Amazing or Baby Grace gels, and leaves your hair and skin much softer, and smelling like Ivory soap.  Very clean scented, not too girly.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE the Blackberry Bath Bomb!!!!!  It turned my bath water a very pretty purple color and the smell was WONDERFUL!  I can't really describe it.  It didn't smell fruity to me at all but was very relaxing and soothing.  Once I got out of the tub the smell stayed on my skin for several hours.  When I was putting my daughter to bed she snuggled her head in my arm and just kept smelling.  We both laid there smelling my arms :)

This bath bomb was a little deceptive.  It fizzed fast and made the water a beautiful color.  It smelled great.  Then I thought, OK this will be enjoyable for about three minutes until I get used to the smell and the novelty of bathing in purple water wears off. 

Boy, was I wrong.  After a few minutes I started to feel sooooo much more relaxed.  I had already been bathing in plain, hot water for awhile, so it wasn't just the effects of a hot bath.  This little ballistic has something.  And my skin smelled great until I took a shower the next morning.

This is my favourite Lush bath bomb! It does everything you want a bath bomb to do - it smells great, a fruity (but not blackberry) scent, it turns the bathwater into a cool purple colour, and it fizzes lots! Also it's very relaxing which we can all do with these days. And in the end of the fizzing - you get a small surprise... Don't read this next bit if you want to find out for yourself. It's a little piece of paper that says "BOMB!"

I prefer the bubble bars because I like bubble baths and also they are more economical as you can break them up and use them for more than one bath, but sometimes throwing a whole bomb in is a treat in itself.

For a really indulgent experience, try 1/3 of a Creamy Candy bubble slice with the Blackberry bomb - it makes purple bubbles and smells so yummy. But only for those who like strong scented baths I think..

This bath bomb does not really smell like blackberry; nonetheless, it has a sweet, fruity smell that I cannot quite place my finger on. It smells a bit like grape Kool-Aid, but not as sweet or syrupy. The smell is not as strong as some of Lush's other bath bombs, but it is quite pleasant.

The bomb turns the bath water a wonderfully relaxing purple color. As with  most bath bombs from Lush, it will leave a ring around the tub. In order to remedy this, I usually wipe the tub down with my washcloth after I am done with my bath. Granted, this is not the way that one wants to cap off a relaxing bath, but it will save the agony of having to scrub the tub the following morning. 

The bomb turns the water quite soft and will leave your skin feeling delightfully supple. I was quite pleased with this aspect of the bomb. The scent it leaves on your skin is subtle and lasted for a couple of days.  This is definitely one of Lush's more simple bath bombs, but it is definitely not boring. The small surprise that accompanies the bomb somewhat compensates for the lack of glitter and more powerful floral/fruit scent. 

Not one of the more memorable bombs, but really quite pleasing. If you want to take a break from some of Lush's more overpowering products, this bomb is for you.

Blackkberry bath bomb is a treat for the senses. The fragrant oils in it soften your skin and smell rich and sensual. My house smelled great for a few days from towels and pajamas left scented after the bath. The water turns a purpley tea color. It is just lovely. Go for it!

I am in my 40s and have used Idealist since it was introduced.  It is the only moisturizer I've ever LOVED.  It truly makes my skin like silk.  It feels light going on, I can use it daytime or night, it never irritates or contributes to a breakout.  I use about 1.5 bottles a year, and while I'm generally thrifty with cosmetics and skin care, nothing cheap (or expensive) surpasses Idealist.

I use it w/ my Proactive and its making my skin beautiful.  They actually have a larger size which is a 2.5 oz which retails for 90 bucks.  I would recommened that one

I received about 100 tiny bottles of this from a neighbor...thought it was worth a shot. I'm 27 and have had problems with breakouts since I was a young teenager. Idealist made my skin baby soft, reduced the number of breakouts much better than Clearasil or any other anti-acne treatment did, and also evened out my complexion...I has less blotchiness. I absolutely love this stuff! But alas, I used up all the little bottles and I just can't seem to get myself to pay $40 or more for it...even as much as it worked. I just wish it wasn't that expensive

This lip shine is fantastic if you want both shine and a slightly minty scent and taste on your lips! It's not sticky at all and also can be layered over lipstick for added gloss. This one's a keeper

Rock Star is a creamy pink soap that produces and abundance of lather.  I've found it to be less drying than many other soaps, and less drying than certain of Lush's other soaps (the glycerin ones, like Bohemian and Sea Vegetable.)  While the creaminess is certainly an asset, it also means that the soap melts away quickly, as another reviewer mentioned.  As this is a somewhat expensive soap, more than $7 for about 3 oz., this is definitely something to consider before purchasing.  A bar of this soap lasts me about a week, showering every day.  Admittedly I'm a fairly enthusiastic user, and it's likely possible to use a bit less, but I'm not sure that would make a huge difference.  And this brings us to scent.  If you like sweet, candy-like scents, Rock Star is amazing.  It's very sweet, very pink, and very girly.  Overall, this has a lovely candy scent (the same as Lush's Creamy Candy bubble bar).  It's a bit of a hard scent to explain, but very much sweet and candy-like.  

Overall, this is a lovely, luxurious soap.  It is also an expensive soap.  These are the main benefits/drawbacks.  I gave it 5 stars because I love the scent and texture

This perfume smells so good.  It is not too overbearing but it does not wear off easily either.
It is sort of sweet and light.  I got the sample from Macy's and i finished it ASAP and now I need the bottle!

This is one of the best blotting papers. It does not interfere with my make-up because it has no powder at all and it absorbs oil from skin very well. This paper is rolled-up, so you can cut a piece of paper of the length you desire. I widely recommend this product. Thank you

Ok, if you weren't already aware, blotting papers are merely the same material you use to separate your bum and the public toilet. However, I am not inclined to stuff a few seat covers in my purse. Sephora has put their blotting papers on a mini roller in an attractive light blue container. This is better than other packaging options, where the too small papers are offered in kleenix-box style. Sephora's rolling sheet option allows you to take as much as you need, and offers an efficient cutting edge for easy tearing. Now that's what I'm talking about

The lip gloss was tiny but it was a gift for my Kindergarten aged niece, who loved it. She clipped it on her backpack and felt very grown up. The disco ball is cute, I don't know what the purpose of the other part is though

I loved this bath bomb but it doesn't have a lot of "pow" so if that's what you are looking for, go elsewhere with this one.  In the middle is a hidden surprise which I did like - a tea bag.  I didn't think the scent was all that strong and the water wasn't exceptionally softer but it was an OK experience.  I don't know that I'd get it again though

So when your best friend calls and tells you she is off to Europe and can't stay and chat because she will miss her plane...what is a person to do? Well, hop into the bath with a little "Tea &amp; Sympathy" and call your new best friend. Tea and Sympathy is filled with soya milk, Calamine Powder, Clary Sage (lots and lots - so if you don't like this essential oil - it is very strong), Gardenia Oil, perfumes, Olibanum Oil, Chamomile and a Chamomile tea bag. Something about this particular product soothes the soul and all your problems go down the drain with the water. 

Of course, if you are feeling very wicked, you could always send this to a friend with the note: "Oh, darling, I'm off to Paris, sorry I didn't have time to call." Thankfully LUSH has a solution to every problem and if you like this product, you may also want to try Ne Worry Pas with sweet orange and tangerine. 

Some of my favorite finds include: "Butterball" with Ylang Ylang and Vanilla, "The Happy Pill" with delicious citrus oils and Bergamot, "Youki Hi" with exotic Jasmine and "Golden Slumbers" for a lovely sweet sleep. Looking for something romantic? Try "Romance in a Stone" with a love poem/note or "Tisty Tosty" which is like a love spell so powerful that your true love may even call you when you are in the tub.

Polite smell, with a hint, slight hint of sexiness only to be detected by someone who actually looks for it :) (not obvious).  Love this for travelling to warmer climates, great on the airplane.  For some reason I don't do well wearing this outside of travelling.  Like any perfume, the time of day it is, as well as the place on earth you are has a lot to do with it.  LOVE this... however it's not to be brandished for all occasions

White Linen is a classic fragrance for daytime use. It's fresh, crisp scent is perfect in summer, when heavier scents can "turn"
This was my first "young ladies" scent, and remains one of my favorites.

The other White Linen items: powder, body lotions and soaps are wonderful for layering this perfume. Because it is so light, you can't overdo it.

 With its crisp white and blue packaging, it makes a lovely gift for anyone

Why would anybody review a perfume?. In my case, this is the first time I have done that, and the reason to do so is to recommend it. "White linen" is simply wonderful. Am I exaggerating?. I don't think so...

Truth to be told, I didn't buy it for myself: it was a gift. Notwithstanding that, I have gone on buying it ever since that lucky day in which I discovered it. Why?. Well, because I like it, and due to the fact that it goes well with my personality. I know, that seems a strange explanation, but it is the truth. 

This perfume isn't new, in fact EstÃ©e Lauder created it in 1978, coincidently the year in which I was born. All the same, who needs a new perfume, specially when there is a old one that works so well?. This one includes, among other fragances, citrus, peach, jasmine, lilac, rose and amber. The result is unique, and very pleasant.

On the whole, I can say I recommend "White linen" for those who can appreciate a subtle but special perfume. If you want more words to describe it, I suppose I will have to look them up in my dictionary. But I guess the best course of action would be trying a sample of "White linen": then you will have no doubts of what I am talking about  :)

This product really does what it says - it lifts and smooths, and conceals too.  It's the best concealer I've tried, and I've tried many.  One note though - the lightest shade is very light.  I have very fair skin and found it to be too white, so I exchanged it for the 2nd shade, which would also work well on fair to medium skin.

Great product

There I was waiting shaving my legs and the water in the tub was draining away when suddenly I looked down and noticed all these little glittery confetti hearts. So cute! That was a nice surprise and I didn't see them while I was taking a bath. I did see the little candy flowers floating about. 

This bath has a high "cuteness" factor and if you are in one of those "everything has to be pink" moods, then Think Pink may suit your candy mood. Lavender oil, Tonka absolute, vanilla and neroli oil makes this a calming bath that leaves you a little happier. You may enjoy this bath even more with the calming sweet "Honey I Washed the Kids Sweet Honey Soap" or the "Sultana of Soap" bar which is sumptuously smooth and leaves a fragrance on your skin that lasts all night. 

If you want a pink/vanilla soap, then you may want "Rock Star." If you are into mixing and matching according to scents, then the Trichomania is mildly scented with coconut and looks like a vanilla shampoo bar and it goes well with the vanilla scented American Cream conditioner. 

I vote for a tad more vanilla, although you can toss a little vanilla oil in the bath or some vanilla from the kitchen also works well. Eating sugar cookies in the tub is optional.

It turned the water a pretty pale pink, and I loved the heart confetti. Could have been more of it, though, and the scent could have been stronger. Still, I stayed in that bath for a long looooong time! :

Ohh, what a lovely product for the time most of us love; bath time.
This marvel melts into a soft pink Tonka Vanilla Bean scented bath that smells like a cake and makes you hungry for sweets!

This lovely product contains Pefume, Lavender Oil , Tonka Absolute, Vanilla Absolute, Neroli Oil , Pink Heart Confetti &amp; Candy Flowers!

At the end you have to flowers gliding through your bath water, small but adorable memory that lingers long after the pink bon bon has dissolved

This bomb has the lovely smell of a just opened bag of Valentine's conversation hearts.  It's a sort of vanilla that isn't overwhelming (actually it's Tonka).  The tiny paper heart confetti that fills your pink bath water just brings smiles to the face!  I didn't give it 5 stars due to the scent fizzling out once my bath ballistic was in the water

I have tried just about every over the counter face wash available. I found flaw with each one as they either dried my face out too much,or irratated my face,or just didnt clean my face enough.
This cleanser is the perfect answer! It is fragrant free,and doesnt dry out your face.The PHA gently exfoilates dead skin cells with no scrubbing and leaves face smooth and fresh.
It is an absolute must for those of us with oily and acne prone skin.My dermatologist reccomended it to me a year ago,and I will never go back to anything else again

This is a very concentrated, rich body gel.  You only need a little to get a lot of lather.  The smell is of raspberry as in the name of the product. You feel clean and fresh after you use this shower gel. It leaves no film on your skin.  It also leaves a light scent of the gel.  I've made the mistake of using too much and had to really wash it off.  This is a fantastic body wash and I highly recommend it.  Also try it out in the different scents, they are all heavenly

I absolutely love this lip gloss in sorbet.  It gives a nice shine with a hint of red and the subtle color goes with everything.  I wear it all the time and keep it in my purse.  (Please note that this lip gloss is not very long-wearing and needs to be reapplied during the day.

I have had acne since age 12, and though it's never been severe, I hate it. I've tried lots of over the counter products of various prices, and this is the first stuff I've used that works. However, (and this is a huge however) like most companies Philosophy assumes that acne prone skin is always oily skin. This is not so. My skin is very dry and sensitive, even in the areas where I am most likely to break out. I did notice when I bought the kit that it was likely to strip the oil from my skin, but I assumed that moisturizing would help with that. Not so. The acne cleared up nicely, but now I have a sizable (to me anyway) flaking patch next to one of my eyebrows.
I was using an aveno moisturizer after the h202 cream, and the blemish syrum only once a day (and that sparingly) but I am now going to try the Philosophy Hope in a Jar for Sensitive Skin and put it on after everything. Hopefully (no pun intended) this will help

I never had a problem with acne until my late 20s, when suddenly my skin seemed to turn on me. I found myself with bumps on my cheeks (where my skin was dry), around my nostrils (where my skin was super red and inflammed and raw looking), my nose (oily and prone to blackheads), and my forehead (also oily). I tried several high-end drugstore brands and none of them seemed to work. For months it was this way no matter what I did. I tried Proactiv, which dried my skin out horribly, and stung while I applied the products - I even used those products only every other day and my skin still peeled! I was all set to go to a dermatologist when I decided to give the Philosophy line a chance after hearing so many good things about it from family and friends. 

I've been using it religiously for two weeks, and while I can't say my skin is flawless, it's considerably improved. The bumps have gone down in every area, my nostrils are no longer red and unsightly, no more blackheads, and best of all it feels great while applying and after. Each product also has very little scent to it which I liked as well - no antiseptic smell here! I did find that the moisturizer wasn't quite enough for me so I started using Philosophy's Hope in a Jar for sensitive skin on my cheeks and neck. That and the fact that it cleared up my acne mostly but not completely are my reasons for giving it four stars rather than five.

Overall, I've very satisfied with the product and intend to continue using it for quite some time.

I bought this kit with low expectations.  Being in my 30's and having dealt with moderate acne problems since my early teens, I've literally tried everything.  

I've been using this kit for over a week, and I have definitely seen progress.  All of my existing blemishes cleared up much faster than usual, and I haven't seen any significant new breakouts.  

The only downfall is that this is a 4 step program which is a tad time consuming and tedious, but at this point I'm willing to do it if the results continue at this rate.  I also note that I need to put a top layer of moisturiser on my face as the protection creme doesn't do the trick to keep my skin from drying out in certain areas.  Which makes it actually a 5 step process.  

I've had short term success with other products in the past, so I'm only giving 4 stars for the good start. I am reserving judgement on the last star pending long-term results.  If the system continues to work for me I'll re-review

I'm picky about my lipstick.  Not only does the shade have to be great (not garish or sparkly) but I want it to smell pleasant (or not at all), taste pleasant (or not at all) and I want the case to feel substantial and click when I close it.

OK -- so how does this one measure up?  The shades are awsome.  I like Baby Lips and Natural Lips.  It smells ok -- kind of like vasaline -- but only faintly.  Estee Lauder lipstick has a much stronger perfume smell and Lacome tends to smell fruity.  It tastes faintly like a chapstick.  The case is relatively heavy and it clicks.  Neither the taste nor the smell are off-putting but because I'm so picky it only gets 4 stars.  (The texture is smooth as well and it doesn't feel heavy on your lips.)

If you want natural (not sparkly) lips for everyday this is a good choice

I love trying new fragrances, and when I came across this yesterday and tried it on, - I became hooked instantly.  It's a beautiful perfume that is somewhat floral and fruity at the same time, but isn't too overpowering and for me, lasted quite a while.
The packaging is great.  It's fresh looking and pretty, but it's the fragrance itself that hooked me.  I got a few comments on it right away, so I think I'm going back to the store to buy some.  It might be a little too heavy for hot summer days, but perfect for winter.  I think this will definately suit cooler climates better, or if it's too hot, it will probably become sickly and too strong.  If you like the blend of fruit and floral, this is for you.  It's stunning and different.  I love it

While in Sephora planning to buy Fantasy By Britney Spears I came across the Armani Code. It was kinda hard to miss since there was this GIGANTIC Poster advertising it. So I thought there's no harm testing it right?? I sprayed a little bit on a test strip and fell IN LOVE with it. It smells amazing!!!! It mainly smells like Lavendar to me which is one of my favorite scent. It lasts for about maybe 4 hours so if you go to school or work you might need 1 or 2 refreshes. I spray about 2 squirts each. Also on the days that you want to try something different I recommand the Pink Sugar by Aquolina and Miracle Intense by Lancome

	Love all of the items in Laura Mercier's spring collection - Sheer Madness.  "Sheer" is the operative word here - the makeup is subtle, refined and very flattering.

	The stick gloss rates a ten and all A's from me.  What's not to like about a lip treatment that soothes, smooths, plus adds color and fullness?  Stick gloss is a combination of lip balm, lip color, and lip glaze - a three in one winner.

	My favorite colors are Peony, a deep rose, and Poppy, a festive crimson.   When applied each color is much sheerer than the tube color indicates.  For instance, the Peony appears to be a burgundy tone yet on the lips it is a lovely rose.

     Perfect warm weather tones.

I started college this year and because of my dorm's terrible softened water and the dry air that I wasn't exposed to at my home, my hair turned into a dry, frizzy mess. I came home at Christmas and had to have a foot taken off the bottom of my hair! (it needed a trimming anyway...but still) I still had two feet of damaged hair left. My mom gave me the Ojon Restorative Hair Treatment to use over my winter break and after just a few times using Ojon, my hair became smooth and silky again. Now I use Ojon about once every three weeks and my hair is in such better shape than it was before! When I use Ojon I usually sleep with it in, then wash it out in the morning. I find that it's most effective that way. I have to admit that the first time I used Ojon the strong smell gave me a headache, but now it doesn't give me headaches at all, in fact, I love the burnt chocolate/coffee smell that is has! I would recommend Ojon to anyone with long and or damaged hair. It is a wonderful product

I have always wanted to try Ojon Restorative Treatment and I finally bought it.  My hair has never looked or felt so good in years.  I color my hair and use a flat iron several times a week so it was so so dry.  I put it on last night left it in overnight.  I also got the shampoo and conditioner once I started brushing my wet hair I could tell that this stuff is good.  I will never buy anything other than Ojon again.  Truely it is the best

I've used others in the past, but they end up losing their concealment power in a short time, or end up making me look shinier. This one is easy to apply (it's like drawing on your face) and it stays on a long time. I really love it. :

Thanks to the coverage of PLAY STICKS, that is!  The coverage is significant for my emerging age spots, yet PLAY STICKS does  not look heavy, chalky or cakey at all. Using PLAY STICKS, my face looks like I am using  little make up, and it has a sheer look and dewey finish. PROBLELM:  Finding my color with online shopping!  It is out of stock and I don't live up North where the department stores carry BENEFIT!!!! It is so worth the effort!  I LOVE THIS FOUNDATION, and I have tried the regulars: Bobbie Brown, Este Lauder, Clinique, etc

This is the only foundation that I will ever use.  I have very oily skin with large pores.  My main problem was that 3 to 4 hours after I put on other foundations, my face would be so incredibly shiny it was gross.  Superfit does not do that.  It also doesn't make my skin break out.

Additionally, it's an exact color match.  I have brown skin and finding an exact color match was very difficult for me.  I use "nutty".

The only problem that I have with this foundation and why I didn't give it 5 stars is the fact that it will rub off on your clothing.  So careful, for those of you, who apply makeup before putting on clothing.

I love this shampoo. I havent been using it long enough to see a differece with hair growth, but it definitely leaves my hair clean. My hair actually feels stronger. And even though it states that it has oils in it, my fine hair is not weighed down at all. Leaves my hair shiny and feels good when massaged into the scalp. Helps with oiliness of the scalp. I love it

     Ever think about how much time most of us spend taking care of our skin?  We use potions, creams, and masks on our faces to keep complexions glowing but often neglect our hair save for a quick shampoo and blow dry.  Then, all of a sudden, we look in a mirror and realize these tresses need a treatment! 

     Let's face it, blow drying, hot rollers, curling irons, coloring, the sun all take their toll on even the healthiest of heads.  

     Hair Mask with Shea Butter is both a treat and a treatment for dry, lifeless, lusterless hair.  Shea Butter is, of course, the key ingredient, working its magic to restore lackadaisical locks.  

      It's simple - work a palm size dollop through damp hair and leave on for up to 20 minutes.  Then shampoo and rinse hair well.  I'd also recommend using Fekkai's Apple Cider Clearing Rinse.

       The results are immediate - what a difference you'll see and feel.

       - Gail Cook

This product is AMAZING!!!  I did a lot of research before buying these and they certainly seemed like the best option for the price-definitely so!  They came soooo fast and the minute I used them I was floored!  I have a 32B chest and these inserts are awesome for giving me a little more volume without being overwhelming.  They feel incredibly natural too!  I can't express to you all how overjoyed I am and soooo happy that I chose to go with Takeouts.  I would recommend them to anyone looking for a boost!

Listen, I ran out of my bar soap, and all that was left was my wife's liquid stuff and this 'poofy' thing.  So I used it.  No big deal, right?  Except... except, I... I liked it...  I actually felt more clean.  Now I've got my own (white, if you must know), but I use some of the more manly liquid soaps to balance things out.

I've since learned that the extra clean feeling was due to something called 'exfoliation'.  You should pick up a copy of Seventeen Magazine if you want more info

If I could pick one lip gloss to use for the rest of my life, it would easily be this.  (And as a lip gloss junkie, that's saying a lot.)  It tastes fantastic, smells equally amazing, and shimmers on your lips.  Plus, its decadent tint gives your pout added sheen and mixes well with any complexion.  The best lip gloss you'll ever buy

I got these in the mail today and I was very excited. The packaging is very thin and sleek (soft rubber) which is a bonus since I hate being able to feel those hard packages in my purse. Now, the sheets are very good. The only thing is that they're a bit too rough (for my taste), but they remove the oil and leave a transparent powder on your skin. The powder doesn't even come off of the sheet until it hits the oil! Really neat. Plus,the powder actually stays on my skin for a while, about an hour (I have combination skin; that might be why), so I won't look all icky and shiny. If you have sensitive skin, these might bother you a bit but they DO work very well, a lot better than any I have ever tried.

I've got pretty oily skin - I always have.  These are my absolute favorite oil blotting sheets.  I've tried a wide assortment of other brands, and the Shiseido ones are truly the best.  I really like the light powder on the sheets.  You know it's absorbing without leaving tons of make-up left on your face.

I DETEST those oil blotting sheets which are "rubbery".  Hopefully you know what I'm referrring to.  I don't feel like those sheets actually absorb anything - more like push the oil around.  

After using this product you can visably see all of the oil and grime REMOVED from your face.  I haven't found anything I like better than these.  5 Stars

I have very oily skin, and I like to go powder-free in the summer. These tissues work great, they are the best tissues I have tried and the price is good.

Oil Absorbtion - absorbs LOTS of oil. And believe me, I have a lot.

Powder - There is a little powder on the tissue, and it's light blue. Maybe to make sallow complexions look less sallow? Anyway, it goes away after a few minutes, but it makes my skin nice and non-oily.

Portable - Nice lil foldover packet to take anywhere.

I recommend these tissues for any woman with very oily skin. I use them in the winter and summer. They work better than napkins, are more conveneint that face washing and are a great value for the price

This lip gloss is amazing. It's not sticky  but it doesn't wear off fast, and comes in fantastic flavours. My favourite is Coconut flavour as its smells and tastes like coconut oil which I use at the beach therefore reminding me of the hot beach! Its also really fun to wear. The coconut colour is a hot pink but don't be fooled, It does not come out hot pink on your lips, it comes out a nice light sparkely pink! Its fantastic and my favourite lip gloss ever! the packaging is really cool and its cheap unlike most things!!! Quality buy

Burberry London is definitely a compliment-getter.  It's also versatile, as it can be worn in any weather and with any outfit.  It has notes of peach, black currant, vanilla, and cedar.  

Please do not judge this scent by only sniffing the nozzle or smelling a scent strip of paper.  It smells NOTHING like it does on skin.  Allow it to settle for 5 minutes, and if it works with your body chemistry, you'll know right away. :o)  At first sprtiz, I get a peachy/cedar blast that quickly mellows into a gorgeous, clean, but warm scent.  The vanilla isn't sweet at all.. just warm and inviting.  I have received a lot of compliments on this.

The lasting power is wonderful!  By the end of the day, it can only be sniffed by anyone who gets close to you, but it has developed into a super soft, clean vanilla.  Burberry London can be expensive, but there are lots of places where you can find great deals on it.  The bottle is very sophisticated, simple, and classy.

Try it!

I was really surprised by this one. I'd seen all the hoopla surrounding Burberry's other fragrance, Brit, and yet I found it too heavy. This one, however, is wonderful. It's not too much of anything. It's got a wonderful clean, modern scent that is very easy to wear year round and I've gotten lots of compliments. This is a good everyday scent that will allow you to smell wonderful without intruding upon others.

This product is great, and I love it.  Unfortunately, I bought the wrong color.  It make my eyebrows look entirely TOO dark.  It's really hard to see what the color is online, and I couldn't decide which color to buy.  So I bought the dark blonde color, and had to go back to get the pale blonde one.  If your hair is in between the two colors, go with the lighter one

I have ash brown hair with a few blonde highlights and found the dark blonde/medium brown color very natural.  I used Sephora's slanted eyeshadow brush to apply and was very happy with the results.  It's so much better than the Lancome pencil I used to use

I just received my buxom lips in the mail today. Cute packaging! Generous amount of product, too. I only wish I had picked a different color. I dont think the "color swatch" online is all that accurate. I'd buy it again though..even though its a little pricey. I trust the Bare Escentuals line and own a LOT of their products.  It tingles, and thats kind of a sexy feeling! Lisa in CT

I'm so glad that BE finally came out with this gloss.  My sister got this in a gift set.  I wanted my own (just the gloss) and I got it off of ebay.  This gloss smells like chocolate, the color is subtle, and it makes your lips tingle.  The color doesn't last as long as I would like but my lips look great with Dolly and they are soft when I'm not using this

sadly i bought this product because i heard jennifer lopez uses it, i have no idea if that is the truth but i wanted it anyway. i live in the uk, so the delivery took about three weeks, that said , the wait was worth it. i am twenty five with bad crows feet, due to late nights and alcohol a plenty, so i really did need something to help me out. after a few days of applying day and night i could tell that the lines had softened, enough to make me feel good.the dark circles under my eyes are looking lighter as well so that's a bonus. i dont think this is going to make my lines dissapear but they are hardly noticeable anymore. the cost of the product doesn'y seem that steep as the cream will last for ages, i only use a tiny drop and it's twice the size of normal eye cream's you can buy. overall i am more than pleased with the result's and i will definately be purchasing more, when the time comes.

I purchased this conditioner after having used the Fekkai color-treated (the pink one) version thinking it would be even better for my high-lighted and damaged hair.  While it is still a fantastic conditioner compared to most on the market, I really thought that the pink one did a better job.  Both leave my hair smooth and relatively healthy, but my hair is honestly gorgeous after using the pink Fekkai conditioner--shiny, bouncy, like I never colored it.  Maybe this one is a little too heavy for my hair?  I haven't quite figured out the difference.  

As previous posters have noted, this does have a rather strong smell--sort of a floral, almond fragrance--which is a little stronger than most hair products.  I didn't find it particually off-putting, but I do prefer the clean, simple fragrance of the pink Fekkai conditioner.

All in all, a great product, but I'll go back to my original Fekkai conditioner when this one runs out.  I never thought I would say this about a $20 tiny bottle of conditioner, but it's totally worth the $$.(For comparison purposes, I have medium-length, straight, dirty blonde hair with highlights)

Okay, I know fragrance is a personal preference. This shampoo and the conditioner and hair treatment mask have done wonderful things for my damaged hair. However, I hate the smell. It has a very heavy fragrance that I can only describe as being like incense or myrhh. Very overpowering and gives me a headache. I prefer my hair products to have light, clean, fresh scents that won't interfere with my perfume and won't give me a headache. Thus, only 4 stars. I wish the people at Fekkai would consider changing the fragrance for this product line to something less intrusive

I received a sample of this from Sephora, when I bought another Fekkai product.  I couldn't believe it when I tried it.  It's wonderful, it smells great(my boyfriend loved it), it got my hair really clean and left it soft and with some body, not limp and greasy feeling.  I will only use Fekkai products from now on, they really are the best for your hair

DHT is something I first learned about from my research online when looking for a new shampoo.  There is a good amount info out there but not a whole lot of DHT shampoo companies that I could find.  All I found was revivogen and min for DHT shampoo.  I would not use revivogen because, frankly, I think it looks terrible and don't want to have to hide my shampoo when my girlfriend stays over:)  I bought the min DHT Shampoo cleasng and I am quite impressed.  I was also very impressed with how fast they delivered it (2 days!).

I don't know why its sooooo hard for companies to make a shampoo cleanser and conditioner that dont weigh hair down, strip hair, make scalp itch, etc etc.  BUT these guys finally figured it out.  No problems with this product line and have been using it for almost three months now.  I recommend it highly and it also looks great in the shower fyi

I absolutely love this stuff!  I purchased it along with the Bare Minerals starter kit (foundation powders w/ DVD &amp; all) because I wanted some color to add to the foundation.  I think it's worth your money - actually you would save money rather than buying all items separately.  It's nice that you get your eye, cheek and lip products all in one kit.  I particularly like the Buxom Lips stuff and can't get enough of it!  It's so minty, tingly and leaves a light shimmer.  The Clear Radiance is great!  I use it as a blusher, and if I wet it it makes a great eye shadow base.  The eyeshadow brush is FABULOUS!  I like how there's two ends - one for eyeliner, the other for shadow, although I also use the eyeliner brush for eyeshadow.  The gold glimmer is great and if you wet it comes on stronger.  My only concern is it does get messy - particularly with the onyx color which comes on strong so can only use very little.  Otherwise I think it's a great buy!

I am 41 years old. I have been using this product for about 3 months along with other creams. I have very little lines on my face for my age. No lines around eyes either. This product seems to help. Anything to look a little younger

 I saw this at a local Dept.store, and was quite intrigued by the unique packaging, and name. I sprayed myself with the tester bottle, and LOVED it, straightaway! My Hubby got it for me for Valentine's Day, and I use it faithfully. It has a fresh,crisp, green apple aroma to it. Not too light, yet not too overpowering.Perfect balance.Very girly.Reminds me of a walk in an apple orchard, on an autumn day. A good way to get your apple-a-day

I've always had really dry, chapped lips and was always putting on lip balm under my lipstick, before bed, and probably a million times throughout the day.  But nothing seemed to help...lipstick always seemed to dry them out even more and nothing looks worse than dry lips with lipstick on.  It just makes your lips look even drier.  Buzz Latte Lip balm is the most amazing product ever!!!  It smells like coffee really strong at first but then goes away.  It doesnt taste bad either.  Yes, its $8 bucks for a tube...but the tube is twice the size of normal chapsticks so the cost evens out.  This product lasts forever...why?  Because it stays on so long...even with lipstick or lip glosses.  The first time i put this on was when I tried a friends.  Within hours i noticed a dramatic  difference so I went out and bought my own.    My lips have NEVER been so smooth and full.    Bare Escentuals continues to suprise me with all of their products!!! I dont think I will every try another makeup line.  I think what makes this product work so well is that its got a lot of shea butter in it.  But this product is amazing!  You can even dip it in bare escentuals blushes or eyeshadows and create a matching lipstick.  This is an absolute MUST for any makeup collection or anyone who suffers from dry, chapped lips.  You wont be sorry....you'll notice a difference right away

This product does as it claims and then some. I have only needed to apply minimal applications, and within days my ingrown hairs were no longer. Extreme caution must be taken if you intend to use this product on your face or neck. The label reccomends not to, however With my sensative skin, I have not exeprienced any negative side effects. Worth the price of admission

Like many other oil strips, this locks up all the oil on your face without removing any makeup.  This is perfect for those with oily skin like mine, who need to blot often.

Although I'm sure there are cheaper brands that would do the same, when you blot with these sheets it seems to last longer than others I have used.

Check out your Sephora stores, sometimes they sell them 2 for $10

Yes, this is just water, but packaged wonderfully.  I have very dry, sensitive skin, and the little Evian spritzers (I carry one with me all the time in the winter) help immeasurably.  I spray a little on before moisturizing, or when my skin is flaking.  I always take these on planes--and spritz my face every two hours--and find that this keeps my skin from drying out and from becoming too oily (in reaction to the dryness) on long flights.

Some reviewers have scoffed at this product, pointing out that it's just water and speculating that the brand name is the draw.  I don't drink Evian water very often (I prefer other brands, if I'm drinking bottled water), and if I could find a comparable product I would definitely try it out.  Similar products, like the Body Shop face mists, tend to be scented and irritate my (very sensitive) skin (the exception to this is the face spritz from the Boots Botanical line, but that is hard to find outside of the UK); I've considered just getting a spray bottle and putting regular water in it, but those tend to have larger, more forceful sprayers and I don't want to point one at my face.

With the Evian brumisateur, you're getting just water, but that's all you need; it's conveniently packaged, lasts a long time for such a small bottle, and I love the way it feels.  Highly reccomended (and thank goodness they're carry-on approved, if you buy the small size!

I do love this fragrance but even when I layer the Falling In Love body wash, body lotion and the perfume spray, it does seem to fade a lot faster than other perfumes. Falling in Love is a really great scent so when I do wear it - I will continue to refresh the scent with an occasional spritz throughout the day.

iv'e been using shear splendor marinade for a month and it is making my hair softer, shinier and healthy looking.  i dont usually style my hair(rollers, blowdry etc.) only when i go out. Since I've been using the marinade my boyfriend always thinks i've been to the salon.  It really is great.  the shear splendor shampoo and conditioner are ok nothing more than just what it is.  But this marinade really works.  Try the 2 oz trial  size in the kit. Ive used it for 4 weeks and I still have more than half the bottle left and my hair is down to my waist

This hair oil is amazing! My hair was severely damaged from bleaching, dying, chemical straightening, and heat styling. I've tried everything from cheap store brands to salon products to repair my dry, brittle hair; but nothing has made any real difference until now. Philosophy Marinating Oil has brought my hair back to life! After just one use it was softer, smoother, less dry, and much, much heathier looking. I have been using it for about a month now and my hair looks better than it did before I started dying and straightening it. This product is worth the money

Don't be afraid of the word "oil". This treatment reversed years of damage from my color-treated very long hair after the first use. I love Philosophy products so when I heard about Shear Splendor I didn't hesitate and purchased the entire system. The shampoo and conditioner are the best things I have ever done for my hair. The effects are cumulative and after a few months of continued use, I'm still impressed. I use the Marinating Oil once a week and it's now a "must have" for me.  

The "Marinating" Oil is not what you might imagine an "oil" to be. It penetrates the hair, treats the scalp, smells really good (very subtle) and doesn't feel heavy. It's easy to leave in all night, washes out so quickly and it's instant gratification - beautiful hair. 

Leave it to a great skin care company to apply beneficial treatment properties to hair care.  

This Marinating Oil also multi-tasks for me. I use a tiny bit and rub it into my cuticles and nails.  I use a few drops to tame frizz before I use my flat-iron. I've rubbed a few drops onto my hands and feet when I've felt extra-dry.  This is good stuff!

I highly praise this product.  This is not just another random addition to the confusing mass of hair care lines.  This is serious *treatment* that won't be put on the shelf with the rest of the "things I've tried".

It's worth it. I actually love my hair again.  My color lasts longer, doesn't fade, and the shine just won't quit.  It's taken years and years of damage away.

I can blow-dry, flat-iron, curl... without the fry-factor.  

The shampoo and conditioner last forever. A little really does go a long, long way.

Thank you again Philosophy, you've yet to let me down.

My hairstylist accidentally bleached my hair too much. As if that wasn't bad enough, by the end of that week I noticed my hair was visibly dryer and had lost its shine. I used this "Marinating" oil overnight - slept in a plastic shower cap. I was surprised how easily it washed out in the morning. There was no "oily" residue weighing my hair down either. I was very impressed with the results, it put shine and body back in my hair - and I've only used it once, as they recommend overnight treatments once a week - I'm expecting even better results by the end of the month. I'd definetly recommend this product.

I absolutely love Clinique for eye shadow. All of their eye shadows go on so smooth, never crease, and are just the perfect shades of colors for my skin tone. The Almost Peach color is great because I can use it as a highlighter under my brow or just as a base, either way I use it just about every day!  :

Zeno works!  It is simple.  Hold the device on a new forming pimple and - zap! - It's gone.  It usually reduces in size immediately and is completely gone in 24 hrs - really remarkable.  Also - no chemicals - that is important to me.  

I hope this company goes public - I've never seen anything like it - so no competition!

Use it and loose it - the pimples - I mean

The Zeno is fantastic.  In 1 minute your "blemish" is gone.  I don't have to use all those "deep pore cleansers" anymore.  All you do is hold the "Zeno" on your pimple for 1 minute and it's gone.  My 15 year old kept borrowing mine, so I got a second one!
This is the best invention for anyone with pimples.  I love it.

"Strivectin-SD is much less expensive than surgery, but it's not cheap. Finally, for maxium efficacy, StriVectin-SD must be applied three times a day, every day for 4-6 weeks...StriVectin-SD works, but you have to use it. So unless you're committed to getting rid of stretch marks, don't waste your time, your energy, or your money." 

After months of thinking about an incredibly large skin care purchase, I splurged and purchased the StriVectin-SD cream. If you have ever gained and lost weight or have been pregnant, then you know that you can get stretch marks and they never seem to go away. How do you heal your skin so they literally disappear? Well, to start with, you need a cream that will produce dramatic results in a short amount of time. Especially as summer is approaching. 

I gave this cream a one-month trial. You need very little because this cream is very concentrated. It seems to increase the skin's thickness and firmness, therefore making the depths of indented surfaces much less apparent. 

Results you should see in 4-6 weeks: 

Decrease in the actual length of the stretch mark 
Decrease in the depth of the indented surfaces 
Increase in skin smoothness, thickness and firmness 

What is actually occurring? 

The cream stimulates glycosaminoglycan and collagen synthesis. It will also correct irregularities in skin coloration. The Peptide solution helps to thicken the skin. 

How often did I apply this? 

Just one to two times a day. At first I tried to apply the cream three times a day, but found it was easier to remember to put this cream on after a shower and/or before bed. It seems to work very well with only two applications a day. 

You may also find yourself using this on your face or on areas where you want to see a decrease in wrinkles. 

Not for use by pregnant or nursing women. Consult with your dermatologist before using this product. Do ask your doctor if this product is right for you and start using it as soon as possible after pregnancy/nursing. You will be amazed at the results after 1 month. My main reason for using this product was due to weight gain and monthly weight gain. It seems to have been very effective and I will continue using the product over the long term for maintenance. 

The ingredient list is long (a proprietary combination of skin firming agents, elasticizers and hydrators) but some of the main ingredients include: Sesame oil, sweet almond oil, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3, Algae Extract, Coneflower Extract, Licorice, Cocoa Butter, Shea Butter, Mango Butter, Peppermint Oil and retinyl Palmitate. 

This product has been clinically proven to dramatically reduce stretch marks and you will find many additional uses for this product. Is it better than Botox? I have never used Botox, but I can say there was a definite reduction in facial wrinkles after a month of use on two main areas of my face. 

What else does this product promise? It will reduce acne scars, burn scars, chicken pox marks and scars from old injuries. If you are looking for even faster results, go to your local esthetician and have a microdermabrasion peel. That will help this product absorb better and you will see even faster results. 

I also just found the Derma E Peptides Plus Double-Action Wrinkle Reverse Creme. It also has the Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3 and is perfect for use on your face if you are allergic to nut oils like almond oil. Once you realize the benefits of this ingredient, you will start to recognize the name in many skin products. 

I would love to see them make this product in an oil-free formula for oily skin or at least a formula you could use all over your face if you have oily skin. Use sparingly and you shouldn't have a problem and it is great for areas of dry skin. 

I now enjoy using this product on my body and the Derma E Peptides Plus product on my face.

I was hesitant to spend this amount and not see results. Well, the proof is in the pudding, so to speak. StriVectin WORKS. As I was much heavier at one point in my life, I had stretch marks to show for it. While they never really bothered me before, I thought I'd give it a try, with summer around the corner. I'm at just about 3 weeks of use and they are FADING. Literally. While they haven't vanished completely yet, I am quite happy with the results. They have drastically faded so far, and have lost that 'silvery' look of before. They recommend using this product up to 6 weeks and I plan on doing just that. Simple and easy. And guess what? You can even use this product on your face! They make the claim that it's "Better than Botox" and I would agree. Something you normally do, like putting on lotion is far healthier, simpler and saner. Although it doesn't bother me; the minty scent could bother some people on their face and hence they've released the non frangrant eye creme. LOVE this product

I purchased this comb in the hopes that it would be gentle enough on my fine hair to reduce hair loss and breakage.  After showering, I comb through my towel-dryed hair to prior to styling.  This comb detangles well, although the process is much easier if I've used a good conditioner.  I still experience a lot of hair loss, so I'm not sure if the comb has helped in this area, but my breakage from combing appears to be minimal.  Overall, I'm happy with this product, which has performed well for almost 5 years of daily usage

I am in love with this product.  It smells fantastic - like fresh juicy tangerines/oranges.  It is my favorite scent from the Body Shop.  Equally important, however, is the fact that it is a great shower gel in general.  It leaves no residue at all, and I never feel sticky after using it, as I sometimes do with other scented shower gels.  I always feel squeaky clean and fresh. The consistency of the gel is fairly thin (more like a liquid than a gel), which some reviewers have said they didn't like, but I actually prefer this type of shower gel, and wanted to point out that it is still a very saturated smell, and is not a "watered down" smell at all.  I give this product a very high recommendation.  If you like the scent of fresh juicy oranges, you should definitely try this product.

This powder is great. It has great coverage without looking cakey. I also have sensitive skin and this has never bothered me. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's still a little dark for very light skin and it needs to be "touched-up" a little more often than other powders I've tried, but it's worth it

I got a mini bottle of Cinnamon Buns in a philosophy.com order, and I was surprised how much I liked, since I'm not a huge cinnamon fan. 
I use the 3-in1's when I travel, and I find it depends on the local water whether or not I need extra conditioner, so I bring a bottle of leave in conditioner with me.  The philosophy shower gels really do a nice job of not drying out my already dryish skin, and my hair is always super shiny when I use philosophy 3-in 1.  
That said, this is one of the best smelling philosophy shower gels, and if you're looking for a deal, QVC sells 32oz of several of the philosopy  shower gels ( including cinnamon buns) for $22.00 to $24.0

After trying pure and amazing grace, I have to say that Baby Grace has quickly become my signature scent. It smells sweet and a little flowery. But I really don't see how it smells like a baby! But the only problem is the staying power! It barely lasts a few hours on my skin. I think I'm going to start layering with the matching wash and lotion

If you're looking for the best scissortweezers, look no further. The construction is impeccable and the feel is very solid. I went thru other brands and makes and came across Sephora's own model - very bad. They sell Tweezerman products, but they do not sell this particular model due to the fact that they sell their own flimsy alternative.

Do not substitute this for other products. The price is unbelievably expensive, but once you get hold of it you will understand. You will only buy it once and this will last more than a lifetime

I love this towel.  I'm a small person with shoulder length hair.  I take this in my gym bag and use it to dry my hair and entire body.  It is so small and light that it takes up no space in my gym bag compared with a big bath towel.  It's very absorbent.  My one disappointment is that I have to dry it separately, because fabric softener ruins the absorbency

This product is described as an anti-ager, but I've noticed in the year or so I've used that it works wonders on any number of skin imperfections. It is moisturizing but not at all greasy. It has dramatically reduced my breakouts and has noticeably evened out the skin tone on my chin. It contains an ingredient to "help minimize facial hair growth" and since using it I've been able to reduce my number of lip waxes. It has very little scent and is easy to smooth on. If I had one suggestion to make, it would be that Philosophy sell it in larger bottles as one bottle generally only lasts me about a month.

I'm typing the same review for all of the philosophy products I own since I don't know what is doing it so I'm assuming its all of them..... BUT my skin looks and feels ** FABULOUS ** I have a tendancy to pick at any small thing on my face, which I hate b/c you know you shouldn't do that. Anyway, I haven't had anything to pick at. This relationship is working out well. PLUS, "Falling in Love" and "Amazing Grace" fragrances that they sell, smell AWESOME, LOVE THEM and of course, RECOMMEND THEM !!

The Chisel Brush works well for all-over.  Actually, it was better than that - it swept over everything on my skin without depositing powder unevenly. That's rare for a brush. Usually you have to spend some time with a sponge or fingertips blending, but not with this.

The light cream powder, named the 4-in-1 foundation, provides excellent coverage without being thick.  (Thick powder base is terrible - it always looks like you dunked your face in a bowl of flour!) My freckles are still there, but my skintone is more even. This stuff is concealer, foundation, powder, and SPF protection. Awesome. So much easier than doing everything separately! And no oil, talc, alcohol, fragrance, chemical dyes, or preservatives, but what it does have is Vitamin E and Shea Butter. 

The Universal Marble Powder spreads into a tint that looks fairly natural - sun-kissed perhaps. It did need darkening with the darker powder - at least for me. But only a touch.

The Mineral Glow didn't go on as dark as it looked either. I was actually kind of surprised with this one - most dark powders end up everywhere if you try to shade them out...or impressively dark in one location if you don't. This wasn't like that at all, though I think I'd like a darker color for eyeshadow accents.

And some mascara...and eyeliner...and..and..and.

Large pores are not a good thing, and many products I have tried do little to help.  I used to just use the silicone gel I apply as a makeup base in the troubled area around my nose, but now I have found Clinique Pore Minimizer and find it much more effective.  I find my pores to appear much less visible when using this product, and it does not clog up my complexion and cause breakouts

I have tried (and been disappointed by) several make-up primers (Sephora, Philosophy, etc.) when I decided to try this. I have very oily skin with large pores around my nose and on my forehead but using this product with a tinted moisturizer makes my skin look naturally perfect! 
My skin stays shine-free well into the afternoon (I still end up using blotting tissues- it says you can use this one top of make-up, but applying it causes smearing)
Overall, I couldn't be happier

For years, I was paying more for an imported French mattifier and was devastated when the company stopped selling here. I tried other popular mattifiers (namely Smashbox's Photo Finish), but this was by far the best. Turns out it was a good thing I was forced to find another product. This product makes my shine and the huge pores on my cheeks just vanish.  I'm matte longer during the day, and since blush sticks to this product well, I don't need foundation. I'd recommend it to anyone that wants their skin surface to look smoother and less shiny. I'm not a huge fan of Clinique's in general, but this one product keeps me coming back

Clinique's "Pore Minimizer Instant Perfector" does indeed change the appearance of your skin.  It is incredibly light, just a touch glides on and your pores disappear in an instant.  You can wear it alone or under regular make-up for even more coverage.  I really think this is a great product and it does just what it says it will.  I recommend you use it with no more than a light moisturizer or else it won't be able to get in your pores to work its magic

This shaving gel is terrific! It is not for sensitive skin, as the shave it provides is very close, so it might irritate for those sensitive skin types. It doesn't clog your razor, and a little definitely goes a long way! The only reason I gave it four stars out of five, is because it goes on rather clear, so you really can't see the shave lines, so when shaving my legs, I have to feel for it, but other than that, it's absolutely fantastic, and I highly recommend!

I have always had thin hair.My hair and scalp were left in shambles after a temporary round of antibiotics. I decided to once again to use this product to restore my hair. My hair and scalp are in better condition than ever before. This product is perfect for the "Fix this mess" syndrome.

Not everyone wants to smell sexy I guess, which is why I caved in and gave the 5 starts for the DELICIOUS smell...no one mentioned this but the overall smell reminds me of coconut.  I recognize this perfume on other people and it always distracts me (in a good way).  I would not wear this myself though.  Best in winter.... it'd be annoying in spring/summer.  Now a perfume in which a person NOT wear yet still give it 5 stars has got to be something special :).  Only one other perfume does that to me, Amairage I think...would never wear it, but I enjoy the smell on others

I've been looking for a new summer fragrance and after I smelled it in the magazine I decided I had to have it. Smells like actual fresh flowers at first, dries down to a nice somewhat woodsy floral. This perfume is fairly subtle so if you have a problem with anything overpowering this one is for you

I have been using Lancome moisturizers for many years and every time I try another brand I come right back to Lancome, especially the Resolution D-Contraxol Anti-wrinkle Treatment. (They have updated/renamed this product a few times over the years but apparently only to add some new ingredients - the texture and effects are consistent and I believe better). 

I havent found another moisutrizer that has the same feel as this one- its light and easy to blend and lets your skin breathe so you don't feel "coated" in a thick film. I have found that it makes my makeup go on better and more evenly since its absorbs right into the skin and makes it smoother. It truly makes my otherwise dull skin glow! 

I can't really testify to the anti-wrinkle claims because I'm too young to have wrinkles and wear SPF 60 every time I leave the house, but hopefully its working! My only complaint is that it doesn't have a high SPF protection, but I think adding it would totally change the product and make it thicker, thereby negating all its wonderful attributes. Therefore, I HIGHLY recommend using it twice daily (or once if you prefer a different nighttime one) and adding a high SPF on top to prevent skin damage.

Resolution feels wonderfully luxurious on the skin and is relatively economical in that you need only a little for your whole face and neck - the regular size pot lasts me about two months.  It leaves you with super soft feeling and "pampered" skin, and you can apply makeup rightaway.  As for the promised anti-wrinkle effect, I am not too sure. I think a great deal of the effect is a kind of temporary plumping or masking of wrinkles immediately after application which fades after a couple of hours, especially with makeup on.  But overall, I think it helps keep the skin somehow glowing and I am quite satisfied with this as a nice quality day and night cream for someone my age (slightly younger-looking 37).  Maybe I should also mention that I am quite prone to allergies and sensitive reactions and haven't noticed any adversities with this products in about two years of use

       Ever dream of living on a beautiful tropical island?  Of course, you have.  (Well, maybe not being in residence  forever but perhaps a week away from the 9 to 5 commute would be nice).

	And since we're dreaming there's also a handsome sea captain on the island.  He thinks you're the most beautiful woman he's ever seen - he exclaims about the perfection of  your eyes , your hair, your lips, your hair, your skin, your hair, your face, your hair.

	Wait a minute, what's this fixation he has with your hair?  Ah, it must be the Coolaulin you use, that amazing fresh-from-the-tree coconut conditioner that leaves your hair shiny, soft, and smelling delicious.  

	You should have known!   Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief, sea captain - no man can resist hair treated with Coolaulin.

Smelled like coconuts, but what kept it from sweetness, is it kind of ends up falling off with a bit of a musk.I would've preferred if it didn't have the musk mixed in.The musk unbalances the sweetness of it

The only problem with these cotton squares is that once you use them you won't want to use the ones from the drug store ever again.  They are a good size so they can be cut in half to economize (depending on what you use them for). Nicely boxed

I love this product and can't recommend it highly enough, especially if you love margaritas.  I love the whole 3 in 1 idea: however, I have sensitive skin and very dry hair so I can only use it as a bath gel.  Unless you have normal, perpetually shiny hair and perfect skin I would look elsewhere for hair and face products

Unlike most Lush ballistics, the Happy Pill will foam, rather than fizz.  The two halves smell like Olive Branch gel and Happy Hippy gel, orange and grapefruit.  If it's taking too long to foam, you can break it in half.

Moisturizing and calming, I enjoy this long-lasting, citrus ballistic

I love LUSH Bath Bombs, and this one is a HUGE disc-shaped, awesome smelling product!

A friend in Germany sent me a package with several LUSH items and I couldn't believe how LARGE this bomb was. (I had only tried the round ones before.)

I didn't want to waste it all on one bath so I broke it in half. For those unfamiliar with Bath Bombs, they are made of sodium bicarbonate which means they're like luxury "alka seltzers" for the bath.

The Happy Pill bomb took awhile to dissolve (unlike the round ones) but I was glad for the lingering scent--a delicious fruity aroma.

Highly recommended if you want to get away from it all and have a spa experience in your own bathtub

I was browsing the Bath and Body Works store and saw it, opened up the "Tester" bottle and it smelled devine!  I know it is pricey, but I have thick, straight hair that has recently become very oily, even though I do not use any products.  The first day I used it, I washed my hair and blow dryed it, thinking the smell would not last long.  WRONG!  It happened to be raining that day and when my hair would get wet, that nice apple smell came back.  My hair is very soft and bouncy.  I purchased the 18 oz bottle (yes, sure is pricey) and so far I've used it every day (about a week).  I will try to taper off to maybe 3 days a week, in order to conserve product.  It's a keeper

Glamorous, mysterious, seductive all describe Armani Code, a captivating orange blossom based scent from Giorgio Armani Fragrance. 

As one would expect from this master couturier the bottle itself is a gem. Tapering from a weighted base the slim flacon seems to glow as lacquered shades of blue sweep from an early dawn at the bottom of the sleek holder to midnight nearing the top. Adding to the fragrance's intrigue is an oriental effect achieved by lace embroidery on the glass. 

The scent is sweet yet sensuous with a sparkle provided by orange zest. With orange blossom at its heart Armani Code is enhanced by Sambac jasmine, Madagascan vanilla and honey. The man in my life called it "delicious," and I do, too. It's now high on my list of favorite fragrances.

Even though this scrub reminds me of the teenage days, when the skin would act as if it was being attacked by my own face, trying to get away, I still love using it to fight occasional blemishes. There is nothing this mighty warrior cannot do when it comes to cleansing and purging the skin of clogged pores and dry patches. I don't suggest treating the face like a floor, scrubbing away until the polish wears off, but a good scrub at least once a week for normal to oily skin is not only beneficial but also very relaxing and let me just say that the scent itself makes me feel healthier all ready. I still get this, not only because of my fond memories but for it's ability to perk up and refresh my skin, especially before a mask on a Sunday night right before bed. I love the fresh piney scent of the scrub and its creamy consistency marred with real ground tea leaves.

Tea Tree is found in parts of South East Asia, New Zealand and Australia. The small shrub can survive in places where other vegetation fails to flourish. There are over a hundred eighty species of tea tree, only the oil steam-distilled from the single species of Melaleuca alternifolia is used commercially and it's only found in Northern New South Wales. Since it's discovery the oil has been called a first aid kit in a bottle, not used a moisturizer but as a deep cleanser and antiseptic it's also used to treat pimples, burns, stings, toot aches, gum infections and various other unpleasant occurrences.

Without cleansing and scrubs, skin would take twenty five days to wear off, not to mention the daily doses of makeup, pollution, smoke, mixture of sebum and dead skin, dust, dirt that collect on top, they trap the healthy layers and promote patches of redness and irritation, not to mention breakouts and an unhealthy environment for one part of our bodies that represents us so well is definitely a bad idea. Scrubs such as the tea tree oil one are not only natural but also gentle enough not to harm and over strip the skin when used accordingly to the skin type of the user. To get the most of the scrub, a quick steam bath is also very nice; I cover my head with a clean towel and lean over a bowl of hot water with some chamomile tea in it for five minutes. I don't put my face too close to avoid getting my skin burned but it's very relaxing and a great pore opener before the scrub and a mask.

This is the first foundation I have ever bought that actually matched my skin color EXACTLY.  I seriously can't see it at all on my skin!  It goes on velvety smooth and isn't greasy at all, and after a minute or two, it feels totally natural, with a soft matte finish.  I don't even have to use powder on it to set it.  My only complaint is that is very light and sheer, so it doesn't really cover up a lot of flaws (I have freckles around my mouth that it doesn't cover), but it works fine with a little concealer.  I haven't noticed much in the way of line reduction at all,either, I'm sorry to say.  But still a good foundation in itself

I will start with my age, I am 56 years old and this product is the best I found for covering the problem spots as well as the non-problem spots. 
This Line softening mousse is perfect for our age group who has not only lines to cover, but brown spots and other imperfections that seem to develope. This cream is very soft and you don't even know you have it on. I
I highly reconmend this product

I'll admit after reading reviews on how "small" the soaps where i was bit hesitant but i did it AND I'M SO HAPPY THAT I DID!  I got the rock chick set and fell in love before i even opened it!  The smell is to die for!  I can not explain it except YUMMMM and girls it's monday my bathroom still smells like it from a bath on friday evening!
There was no need for lotion after this bath either!  My skin was so smooth!  The bubbles never stopped!  And the shipping while a bit higher than norm well all i can say is you get what you pay for!  Well worthe it!  I think from now on i'll do a BIG order to save on shipping or what not but after one bubble bath and used the soap once i'm in love love love!  I haven't stopped telling people about this since i got it!
Definitely recommend to ANYONE!
No rings in my tub from the creamy bath or the soap!  And they gave me freebies in w/ my order!  This seems like a company that really cares and knows that word of mouth is what it's all about

If I could have a lifetime supply of these, I would take a bath with one every day. 

People keep saying that you can cut a bubble bar in half and get plenty of bubbles, but I felt indulgent and I used the entire thing. I don't think I've ever seen so many bubbles in one bath! They stayed until the end. The smell was deliciously sweet, and the water was so soft and silky that afterwards I shaved with no shaving cream or anything. 

This may sound silly, but if someone ever made a bed as soft as those bubbles, I'd want one. I was playing with them, kind of patting them between my hands (which didn't pop them), and I just could not get over how soft they were.

When the water got cold, I just turned the faucet back on and added more hot water. Three times. I had so much trouble dragging myself out of that tub that I thought someone was going to have to come in after me!

I still smell like candy several hours later. I even conditioned my hair with a totally different scent, and my hair definitely smells like the bubble bath.

I'm addicted to Lush now! This month has been really stressful, and I'm getting through it by taking a bath every evening with something Lush. The massage bars are also wonderful

I love Lush - have always ordered it from Amazon as we have no local store.  This means that it is hit and miss for me as I cannot preview scents.  This one was a hit!!  This is one of their smaller bubble bars, but still plenty for two baths in a jacuzzi tub.  The smell is yummy and hollywood style bubbles - you know the kind in Pretty Woman!!  Lush is pricey, but I have never bought any other product that makes me feel like I didn't have to fight to get bubbles - like pouring in half the bottle.  If you haven't tried Lush before, this one is a great starter!

This smells of bubble gum or cotton candy and makes lots of bubbles. It is especially nice MIXED with the Butterball bath bomb, which has a vanilla-chocolate scent and the two make a very decadent mix in your bath. If you love sweets, this is a calorie-free way to indulge your senses

I usually add salts and bath oil to my baths as well as bubbles to add skin softening properties....but with this bubble bar, I don't have to!!  It's pink, it smells SO good, and the water and bubbles feel so soft against my skin!!  I absolutely LOVE this one~and I have tried many, LUSH brand and others~so much that I got the rock star soap in the matching scent.  I will say, however, that I have found it necessary to keep it in the fridge during the summer months although it arrives solid-I live in Florida so the humidity makes it soften a bit more than I'd like in the cabinet.  Overall?  20 stars!

I hated to use this bubble bar because it smelled so incredibly delicious!  It is easily divided into two or three chunks for two or three baths.  It does bubble a lot, leaves the bathroom smelling yummy, and leaves my skin very soft and moisturized.  I ended up ordering two more as replacements, I liked it that much.  A worthwhile indulgence to soothe the stress of life away in a tub of candy bubbles

I just started using Pur Minerals' 4-in-1 Pressed Mineral Makeup, and it is a wonderful product. It provides great coverage - even under my eyes, where I have terrible dark circles - and is not as messy as other mineral makeup cosmetics like Bare Essentials. When I used Bare, I used to have to use an additional concealer, too, but not with the Pur Minerals foundation. It was also really easy to find a good color to match my skin tone - and I am Italian, so I have yellow undertones, and it has always been hard for me to find good matching foundations in the past. Best of all, the makeup does not seem to clog my pores. I am not getting as many breakouts as I did in the past, and all I did was switch to Pur Minerals. I highly recommend you try it

I just had my toes done today and picked the color off the wall without giving it a second thought. After I got it on my toes though I just went crazy for it. I had to find the bottle so I could figure out what it was it. It ended up being China Glaze number 71, Sangria. Then my hunt began I went to all the beauty supply shops in my town and no one carried China Glaze. Thank god for Amazon and its vast and every expanding line of products... I can now have a bottle of my own!!! I LOVE THIS STUFF!!

The person from whom I purchased China Glaze Nail Lacquer in Shocking Pink Neon packaged my product safely and beautifully.  She even gave me a free, sample sized lotion.  My purchasing experience was very pleasurable, and I would gladly do business with this person again.  The polish application is a bit streaky, but this probably has to do with the manufacturer and not the seller

I am a fair skinned strawberry blond and was worried about the smokey eye look being too dark on me.  But this kit is great!  You can apply it with a heavy hand or lighter hand and get different effects.  The colors are great and would be great on any skin tone.  BE really did a nice job putting this together

If at first you don't succeed...play around until you get a better result- different approaches seem to work for individual Lush users.  Like most Lush products, Ocean Salt Scrub may take a little getting used to (and may behave differently depending on what type of water you have) but it is lots of fun to play with and delivers a good result.  Probably not for people who want a streamlined beauty routine that can be accomplished fast, but if you like to play... The scrub smells and looks amazing and the vodka/citrus combination definitely helps dry up blemishes.  I have sensitive skin and this has been helpful with once a week usage- any more than that and my skin gets tight and irritated and begins to flake.

One final note of caution: this scrub is serious when it says 'salt', so don't use it on or near broken skin.  Bath &amp; Body Works started using sugar in their scrubs for this reason, but salt has a great effect on clearing up problem skin and tends to help where things aren't seriously broken

This has to be the most invigorating facial/skin product I have ever purchased.  It's gentle enough to use on your face and will leave it polished and smooth (note: use only once a week if you have dry skin!).  If you've had a long day at work, or have been at the mall X-mas shopping all day, grab the ocean salt scrub.  Rub it all over your feet for an instant foot massage and don't forget to rub your hands, as well!  You will soon decide this is another Lush product you cannot live without..

Love, love, love the Ocean Salt. I have very, very dry skin, actually I have psoriasis. I use this to exfoliate my rough patches on my knees and elbows (haven't tried on my face as a cleanser), and it works great at removing all my dead skin. I then moisturize with Dream Cream (another wonderful Lush product) and these 2 products alone help keep my psoriasis under control without using my prescribed lotions.

If you are contemplating purchasing any Lush product, I say go for it. I have been a Lushie for about 3-4 years now (since my trip to the UK), and I have very rarely been disappointed in their products. Be aware that all internet purchases for Lush are shipped from their manufacturing facility in Vancouver, so unless you are willing to pay a bit for expedited shipping, expect a long wait time for delivery.

PS: And, no, I do not work for Lush, I just love their products and their business ethics

  I have been using Ocean Salt for years and have had to start purchasing it in a larger size, as it provides a great all over exfoliating experience.  I have tried similar products for my face, and nothing compares to the way my skin looks and feels after using it.

I tried this mascara a loonngg time ago at Macy*s and remembered it making my eyes really pop.  So after seeing it at Sephora I just had to buy it and test out my memory.  OMG it's just like how I remember it! With just a couple strokes of the wand my lashes are *instantly* lengthened and curled -- it's wonderful! Especially since I have STICK-STRAIGHT lashes that you can't even see unless I have mascara on (it's so irritating -_-;;).  

I think my favorite part about this mascara is that not only do you see my lashes but you see my whole eyes! They really pop with this mascara on, which is quite relieving considering I was told that it wouldn't help me unless I curled my lashes beforehand with an eyelash curler.  I'm sure pre-curling would instensify my look, but I honestly don't think it's necessary.  Besides, I like how natural my lashes look with this mascara on -- it really tricks you into believing that you were born with naturally beautiful lashes... it's so subtle yet defined!

I would HIGHLY recommend this mascara to any girl who needs an "uplift" with their lashes

Most masks made with clay seem to dry out so fast you hardly have time to put them on your face before you need to wash them off. They also only seem to serve one purpose, drying out your skin or removing oil. There are some that leave your face feeling nourished and this is one of the healing clay masks. I have sensitive skin with a tendancy towards being either dry or oily - guess it is that lovely combination skin problem. So, this mask seems to deal with both issues at once - removing dry skin and deeply cleansing the pores. 

Mask of Magnaminty is made with Bentonite, water, kaolin, honey, Phaseolus Angularis Seed powder, Evening Primrose seeds, peppermint oil, flower extracts, vanilla fruit extract and a chlorphyllin-Copper complex. 

This is fun to use in the bath or in the shower while you are shaving. Put it on for a few minutes, let it dry slightly and then rub off dead skin cells. The seeds provide the exfoliating power. 

Almost immediately upon looking in the mirror after leaving the tub, I could tell this mask had healing powers. Along with Dreamwash, my skin looked especially cleansed and calmed. I can recommend both to you if you have a need for skin brightening and calming. These two products seemed to work well together to create a radiant complexion. You may also want to try Prince Shaving Cream and the Dream On bath bomb. The Figs and Leaves soap is also very moisturizing. 

~The Rebecca Review 

P.S. If you can find someone to rub this all over your back, 
it feels so good and is easy to wash off by yourself later (unlike some clay masks I've tried).

I got this for Christmas and waited a whole 20 minutes before I indulged!  Split seconds after I began the application, my skin felt energized, my pores were singing Magnaminty praises.  Aside from the incredible feel of having this mask on, what I loved the most was it's dual personality - its an exfoliating scrub as you wash it off.  I use a variety of masks on a weekly basis and sometimes they are too strong on my skin.  Some feel like they are sucking the life out of my pores, others are very irritating, I can hardly wait for them to dry before washing off.  This mask is an all around great rejuvenator!  I would definetly buy again

HI

<review_text>
I bought this Lush product due to the high reviews by other Lushies and couldn't wait to get home to try it.  

When I opened the pot, the first thing I noticed was the color - it is a little turn-offish, but don't let that stop you from slathering your entire face with it.  The smell is amazing and not too minty or strong.  Like the previous review said below, it smells like mint chocolate chip ice cream.  I put the mask all over my face (you can put it on your neck and back as well), lie down for 15 minutes to get the full spa feel, then wash it off in the shower with warm water.  I find it is much easier in the shower because when the mask dries, it takes some rubbing to get it off.

When the mask is on, your face tingles from the mint and feels so refreshing!  When the mask is rinsed off, your skin feels even better.  Great cleanser and exfoliator in one!

Be sure to keep an eye out on the 'Best by' date because this only has a shelf life of 4 months

I loved this stuff- it was nice and cool and minty.  My face felt tingly and clean afterwards and the stuff smelled great.  It didn't seem to overly dry my skin.  I loved it and I would buy this again.  It really wasn't around long enough to worry about it's 4 month shelf life.

Its refreshing , and its not over powering. I love it.. I bought it for my friend for her birthday and we both usually wear gucci rush... but I wanted something different and this is perfect. Its light and it stays with you all day with just a spray or two.. and its enjoyable for those around you too.. After buying my friend a bottle I went and got myself one and have gotten nothing but compliments... This is a must have !

"Lovely" by Sarah Jessica Parker is hot right now and comes in a beautiful pastel pink bottle.  The scent is flowery, fruity, light and delicious.  The only downside is that the scent doesn't last!  It smells great when you apply it, but is almost completely gone after a few hours.  A great buy for young and old who don't mind reapplying every few hours:-

I love this shower gel, and coming from me, that is high praise, since I do not LOVE to shower, and am especially crabby when this activity must be done in the morning.  You see, I much prefer to languish in a warm bath, letting the bubbles do the work of getting clean for me, and instead devoting my energy to a good book.  Yet when I'm standing in the shower, enveloped in clouds of delicious blackberry steam, I am miraculously transformed from a crabby morning shower girl into a very happy girl who then goes about her merry way and walks up to friends at work offering an arm and encouraging them to "smell me". Lovely!!

I was expecting it to smell like blackberry jam but it smells like ripe, fresh crushed blackberries! I love it, it's sweet, juicy, just very mouth watering. Of course it's a great shampoo, I have fine hair and I don't have to use conditioner everyday. It doesn't weigh my hair down or make it frizzy. Great stuff!

Southwest sun can take its baking toll on hair unless you're wise and usually wear a hat. (I'm not wise and I don't really care for hats. Every once in a while there's an errant breeze during the summer months, and it feels good touching and lifting your hair) Now, I've accepted the blame for often dry lackadaisical locks, what's the solution? 

For me, Fekkai's Glossing Cream with its addition of pure olive oil delivers shine, hydration and manageability. It comes in the trademark Fekkai tube (easy to squeeze with wet hands). 

Since my hair is fine and fly-away it works best for me if I rub a small amount between my palms on towel dried hair and stroke through. Then I repeat the process after blow drying and before styling. 

It's incredibly light yet effective. Fekkai is simply the finest

I use this cleanser in the morning as a primer for other cosmetics.  At night I use the rinse off foaming cleanser, followed by the liquid mild facial soap, clarifying lotion 2, and Dramatically different lotion.  This soap works very well, delivering a very clean, open pore feeling.  It doesn't take mascara off that well, but that's why I use the rinse off foaming cleaser at night first!  Very good all purpose cleanser

You use it by putting the little metal loop around the blemish, then sort of gently pushing and raking it in one direction. Good for extracting white-heads or soon-to-be white heads. If I were to buy it all over again, I'd probably go for the one with the "lance" or little pin at one end instead of the blackhead extractor, sine that side is fairly useless

The first time I put this on, I noticed that the texture was a little thinner than regular Lip Venom.  The flavor is more... I don't know... medicinal I guess. The tingle of the "Maxi-lip" is nice, and it lasts quite awhile.  I put it on a few times the day I got it and was slightly disappointed that I didn't see or feel a difference -- until I woke up the next morning.  There was a noticeable difference in my upper lip and cupid's bow.  I still prefer Lip Venom over 2nd Sin as far as flavor and texture, but this works

"Cleopatra, renowned for her beauty, bathed in milk and almonds to keep her skin silky smooth and well nourished. Modern day goddesses can also enjoy the relaxing and cosmetic benefits of herbal bathing, a simple ritual almost forgotten in these tense and hurried times." ~Burt's Bees Herbal Milk Bath

The hand woven Abaca bag creates a little mystery because you can't quite see all the treats in the bag. What you will find when you open this luxurious Burt's Bees sampler bag is the following surprises: 

A Lavender Mask - Blocks out all the light so you can relax. A delicate and very natural lavender fragrance is subtly relaxing and not overpowering. The silk is quite luxurious and this is a comforting item that will last for years. 

Burt's Bees Pore Refining Mask - Ingredients (they have changed the ingredients to make it work even better than before): French green clay, bentonite, fragrance, peppermint leaf, shavegrass herb, calendula, rosemary leaf and sage. This mask is a lovely avocado green and will make you feel more calm. I loved how the powder can also be mixed with my favorite moisture mask or with natural ingredients for variety. 
I've rarely seen a product clean pores this well. You can simply pour some of the green powder into your hand and mix in a little water. After applying, let dry and then rinse. 

Burt's Bees Royal Jelly Eye CrÃ¨me - A rich eye crÃ¨me that is more like the consistency of a salve. You may be tempted to use this on hands and feet for a little healing luxury. The ingredients are delicious and include apricot kernel oil, aloe, grapefruit extract, royal jelly and vitamin E. Tempting to use as a lip gloss. 

Burt's Bees Moisturizing Herbal Milk Bath - If you were addicted to the Burt's Bees Baby Buttermilk bath, this is a nice grownup alternative. It contains milk powder, buttermilk powder, lavender oil, eucalyptus oil, rosemary oil and peppermint oil. Very relaxing and you may find yourself reading a little longer as you soak away your cares. You may notice your skin being especially healed and moisturized. 

Burt's Bees Calm Balm - A yummy lemon balm made from sweet almond oil, olive oil, beeswax, lemon oil, vitamin E, comfrey root extract, rosemary leaf, lavender, lemongrass oil and lemon verbena. You may start to imagine you are very close to a lemon meringue pie and wonder if you should probably make one. A delicious relaxing scent of lemony bliss. 

Burt's Bees Calming Candle - The tiny candle in this kit is super relaxing and can take you from stressed out to especially calm in a matter of minutes. I tried this candle when I was stressed and it definitely works. Would be a wonderful item to take with you when traveling as it has a lid. 

Burt's Bees Repair Serum - This product supports skin repair and renewal and works to reduce fine lines and wrinkles. Borage and Evening Primrose oils help to promote healthy skin. The oils absorb quickly and soothe and heal the skin. Ingredients: Rosehip seed oil, jojoba oil, lavender oil, vitamin E, evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, wheat germ oil, hazelnut oil, neroli oil, rose oil, calendula extract, green tea extract, beta carotene, tocopherol, vitamin C, vitamin A.

Burt's Bees Shea Butter Hand Repair CrÃ¨me - A luxurious blend of shea butter and cocoa butter, not to mention lavender, calendula, rose oil and rosemary. Not only will this heal and soothe your skin, it is emotionally calming and beautifully scented. 

As a gift, this is filled with healing ingredients that will create a very memorable experience. If you want to sample some of the best of Burt's Bees, it is also an ideal introduction to the world of natural skincare.

I have used this product daily since 1984 and it is worth every cent.  Do not, however, mistake this for a moisturizer.  That it is not.  But it seems to seal in the moisture on your face, and creates a smooth surface for the moisturizer to stay on.

I was told it was not recommended for the eye region, however that's where I use it regularly, and I have a minimum of fine lines &amp; crows feet for my age.

Use it drop by drop.  A little goes a long way!  Follow with a good moisturizer

This is a great sexy, intoxicating blend of gardenia mingled with white exotics.  It's lush and heady.  Whenever I wear this people always ask what I'm wearing.  The only downside is it's expensive for such a tiny bottle, 1/8oz (way small), but a little goes a long way. I've tried a few dupes for much less.  Haute Tub makes one that's almost spot on for about half the price

I purchased Kai Perfume Oil and the Body Lotion through b-glowing.com and I was pleasantly surprised that my items arrived so quickly!  The floral scent is soft and feminine -- great for day/evening wear.  Also, the roll-on is a perfect size especially for small purses

Does that sum it up for you?

How about the fact that it's small enough to tote anywhere.  Or the fact that EVERYONE asks what that beautiful smell is.

It's soft and delicious and lasts all day

Hello! I am an African American female,in my mid 30"s and I have never experence anything like this product before. About 3 months ago my stylist talked me into bleaching my whole head instead of just the striks that I usually get. What a terrible experence!!!!!!!!!! My hair started to fall out on top ( from the end of the crown to the very front of my head) and on one side towards the front. Mind you I had very long shoulder length black hair that was very much health. If I have learned anything as a women is that your hair is your beautie. Since then I was looking throuth the Essence Mag. and notice this product at the time. I order me a bottle and have been taking this product for about a month now. I have notice much change in my hair the growth, the breakage and shedding of my hair is gone. I love this product and would recommended to anyone one who ask

I am a white female in early 30s with long straight hair. I had a lot of stress over the last year and my hair was shedding like crazy, reducing in volume by half and thinning especially on the top of the head. I have been using this product for about one month now and the hair loss almost stopped! Nothing else helped before. I will definitely keep taking the product. I am using it together with the Phyto lotion on the top of my head. The overall result is very promising

These vitamins are great for healthy hair. I've been taking them for nearly a year and have experienced tremendous results. My hair is shiny and grows pretty quickly. After growing out my relaxer over three years ago, I resorted to a press and haven't regretted it. With my bi-weekly maintenance and phyto vitamins, my hair is more beautiful than ever

I am a black female mid 30's and noticed that my hair was thinning in the top. I ordered these and after the 1st month I was amazed at the growth. Even friends noticed the length and smooth texture after 1 month. I will be getting a second bottle soon. I hope the growth will continue as it did during the 1st few months

I had only smelled this perfume in magazine samples, but loved it then.  So I decided to order it.  It was so worth it.  It is one of the best perfumes I have ever smelled.  Very fruity and everyone compliments me on how I smell.  If you like fruity/floral, this is perfect for you

I have moderate acne (sometimes severe, depending on the day!), and this stuff is great.  After I wash my face and put on my lotion, I put this all over my face (all you need is a little more than a pea, maybe about the amt of toothpaste you'd use).  The key is to WAIT 2 MINUTES!  The first time I used it, I didn't wait, plus I think I used too much, and my makeup went on cakey and wouldn't spread.  So now, after I put it on, I put on my eye makeup while I'm waiting.  Also, I used to use Neutrogena liquid foundation (as I need GOOD coverage), but I didn't have much luck with liquid foundation over The Present, even after waiting 2 minutes.  I bought Philosophy's The Supernatural powder foundation, and it goes over The Present soooo well.  I didn't think a powder foundation would cover my acne well enough, but it does!  Both products together are a little pricey for me, but since I use them EVERY day, it's worth it.
Oh and I have very sensitive skin, hence all the breakouts, but The Present doesn't affect me.
The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I never tried another primer, and there may be something better out there, but I'm in no rush to search.  The Present works well for me

The Present is in a class by itself!  I have never seen a facial product do more!  After applying sunscreen and/or moisturizer, apply The Present.  This product will make your foundation (preferably philosophy airbrush canvas) go on smoothly, and makes it adhere to your skin.  Your skin is smoothed out filling in lines and wrinkles, as well as large pores.  It is just the greatest product ever. Sharon Perkins, Cordele, G

I've used this product for about a year and couldn't be happier.  I am not a 'makeup person' and this product is just what I need to smooth out my complexion AND moisturize my oily skin.  Fine lines and large pores appear less noticable, skin remains shine-free, skin tone appears more even and skin feels softer.

One recommendation.....the directions tell you to wait 2 minutes to allow the product to 'set'.  To get the best finish, especially if applying powder (like I do) or foundation over the primer, you need to wait the full 2 minutes.  This can't be stressed enough.

I've been using this product for a couple of years, and I can't imagine ever being without it.  The first time I put it on, however, I used too much and my Chanel foundation refused to spread - it just sat as a blotch on my face.  I took "the present" back to the makeup counter where they told me to use an amount equal to the size of half of a pea - for my ENTIRE face!  I was doubtful, but spreading it super-thin worked, plus each bottle lasts a long, long time.

Here are my favorite things about this product:
-Foundation glides on supersmooth
-Fine wrinkles are less visible
-Makeup stays put all day long
-Keeps oily skin shine-free
-Works great as an eyeshadow base to keep it from creasing
-Makes skin feel soft

The one downside is if I don't wash my face at night, I break out, probably because it really is like a "sealant" for your face.  Other than that, I love it, and will probably never switch to another base.

This product is amazing.  I use it under my eyes and on my cheeks where I have enlarged pores then wait 2 minutes and apply makeup and lines and pores are gone.  It makes makeup last longer too.  My daughter breaks out every once in a while and if she has something important then we put this stuff on over the pimple then apply makeup.  It makes a huge difference and again, it helps the coverage to last longer.

Well as you can tell from previous reviews, not every scent is for everyone, but philosophy Grace is definitely for me!!  I love this scent.  I got the Grace trio as a gift last Christmas and I'm hooked.  Amazing grace is my personal favorite, I like baby grace but it does smell babyish, and pure grace is too 'soap and water' for me to wear by itself.  But I like to layer it with the other graces and mix it up a bit.  After I'd been wearing this scent for a few months I tried to wear another one of my perfumes, and I as soon as I put it on I felt like I needed to take a shower. I realized how overpowering other perfumes can be, and now I'm spoiled, I'm definitely a philosophy girl!  I also highly recommend the shower gel and lotion, helps the scent stay a little bit longer

I recieved this as a christmas gift from my mother. I don't generally like to try or experiment with new chocolates as I am very picky about taste and texture. But as my mom gave this to me and raved about its taste so I thought I'd give it a try. I am so glad that I did!! 
At first I had an issue with the texture but I discovered that if you melt it in a couple of tablespoons of very hot water, then add the rest of the rest of the boiling water (or heated milk if you prefer)it makes the texture smooth and delicious!! I have even made the pudding and it came out fabulous! 
This hot chocolate is definately worth a try!

If you like dark chocolate you will love this cocoa.  It is rich and smooth and a real treat.  The pudding receipe is also yummy!  
The dark is not tart like some dark chocolates.  I have to say I now prefer this over the Marie Belle Regular Hot Chocolate and will continue to order it from Amazon b/c with shipping it is cheaper than direct from Marie Belle Site.

I bought this foundation in Light Beige.  After trying on every single foundatin in Sephora, I asked the sales assistant for something that would match my skin tone, look natural, and not be cakey.

She suggested this, and for forty-five dollars, I was leery.  It was a dewy finish, she said (dewy didn't interest me), and it didn't have a lot of pink in it.

I let her try it on me, but I have bought so many foundations over the years where I get home and it either doesn't look the same as it did in the store or I don't apply it the way they do in the store.

This makeup was different.  Very nice for my dry skin, the dewiness of which the sales assistant spoke actually doesn't leave a shiny, greasy finish.  The foundation goes on naturally, evening out my skintone and making my skin feel soft.  I love this makeup.  I'm just so glad I accidentally found it

I have a secret to tell you. I tried the shampoo you recommended, but don't tell anyone else because if the word gets out on this one, there won't be any shampoo left for the two of us. The lemon oil really did make my hair feel frisky and with the papaya juice, not a single strand felt the weight of hairspray buildup. Thank you for showing the way to silky clean hair. I felt like a kid again who was running around in a lemon orchard, my hair loves this shampoo. As an added bonus, it also lightened my Lush henna experience, just slightly, so now I have the perfect hair color. 

Smiles,
Rebecca 

~The Rebecca Review

P.S. 
Try the Veganese conditioner with this shampoo because it also has a lemony scent and seems to be a nice lightweight conditioner. 

P.S. II 
While you are doing the citrus thing in the shower, why not try the Happy Hippy body gel with grapefruit too. I think it really does balance your aura. I feel cleansed.

My favorite thing about I Love Juicy shampoo is how little is needed to do the job. A dime's worth fabulously lathers my long hair. This would be great to travel with. 

I also found it cleans my oily hair exceptionally well. It smells good to boot. The scent, to me, is like grapefruit candy -- almost, but not quite, too fruity for my liking. 

I'm ordering more

The thing I like the best is the awesome fresh fruit smell. Not overpowering at all and not tacky like department-store brands. Actually smells like yummy fruits blended together. Not to mention that my hair looks amazing after.

The only thing I don't like: I Love Juicy smells so great, I never want to use any conditioner in my hair after because I want the smell of the shampoo, however I NEED to use conditioner on my hair. I found that using American Cream conditioner makes you smell like a delicous fruit smoothie! YUMMY

I got this product today and I put it on right away. I have had it on for a little over 5 hours and it stills smells after my workout. It is very subtle but it made my skin feel silky with a touch of shimmer. I do know that your body chemistry has a lot to do with how long it will last so it's not the same for everyone. It's just a nice product to carry in your purse for a little shimmer and glow oh and a wonderful smell of chocolate. It made me hungry though

I was very excited when this product arrived. I immediately opened it and put it on. It smells really nice and it has a very cute shimmer. I will definetly put this on while I am wearing a skirt or a low cut shirt. And the size of this is not bad either. Should last me a while. The only this that I did not like was the amount of shipping I had to pay ($5.95) but it's definetly worth it.

this is hands down my new favorite body indulgence product. smells delightful, just like yummy chocolate, has vitamins to condition your skin, in a convenient roll-on form, easy to travel with, &amp; leaves your skin with just the right amount of golden glow to it. not tacky or over the top, but not noticeable either, just perfect, also arrived on time &amp; the very best, it doesn't leave skin sticky at all!!!!!!!!

The Chocolate Body Glosser goes on smooth and is long lasting.  The chocolate fragrance is something you can enjoy for the whole day.  It has a subtle shimmer that's great in the summer and gives a nice warm appeal to a cold winter's day

Product was in tip-top shape, and is itself a wonderful fragrance, but I ordered in hopes of getting it here by a certain date and it did not arrive by the time I had hoped.  The gift-wrap was very lackluster and could have been MUCH better.

Good product, bad delivery

I bought this after reading an interview with Ms. Brown where she said this one of the pieces of makeup she considered indispensable for herself. She uses it for a bit of coverage on her cheeks or where needed instead of full foundation. So, I got it in Sand and used it on my cheeks, nose and chin, feathering it out to blend with my skin. Sometimes I'm a bit ruddy in those areas and this provided a bit more coverage than my usual tinted moisturizer. I like it and will use it

I absolutely love this fragrance. It smells so light and clean! I'm not usually much for perfume but when I smelled this I loved it. It really does smell like the best soap and water combination. Its a light fragrance but you dont get the strong alcohol smell like you get with other light fragrances. A really great spring and summer perfum

I'm a little leary of buying a fragrance online, but after reading the many rave reviews of Pure Grace, I thought I'd try it. I was NOT disappointed! This fragrance truly does smell like soap &amp; water - you really do have a clean, fresh scent after putting it on. I layered it, so it would last longer, and that would be my one &amp; only complaint - the spray alone does not last very long. But, it's worth it, though. It's a wonderful fragrance

This is the best lotion ever.  It absorbs and moisturizes for a long time.  It contains plenty of cocoa butter.  It is made by the Body Shop so it is never tested on animals.  The fragrance is pretty neutral which is great if you don't want to smell like perfume-y lotion, or if you want to wear a different fragrance.  One of the best products on the market.  The Body Shop even included a free gift

I am COMPLETELY hooked on this face soap-as a matter of fact, I have another bar coming to me in another Lush shipment soon!  Before I had EXTREMELY oily skin-the kind of skin that needed washed multiple times a day in the summertime, but since I've started using this I can go all day and my skin still feels awesome and isn't the least bit grimy or shiny.  It works as an AWESOME exfoliator and, though previous review state that it's harsh, I haven't had any problems with it at all.  My biggest issue with this is that the smell reminds me of a "machine" shop...very "motor oil-ish" which made me VERY sceptical to use it at first but now I can't go with it.  Actually I forgot this item at a friend's house for one weekend and had to go back to using my store bought stuff and my skin was SOOOO oily-I got 8 breakouts in just that one weekend!  I will NEVER NEVER use anything else other than this on my skin again!  If the scent bothers you then I have found that some "Sexy Peel" soap will get rid of it if you use it right after you've scrubbed with Coal Face

My skin is quite oily especially the T-zone area and my face suffers from those pesky small whiteheads around my nose and mouth.  Previously, the only thing that worked for me were regular facials to slough them off.  Not anymore...Within two days of using it, my face is much cleaner and no more visible dirty pores.  I did have to be a bit careful with the drying factor and used it only once a day or every other day.  I don't think this is for everyone but great for those with oily skin.  Ask for a sample if you have a store near you

My husband has very oily skin and this soap is great for him.  It doesn't dry his skin out and leaves his face clean and mosturized.  He also says, "It doesn't smell girly."  It can be messy and leave black bits in the sink, so rinse well and don't use white towels with it.  It is a bit expensive but lasts a very long time.  My skin is combination, and I find the dry spots don't do well wtih this soap, but it really helps with the oily bits.  I use it when I run out of other products, but it isn't my favorite for me

I got a sample of Coalface with another Lush product that I ordered.  The smell kind of turned me off at first, but I figured I would give it a try.  This is the best facial cleanser that I have ever used!!!  Just five days of using it and my face is more clear than it's been for ages!  I'm also a lot less oily, so my makeup stays on longer.  I will be using this cleanser exclusively

I'm in love - Aquolina have done it again!!!

'Chocolovers' is the darker, sexier, naughty but nice sister of the sugary 'Pink Sugar'. Sort of like Dannii Minogue to Kylie.

Not as sweet as 'Pink Sugar', when first applied I got the rich aroma of the lemon and orange, combined with coriander, preventing it from being zesty. I could also smell roasted nuts.

After a few hours the vanilla base comes through and mingles with the hazelnut, with the result being a work colleague commenting on the smell of my hot chocolate (no, I didn't have any).

Enjoy!

This is the best lotion ever.  It absorbs and moisturizes for a long time.  It contains plenty of cocoa butter.  It is made by the Body Shop so it is never tested on animals.  The fragrance is pretty neutral which is great if you don't want to smell like perfume-y lotion, or if you want to wear a different fragrance.  One of the best products on the market.  The Body Shop even included a free gift

Light and refreshing. Different from all other colognes I've used before. Discovered this cologne over Christmas and my wife bought it for me for Valentines Day!  Love it and have used it every day since. Although she bought the bigger bottle. I've been a fan of Calvin Klein fragrances but will have to look into more of Armani's now. This is a great change of pace

       There's something about Armani!  His fragrances are as stylish and classic as his designs.  Acqua Di Gio is a case in point with its virile, mysterious, intriguing scent.  It's fresh and at the same time sensual.

	Notes include Calabrian bergamot, neroli, and the zest of green tangerine, each warming and giving vitality to the fragrance.

	Mr. Armani has said that the inspiration for this scent came from the shoreline of Pantelleria island, a body of land which lies in the Mediterranean Sea between Sicily and Tunisia.   Pantelleria is one of a kind, a rarity as is Acqua Di Gio

okay first of all im not really a kid im 16 years old and while other people my age are trying to impress chicks with Axe and Tag, I am taking the smarter route and using some real stuff. I bought this cologne because everyone I heard about who has this cologne loves it. Yes it may be too popular now for optimal use but it is still one of the best colognes on the market today. When I was checking out Acqua di Gio I didn't think it smelled as good as some of the other colognes and I thought it was too expensive at over 50 dollars, but I bought it anyway. I have not been disappinted at all. Its fragrence is so casual but classy, its so subtle that people who are around go out of their way to smell you and be around you without even realising you're wearing a cologne. The bottle is very good too, its very simplistic and classy which describes the contents to a tee. The bottom line is this is an essential cologne

The concentrated version (Prada Intense Deluxe Eau de Parfum)of this perfume is by far the best version as the 2.7 oz refillable version can smell a bit cheap at first and wears off after about 6 hours.  This one smells strong first thing out of the bottle but never cheap, and certainly not overpowering.  This the best option for the money.  Don't be fooled by the picture used by the retailers to differentiate the Intense Delux from the 2.7 oz refillable; the bottle is not actually purple, that's simply the cardborad cover.  The actual bottle is simply a smaller version of the 2.7 oz refillable

I absolutely love this scent. I originally got the perfume and the 3 in 1 as a gift set and loved it so much I bought the lotion. The scent is a very light sort of cotton candy smell. I have a huge sweet tooth and just love the sweet smells. If you like cotton candy or a sugary smell then you'll love this

First off, I'm a lavender snob.  I like it fresh and grow several types in my garden and so friends/family often gift me with lavender products...but it's rare to come across something with a true, full lavender scent like this product.  It's a great bath product and a little goes a long way.  Just love it! It's so sweet to take a big bubble bath and then go to bed in a cloud of lavender...ahh

This is the ultimate touch when hosting guests at your home. A fresh white hand towel and a new Roger &amp; Gallet soap makes your guest feel so welcome. 

The soaps are French-milled, meaning they are aged and milled under some pressure to make the soap long-lasting. The fragrances are elegant:

Bouquet ImpÃ©rial  
Extra-Vieille  lemon with orange blossom 
Carnation 
Green Tea 
Lavande Royale  
Ginger  
tea Rose
Fern  
Lily of the Valley 
Magnolia  
Gardenia  

All the fragrances are complex mixes with blends of woods, spices and florals. Keep a dozen on hand for your guest bath (and some brand new white towels; these can be bleached and kept fresh and pretty--colored towels tend to fade, so I use white for my guest towels.

I've had the Clarisonic brush for one year now and I love it.  My skin feels really clean and looks very smooth.  Because of the price tag I haven't given any as gifts, but I recommend it to everyone.  Customer service has been great the two times I contacted them.  First because my skin broke out the first week I used it.  They offered to take it back, but I persevered and have not had a break out since.  I also thought the brush had stopped holding a charge, and customer service gave me a number to call, but I was mistaken so I never did make the call. I highly recommend this brush

This is the first bronzer I actually finished. This gives the most natural finish and blends really well. I like that it's matte because I'm not a fan of sparkly bronzer. Ever since I started using this, I'm just addicted and can't live without it. It gives the skin a really natural, healthy-looking flush.

I've got medium/olive skin and I use "Light". My skin doesn't look orangey or dirty. Try it and I'm sure you'll like it. Make sure you use a really good brush.

"Through the ancient process of steam distillation, the fresh petals of a million roses yield just sixteen ounces of the precious essential oil known as attar of rose." 

Attar of Rose is featured in the Burt's Bees Repair Serum. A tiny trial size bottle (5 ml) can now be found in the Healthy Treatment Facial Care Kit, but after you try this product you might want a larger size for daily use. 

This product supports skin repair and renewal and works to reduce fine lines and wrinkles. Borage and Evening Primrose oils help to promote healthy skin. The oils absorb quickly and soothe and heal the skin. 

Ingredients: Rosehip seed oil, jojoba oil, lavender oil, vitamin E, evening primrose oil, borages seed oil, wheat germ oil, hazelnut oil, neroli oil, rose oil, calendula extract, green tea extract, beta carotene, tocopherol, vitamin C, vitamin A. 

Recently I tried this in the bath in addition to 
a bath oil and it seemed to enhance skin softness.

*****
This is a natural facial repair serum from Burt's Bees, and it is excellent for this use.  However, I rarely use it on my face, except at night sometimes, because it is so intense and heavy.  The rest of the time I use it EVERYWHERE else!  I mix it with my overall body moisturizer (which is pure sesame oil) and rub it all over my body.  I use it full strength on my hands.  I use it anywhere on my body that needs attention, healing, moisture.  For special occasions, I use it as an all-over body moisturizer full strength.

I go through probably a bottle a month, so it is "expensive", but I enjoy it so much I don't care.  A little goes a long way, but I am using it for so many things. 

The smell is probably my favorite small of any "beauty" product.  It is an aromatherapy-type smell, earthy, not perfume-y at all. All of the oils are natural, and blend together to create a perfect lovely fragrance.  It is subtle, but unlike anything else I've tried.

The ingredients are: Rosehip seed oil, jojoba oil, lavender oil, tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E), evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, wheat germ oil, hazelnut oil, neroli oil, rose oil, calendula extract, green tea extract, beta carotene, tocopherol, ascorbyl palmitate (vitamin C), retinyl palmitate (vitamin A).  They are all natural and wonderful!

I like the bottle size too, as it is easy to travel with. At the price, I consider Burt's Bees Repair Serum an affordable luxury that I can't do without!

My skin gets really aggravated by almost every product I try. This moisturizer is an exception! I use Aveeno's ultra calming cleanser, and follow up with Murad's skin perfecting lotion when my skin feels dry. I am 39 with sensitive/combination skin and occasional blemishes. This lightweight moisturizer does not cause my sensitive skin to break out -- hallelujah! Thanks, Dr. Murad, for a great product

Saw this product recommended in a couple of magazines as good, and it lives up to its name.  It's somewhat costly, but will last for a while.  Consistency is that of rubber cement which might not sound appealing, but it goes on easy with your finger and after 15-20 minutes peels off easily

I've been exclusively wet shaving for several months, using a Merkur Trac II style razor.  Having decided to take the plunge to a DE safety razor, I ordered the Merkur Futur Adjustable.  For my initial shave I set it on "1" (least aggressive), and got an absolutely wonderful shave, with no nicks, razor burn, or any discomfort at all.  Even around my jaw line and the point of my chin (notoriously touchy areas) there were no problems whatsoever.  At fifty cents a blade this is a wonderfully economical way to shave after the initial investment in the razor, which barring earthquake, fire, or apocalypse should last a lifetime

This is without a doubt the best razor I have ever owned. Combined with a badger hair brush and cream, it is perfect. In addition, this particular razor is constructed of solid stainless steel. So when it is run under hot water, it gets warm and the thermal mass keeps it warm, an extra nice touch. It is of excellent German craftsmanship and quality and worth the price.

The shave from this razor is so spectacular that I almost get carried away and shave my whole body.

This is an excellent razor.  You can get a very good shave without any nicks or cuts if you use proper technique.  Consult the "Art of Shaving" for how to prepare your face.  With this razor you should use short strokes and do not apply extra pressure.  Allow the weight of the razor to to do the work, a couple of light strokes is better than one heavy stroke and is much less likely to cut your face.  After shaving with the grain you can re-lather and shave against the grain if desired.  This razor allows you to have more control over your shave, but requires more effort from the user than cartridge razors.  For instance, a cartridge razor will pivot to adjust to your face to some extent.  A safety razor is fixed and therefore you have to change the angle of the blade (by raising or lowering the razor's handle in relation to your face) to accomodate the undulations of your face.  This is less of a pain than it may sound, after you use the razor for a week or two it will become second nature.  I have used it for about two week and have not cut my face since the second shave.  If you follow this technique and keep your face properly lathered you will enjoy a nick free and comfortable shave.

One more thing, you will need to experiment with the "closeness" setting of the razor to find what is best for you.  Start with the lowest setting and increase it if necessary.

I took the plunge and bought a Merkur Futur Razor, after years of shelling out for expensive Gillette Sensor blades. The problem with my old razor was that it ALWAYS gave me skin irritation and didn't allow me to shave often enough. With a Safety razor like Merkur's my face gets an easy shave that is smoother than any razor I've used before. My fiance agrees as well. The only problem is that I do take much longer to shave now than I did before. The reason is this: Since there is no lubricating strip on the razors, I have to constantly use more shaving cream to keep the face lubricated if I want to get that perfect shave. I also have a hard time defining my goatee since I go for very straight and clean lines

I bought the extra mild soap and the #1 toner, after breaking out with the mild soap and the #2 toner. the extra mild soap is much creamier and gentle. It gets rid of makeup and dirt and my face feels clean. Using it with the #1 toner and the lotion in the 3-step system, my skin is finally healing from my breakout with the mild soap and #2 toner.

this soap is great, and it lasts a long time. well worth the 11 bucks.

I had been looking for a good under eye cream and stopped at the Lancome counter one day and this is what the saleslady recommended. I really love this eye cream and swear it works in reducing fine lines and firming my undereye area.  Although it is a bit pricey, it is well worth it! It has a nice feel when I put it on and a nice smell. I love and highly recommend lancome products. I will purchase it again once I have used the last drop

I used it like the instructions said and the most visible results were that my eyes had a more "awake" appearance and a tightening of the under-eye area. I've had it for over a yr now and there's a tiny bit left so I need to restock. It's a dense cream and you only need a tiny bit.I have ultrasensitive eyes and it didn't irritate my eyes and it did not have a greasy feel at all. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is not usable on the lids. I tend to get dry eye-lids.

First of all, I do not work for Lancome.  
Among the name brand eye creams I have ever used, this is by far the best.  
Finelines are much less visible right after I tapped it around my eyes. 
I recommend this product to anyone looking for good eye cream.

This gel firms up the skin on your butt, thighs, and hips (and anywhere else you need firming) so you don't have as much of that orange peel/cottage cheese look.  It won't make you fit into smaller jeans, but gives you a more toned appearence

i thought this kit was a steal since it is a credible brand and it included all the basic needs that i use everyday for an extremely reasonable price. i don't use the lip gloss as much as the others because for me, the colors of the lip gloss don't match the natural look im going for. all the other products are out of this world though, they are very light and the liquid powder is like none ive seen before. you can put it on underneath or as a final layer and both work. i definitely recommend this kit because it works with EVERY skin tone.

I've tried Cargo's lipgloss in Soho before, and loved the nude shimmery color, but haven't tried its other products, so I loved that they put this collection together, and the price is right. For seperatly, just the Cream to Powder foundation, its $22 and Beachblush is $26, you're saving money right there...

Most pure badger hair brushes on the market sell for at least $50, so this is a bargain compared to most.  For the first week, my brush shed a little; however, this stopped after the first week.  I have been happy with the brush, especially considering the price.  I would recommend this brush for anyone who thinks they want to start using a shaving brush.  This is a good, inexpensive way to "test the waters".  Then, if you find that you will continue using a shaving brush, I would recommend buying a higher-end brush.

Moisturizing but not greasy. Absorbs well, but give it a little time before you put on mascara. The skin under my eyes is more supple, and crows-feet appear less noticeable, I think because of the moisturizing. Stings a little if you get it too close to your eyes.

I absolutely love this shampoo!  The small amount of product it takes to make a mass of lather is incredible.  Which is nice because you won't go through the bottle that quickly.  It did a great job of gently cleansing my hair without making it feel like straw afterwards.  Now the scent...  Utterly addictive!  Now I'm not a big fan of mint smells,  but the way this was blended with the other scents is amazing.  You can definitely smell the mint, but it's not by any means overpowering.  Mixed in with the mint is a wonderful fruit scent,  that literally smells "juicy".  In the background, very lightly is a touch of herbal.  I happen to HATE anything herbal,  so I was surprised that I even liked this.  The smell is very unique and delicious!

Ok,  all that being said though - it did just as good a job as most any other Lush shampoos (including some of the solids).  I also use their Trichomania and Big and they do the same kind of lovely job Rehab does.  The price just kills me.  I know that real oils, juices and herbs are used, but unfortunately I can't afford to make this item a staple.  Still,  if you don't have a problem with the price,  definitely pick up a bottle (start with the smallest size though!) and give it a try.

Let me start by saying that, yes, I am a LUSH fan, and no, I am in no way affiliated with LUSH (wish I was... employee discount!).

LUSH has done it again.  Another great product that is safe (no chemicals, all natural prodcuts) and actually works better then name brand items.  Rehab Shampoo smells great, a really nice citrus smell, and is perfect for damaged (or not) hair.  My hair isn't damaged that much, but I found Rehab to be a great preventative shampoo also.  Washes out very clean and when followed with Retread or American Cream, my hair has never been better.

Like the other review said, LUSH products take some time getting used to because they don't use chemicalls to make your hair 'feel' soft.  They actually use ingredients that help the damage, rather than hide it.  Please keep that in mind when you try their products.  Give it some time before you make a final discision

I am a first time Lush customer, but this shampoo alone has me convinced to try more of their products. Recently, I have noticed that my "good old" Matrix shampoo has left my naturally wavy hair limp and dull. I read about Lush solid shampoo in Lucky magazine, and thought I'd give it a try. I ordered Seanick through their website.

The box arrived today, and I eagerly ripped it open. Seanick arrived wrapped in tissue paper and I could already smell it. It smelled great, not girly, but like the ocean. I was so taken by this that I hopped in the shower to try it out. The bar itself is just like the picture shows--bright blue and studded with seaweed. I could see how some people wouldn't like the "plants in my hair" aspect, but I like it. The bar lathered up quickly with lots of bubbles. I actually kind of had fun washing my hair for once. I put a little conditioner on as well, about half of what I normally use. As I towel-dried my hair, it actually squeaked. Pretty clean!

As my hair dried, it was nice and fluffy. Believe it or not, it was actually curlier and my sister said it was a little lighter. All good things. I use a lot of product in my hair, so maybe it cleaned all that off. Anyway, my hair feels silky, shiny, and soft. I even used it as a body soap! What a nerd... 

I love the whole idea behind a solid shampoo and think it would be great to travel with. I highly recommend this to anyone, especially if you have limp and boring hair. My only complaint is that the awesome smell doesn't last..

HI

<review_text>
I've noticed that products IN the LUSH stores almost always smell different when you get them out of the store.  In the store, I didn't like the smell of this shampoo bar at all, but I bought it because of the awesome softening benefits of the seaweed.  When I got home to try it out, the smell was much nicer and subtle.  I guess all the smells in the store take over and you can't smell the actual product that accurately.  

This shampoo was wonderful.  Only needed three strokes of the bar down my below-the-shoulder length hair and my hair lathered up really nicely.  Just be sure to keep this shampoo bar (as with all the shampoo bars) out of water when you aren't using it or it will turn into mush.

Took off a star because a traditional bottled shampoo is much easier and convinient to work with and store.  Really nice take with you on trips, though.  If you want a shampoo and conditioner bar, try Hybrid or Godiva

I bought this a while back and used it primarily as a shampoo/shower gel. I recently put my hair through a lot of processing and was worried about what this would do to my perm/color.

Well, one day I ran out of shampoo and used this.

Not only did it not ruin my hair, but it made it look and smell great. No more heinous perm smell. w00t

This is a good and effective cream for creating smoother and firmer skin.  It feels good going on and tightens your pores, creating a smooth feel and look.  Use it with a moisturizer on top.  Even though it is a little expensive, a little actually goes a long way.  I actually felt that my skin felt firmer after 10 days

This mascara is almost impossible to screw up putting on... it keeps my lashes separated and with a few coats really emphasizes my natural lash length.  It stays on all day without rubbing off under the eyes or causing black circles, even if you have to use eyedrops or if it's a super hot day -- AND -- it comes off with simple soap and water... no hard-core scrubbing until your lashes fall off, no need for expensive "eye makeup removers."  Overall awesome product.  Received a sample as a gift and now I'm hooked

This is a great mascara really. It does make you lashes lush and doesn't get really clumpy like some midrange mascaras. The one issue I have is that after a couple hours of wear I notice that black gunk begins to accumulate in the corners of my eyes...not so attractive. Maybe I'm a rare case. I do recommend trying it but just know you might end up with that

I do not have the most luxurious lashes so finding a mascara that will give me the thickness and length that I want is hard. This mascara however exceeds my expectations, the only thing is that I wish it came in waterproof. Other than that, fully satisfied.

Many years ago, I worked in sales management in the beauty industry, and at that time I saw that in some products there was a great difference in the quality of products.

My beautiful wife was a model at that time, but somehow she never learned that fact. For years one of my wife's rituals was to sit in the sink, put on cheap mascara, and spend an hour separating her lashes with an open safety pin. After waiting through this ritual for many, many years, I went and bought her a tube of LancÃ´me Waterproof. After refusing to try it until she ran out of her drug store brand, she finally broke down and tried it. She has refused to use anything else ever since. It makes her day easier, and I get more of her time...

Philosphy's On A Clear Day h2o2 may seem a bit overpriced at $20 for a 1 oz. jar, but it's worth the expense. This tiny jar has a tremendous amount of applications, since only the minimal amount needed to cover the skin is enough to see results. I've had problem skin for years now. For the most part my skin is clear, but I frequently get one or two large cysts that won't go away. This cream has resolved those problems and has smoothed out my skin more in general. It also acts as a gentle moisturizer, without adding extra oil to the skin. I apply a tiny amount to my face every evening before bed, all over--and in the morning I exfoliate with St. Ives Apricot Scrub in the shower. I cannot tell you how much of a difference it has made for me. My skin glows now and is more evenly toned; this was not the case when I was just using the apricot scrub. If you try it, I hope you have the same results as me

This is truly the best in highlighting products and I have tried many high end and cheaper products out there.  This is so light and just doesn't get all cakey and greasy.  I have tried so many brands that claim to look natural, but they just don't.  This really does and don't let the price fool you either.  It only takes alittle and lasts a long time, so well worth the price for the look it gives.  I love this!

I am 51 and recently visited an upscale retail store in Manhattan.  The Yves St Laurent gal behind the cosmetic counter noticed my complexion was a little sallow - put this product about an inch on each side of my nose and blended it in..what a difference it made...a worthwhile investment..I use it under my eyes and just about all over my face for a nice touch-up, concealer and brightener..covers freckles and sun spots, too

I love the taste of this, it's so yummy. Tastes like lemon cookies and cake. Looks good too. I would give it 5 stars except the only downer about Philosophy glosses are that they are pretty sticky, so if you have animals, you get fur stuck on your lips sometimes, or whatever. You know what I mean, sticky gloss attracts things. But it looks good and tastes very good

I recently got this for my birthday and it is sooo life-like. In my opinion, it smells just like the real thing. It's not really strong, as the person before me wrote in her review, but I don't believe its supposed to be. If it was too strong, it wouldn't be refreshing and believe me, this stuff is

I saw them use an airspray type of foundation on America's Next Top Model (not sure which brand) But I was impressed with this technique and wanted to try it - the only one I found was Dior.

By far the best foundation i've tried! I like the other Dior tint foundation - but thought it was too heavy.
The mist feels light...maybe a little too light. Yet once you apply, it does the job perfectly - you really do get an even airbrushed look.

I won't give 5 stars simply for the price - sorry but $60 is too much for a 2.3oz can

Good news is if you apply it right it can last a while

Great coverage -It is so lightweight that you feel like you aren't wearing any makeup at all! I was a little worried that the "spray" would get all over, but it's really easy to apply. It actually makes your skin look flawless

The DiorSkin AirFlash is very easy to apply, and gives a light matte finish that wonderfully evens out skin tone.  Once applied, it's very lightweight- you can't feel it on your skin at all.  Not much is needed, HOWEVER, there's barely any product in the can.  I used it off and on for about a month, perhaps 15 applications in my estimation, and the can was bone dry after that.  For $60, this is unacceptable!  And I wasn't piling it on or anything, I would just do a light mist over my nose and cheek area.

If this was half the price, I would give it 5 stars, it's really a great product, but for a can mostly filled with compressed air, I have a hard time shelling out that kind of cash

It is non-irritating and works. Although not as effective as a tretinoin product in keeping hyperpigmentations at bay, I do notice it helps keep my skin plump. It is emollient without being overly so and is light enough to wear every day. The Cream is a little more emollient if your needs require it. I do use this every day after cleansing my face

This is a clean-smelling, refined fragrance that stays on all day long. 
I recommend it to everyone loving fragrances such as "Costume National" and the like. The package has reached Italy in a couple of weeks by standard shipping, suitably packed up, with free samples included. Besides, European shoppers may rely on a profitable exchange rate.
As far as I'm concerned, I advise everyone to trust Beautiful Perfumes and Amazon.com

This is a day-time fragrance that I can't live without. I'm the type of person who doesn't like things smelling too florally or girly-girl (e.g Paris Hilton or Maria Sharpova fragrances, which don't suit me at all). At the same time, I don't want something that's too " mature" and leaving me smelling like an old lady (too strong and musky). Eau Des Merveilles is somewhat of an in-between fragrance that's hard to describe and very unusual. It's woodsy but it has amber, pepper, and  citris notes. It's refreshing, modern, and chic. 
You don't need to overspay this stuff either. It's potent and you'll probably be mistaken for wearing cologne if you overkill it. 

People like how I smell with this fragrance, and some even say that I smell like "clean laundry," which is a good thing (for me atleast). You should try this stuff at sephora or at a fragrance dealer before buying it though. People's body chemistrys ( amount of perspiration, oil production, foods they eat, etc.) can make perfumes smell differently. Spray it on and seell it after a few hours.

I don't know who writes the descriptions, but this perfume is definitely not sweet. If you find yourself drawn to fragrance notes commonly found in men's cologne you will love this fragrance. It is unique in that it is feminine but with a strong woodsy (I think it is oak or cedar) tone to it. It isn't heavy though, in fact it is very light, very clean, subtly floral, subtly spicy and oaky. All in all, a modern and unique fragrance

This is by far my favorite lip gloss I've ever tried.  It's not gooey or gloppy, as one previous reviewer mentioned. Each color is unique, but blends well with most skin tones (I am a freelance makeup artist, so I have used these colors on varying people).  If you use just a dab, it can even last through my hours in the gym, and definitely adds just the right shine for a photo shoot. 

It may be a tad expensive but worth it.  My one gripe -- did they really discontinue my favorite flavor &amp; color, Sin?

I adore these cute little pots and as with all Urban Decay products, the colors! They're very smooth and creamy which I like,because if I wanted lipgloss to be opaque I'd get lipstick instead. I have no problem with it staying on. In fact I put some on before work today and seven hours later I could see in my car mirror that I still had it on my lips on my way home.My only complaint is price which is a thing with all UD products, but one gets the assurance that the product isn't tested on any woodland critters, and that the pigments are high quality

I agree with the previous commenter that the scent doesn't continue post-bath (which may be a good thing if you wanted to apply a different scent, or a bad thing if you were hoping to smell like vanilla afterwards) also, I wouldn't reccomend just shampooing with this to be the only step in your hair care regime (extremely convenient 3-in-1 is great for travel but not for everyday.) definitely use a conditioner!!!

But all in all it is a very lovely scent, makes a great bubble bath and leaves skin silky smooth &amp; clean

This stuff really works. This is the only product that I have ever used in my life that gives me this shine and soft texture. I always use salon brand products, hot oil treatment, treatment at salons and they were never this noticeable. 

I like the smell. It's nothing familiar or fruity. It's a natural scent. I like it. I would definitely buy this brought again. I wish the product was a little bigger though.

This is THE best conditioner you will ever try.  I have coarse, dry, very straight asian hair and this makes my hair unbelievably, ridiculously, shiny and soft.  I don't know about the smell though, . . my husband isn't to fond of it, but boy oh boy this stuff works.  I kid you not!!!  I have tried almost everything out there from the least expensive to the stuff that I have to ask "How much!?"  none of them come close to this.  The only down side is that LUSH takes FOREVER to ship.  I don't know if it would be faster to order direct.  I'm tell you girls, . . try it.

I have dry, fine, difficult hair and have tried (no kidding) just about every product claiming to add volume and body to hair like mine. From specialty stores to prescription items - I've found a few that do work somewhat.  I depend on conditioners to be the most important product in my hair regime because the conditioner you use has the greatest impact on how your hair turns out that day....trust me - I know.  I've got this hair product thing down to a science.  I used the two Lush products this morning: Big Shampoo and Retread.  Holy **** - what a difference.  I am so happy right now - you should see how good my hair looks today - I used this for the first time this morning and here are some of the key points:

1.  You only have to use a very little bit (I have hair past my shoulders and I only used about 2 teaspoons).

2.  The product smells like Heaven. It's got that affluent expensive natural smell - not that perfumey dimestore smell. 

3.  The frangrance lingers on and on - I've had GUYS tell me how good I smell.

4.  After using with the other product "Big Shampoo (or Hair)" - my hair was thick, soft, shiny, silky, with lots of movement - no static. 

5. This conditioner gives me the perfect moisture balance (for my hair anyway - I have very thin, fine, dry hair).

As far as lush overall:

Let me first state that I am in no way affiliated with Lush - I placed an order for over $100 worth of Lush products and this was one of the products in the order. The only negative thing was the shipping turnaround (little over 3 weeks) but when my Lush items came in - I didn't care. The scent of all the products is gorgeous!!! It's made with all natural products that actually smell awesome and last throughout the day. Not too perfumey at all but definitely recognizable to others. I had guys commenting all day on how good I smell!!!!! The packaging is delightful, the product presentation is adorable, and the quality is better than I've EVER experienced. Better than Benefit, better than Philosophy, etc. I buy and try just about every new product line that comes out - some I like some I don't. I can tell you that this line is my new favorite! I'm going to stock up on everything they have because not only do the products work, they are so pretty to look at that I will use them as decorations in my bathroom!!!

Customer service is extremely responsive and doesn't reply with form letters to your concerns and questions. They said they are working to improve their shipping times and were very accomodating. They also gave me some nice coupons with my order!

10 stars out of 5

Rosebud Salve--what a find!  I wanted it because it was something that I had heard about and knew had been around a long time.  It goes on my lips every night, and is something I will keep around the house and with me.  I've been a long-time user of Daily Conditioning Treatment from Blistex, going through many little pots of it, but Rosebud is replacing it.  I'm ordering extra tins of it today

I have recently bought this product to try and I'm already a little obsessed. I'm a lip product junkie, but nothing compares to this salve. It leaves my lips soft, supple, but not greasy or sticky. And unlike other lip balms (like softlips), it doesn't make my lips flake or peel. It may be a little expensive, but it is well worth the cost.I can see why this has been such a staple for so many people over the years. I'm already in love with it

I am pleased to recommend Rosebud Salve.  My children call it the "miracle salve".  My mother always had Rosebud in the 60's when I was young.  I purchased a jar in Gatlinburg Tennessee, but because I live in Ohio to replace the jar was difficult.  I was thrilled to find it online.  I bought 4 jars for my daughters who are now young ladies with homes of their own.

I recently started using this toner again; I used it for a while in college but my post-college budget didn't allow for non-drugstore facial products. Thank goodness I'm able to use it again! 

Tonique Clarte keeps my combination skin in control despite the North Carolina humidity, and feels good both right after application and several hours later. I've tried numerous toners and this is definitely the best

I have been using this product for a few years now. It is the first foundation that has ever matched my skin tone (very fair) and it doesn't even look like I am wearing foundation. Yet my skin tone looks even and glowing. I love it and highly recommend it. I have gotten many friends hooked on it as well :) It is good for people with problem skin. Since I have been using it I RARELY break out. It is oil free and water based

I was given one of these great bath towels by a friend, and have been nothing but impressed. It is by far the best exfoliation product I have ever used. On my first use, I must say that the salux is a bit scratchy if you are not used to exfoliating.  However, by the second or third use, you've become accustomed to it. The best part about this product is how absolutely smooth and soft my skin is after using it. I feel like silk! It's even managed to take care of the dull rough skin on my elbows, knees and feet. I'm not sure they'v ever been so smooth! The salux also lathers well, dries quickly and does not mildew or mold.

I wear this perfume in the fall and winter (Philosophy's Amazing Grace is my summer and spring scent) and I get so many compliments on it! Everyone loves it (including my boyfriend) and now my sister wants it, too. The description it gives of the scent is pretty accurate. It smells kind of spicy and and warm and fresh all at the same time. A very nice effect. It's strong enough that you don't need a lot to get the desired effect (Translation: don't use too much or you'll knock out your coworkers)

This fragrance packs a strong punch, so use it lightly, and spray it on your legs or abdomen, not around your neck.  This may be why some reviewers aren't fond of the scent.  You'll definitely pick up on patchouli, amber, and sandalwood.  I love wearing this when I have a big event.  I can't add anything about the atomizer; I got a normal spray bottle.

The Prada perfume was authentic and the packaging was genuine. The only problem is the picture shown on the website was not what I received.  I expected to receive the bottle with the atomizer, but it was not.  There was no way to know this from the picture or the description provided.  I highly recommend the perfume good value and smells divine.

I work as a fragrance associate and this is one of my favorites! All of the items are a treat. The body cream is heavenly... The intense is to die for!! If the fragrance is a little too "daring" for you ust the regular lotion with it and it will tame the smell. If you love this other frangrances you'll love are Cartier: Le Baiser du Dragon, and Thierry Mugler: Angel. I love them all!

 I'm going to be cheap and get the larger refillable because it's the same price as a small with the spray. I figure I can just dab it on. I was going to spend a fourtune on the one with the atomizer though seeing all the negative reviews about it, I'm glad I didn't! I'm rating it a 4 for now just based on the scent. We'll see how it works out

I am very picky about perfumes because most of the stronger-scented ones will induce my migraines. My wonderful husband purchased this perfume for me last Christmas, after I sampled it in a magazine. I love the bottle the perfume comes in, and it comes equipped with a "foo-foo" atomizer. The smell is nice and warm, and it reminds me of a winter day spent in front of the fireplace. I always get compliments when wearing the Prada scent.
The downside is that it is expensive- $95 a bottle for the larger size. But I only use it about once a week

When I used to dye my hair this was the only in-shower conditioner that gave me perfect results every time!  Not too over-ladden with oil or weighed down, but perfectly moisturized!  The only thing you may not like is the scent.  It's different than the normal floral or fruity scents most conditioners have.  I personally liked it, but I can see how some people wouldn't go for the musky, almost smoky scent that comes with most Ojon hair products.

I have used this with the Ojon shampoo and my hair's texture has improved tremendously. With the detrimental effects of Idaho's arid climate and turning 40, my thick hair has gotten coarse.  This product has been a pleasant surprise, leaving my hair smoother and softer, like we live on a coast and I'm barely 30. :-

I tried this when I got it in a gift-with-purchase, and wow! This is a fantastic foundation. Repariwear Anti Aging Makeup offers full-coverage foundation with a beautifully smooth finish. It really covers blemishes and discolorations without giving you a mask-like face. It blends smoothly and evenly, and makes a perfect base for all your color cosmetics. It lasts all day without creasing, running, or just getting yucky like other brands do. I am really impressed with it! Plus, we all need to wear foundation with SPF coverage to protect us from the sun. This one offers the best in sun protection, with doctor-recommended titanium dioxide and zinc oxide coverage to prevent wrinkles. I cannot recommend this foundation highly enough

I am a "product freak"....always looking for the best creams and lotions and such for my somewhat aging yet still "combination" skin. ( I will be 41 this spring) I got a sample of this moisturizer as part of a nifty Lancome gift-with-purchase ..and I LOVE IT!!!!!!  It absorbs quickly, isnt too watery, not too rich..not greasy feeling at ALL, and my skin just plumped right up and got VERY pink and dewy after I applied it. Very soothing feeling! Its pricey, but I highly recommend it, and will purchase this when my ( good sized!) sample runs out!

The time had come - the time for some serious reassessment of my skin and the toll time and the elements had taken on it.

 I'd read the ads for Lancome's line - ABSOLUE - which stated it was "one product that addresses the effects of chronological aging." And, IT DOES! It not only addresses those telltale signs (think fine lines, a somewhat dull appearance) but it seems to make quick work of them. 

After use my skin actually has an imrpoved texture and a "life" that seemed lacking in the past. Daily use has made a marked difference. Granted, it is not a minor investment, but it just takes a little for comfortable coverage. My guess is this jar will last me many moons!

i absolutely love these tweezers. they are extremely sharp which allows for precision removal of splinters and ingrown hairs. i also use it for eyebrow grooming because the fine point allows for single lash removal. (helps prevent pulling out too many at a time and creating a disaster) I have just ordered my third pair of these tweezers because I can't live without them! 

as stated below, the tweezers do not come with instructions. Thank goodness my education prepared me for the complicated task of using this tool... If you don't know how to use tweezers, you should probably stay away from this product. it is extremely sharp

OK, I admit the Philosophy line of products are the best I have ever used.  And trust me, I have used them all!  A self proclaimed makeup expert here!!  Just ask any of my friends.  The Philosophy Microdelivery Peel Daily Peel Pads are the best little pads to remove any lingering cleanser, and prepare your face for the Philosophy serum, and moisturizer.  These pads are just full of ingredients that help sluff off dead cells, and let your new bright cells step forward.  Once you try this product, you will never want to apply your makeup products without this first

I use these daily after cleansing my face. They are wonderful. You can feel the product working but there is no burning or stinging involved, just an invigorating toning feeling. The scent is very nice also. The pads are thin but generously saturated with solution, one pad is plenty to do my entire face &amp; neck area.

I've tried Avon's micro peel pads and found them too dry. I often used 2 or more at a time as they just weren't moist enough to do the trick. The prices are comparable and I feel you get more treatments out of the Philosphy peel pads

I jus recently purchased these pads.  I have been using Philosophy skin care for more than a year now, but was feeling like the line was needing a toner like product to help with exfoliation on a daliy basis.  Well, this is it!  The pads are very soft (also very thin).  I definately felt the product working and it made a difference.  I was thinking the product was a bit pricey, but then when I was looking at similar products from other lines, I changed my thinking.  I recommend this product

After the Bathina seductive body wash, this is a sexy cream that leaves your skin feeling silky soft without being overly moisturizing. 

This cream may be best in the summer months as it is not overly rich once applied. It will work well when you are putting on lighter fabrics like silk or anything where a rich body cream would be a disaster. The secret of this formula seems to be the sesame seed oil and cocoa butter. 

There is something powdery soft about this body cream. It has a "whispery don't tell" quality and seems to secretly sink into your skin, leaving only the most delicate hint of sweet cinnamon and faraway ocean breezes. 

The Bathina cream is much more seductive than the body wash, although the two work very well together. You may be amazed at how soft this makes your skin and the scent is delicate enough to allow for the layering of your favorite perfume. I'd recommend the Anna Sui "Sui Love" perfume because it seems to have hints of the same whispery floral beauty. 

The small "to go" size is probably good for two or three applications. I almost used half the container the first time. I'd go with the larger size even if you are buying the small body wash. I like using the body wash for bubble bath but it would also work well if you are going away for the weekend.

This fabulous eye makeup remover quickly removes even racoon eyes as well as waterproof and non-waterproof mascaras - quicker then "Delete" on your keyboard! 

It's the first I've found that easily erases the glitter I love to sport for special occasions. No more pulling, tugging or irritating eyes as long as LAURA MERCIER Eye Makeup Remover is handy! 

Laura, thank you!

Just love it! Been searching for a scent like this forever! When you first put it on it has a soapy clean scent...while at the same time has hints of that "just back from the beach smell!!"
The foaming bath and shower cream is wonderful..creamy and leaves your skin feeling very soft...even good as a shampoo.
The perfumed shimmering body lotion is also wonderful...soft skin with a hint of shimmer..lovely. 
It's light and clean..a beautiful scent. Just bought it as a gift for my sister who like me has been searching for the perfect scent...think she will adore it when she gets it..just like I do!

Women have always been impressed with my name (Placeres); it has attracted them like flies along with the cologne (pleasures) that they find irresistible to them, bringing their fantasies to reality and enjoying a wild adventure with me when I wear the cologne.  These women range from the serious, conservative, glamorous, feminine, sexy elite type to the leather strapping tattoo bike riding, honky-tonk and the sweet cozy ladies of the night, that just want to ride and hump you all the time until you are exhausted.
I personally think that this cologne for men is the best on the market. The name itself is attractive, inviting, intriguing and very catching. All the women that I have dated have always been exited with the smell, and at the end of the night they always thanked me by saying " It's been a great experience and a pleasure, Mr. Pleasures spending the night with you"; they insist on another wild date with me adding that my name and the fragrance have made an impression on them that have resulted in their uncontrollable desires for me! The name of the cologne and my name go very well together bringing out the passion, romanticisms, and animalism with superb ecstasies on kinky dates an experience that they will always treasure claiming what a remarkable man I am. My experience on a tour to South America a few women asked permission to use my name as an advertisement to their exotic full service pleasure agencies; so if your name is not Placeres, try at least the cologne with your mates, and when they complement you, say, Pleasures were made for men and women! Take it from me, SeÃ±or Placeres (Mr. Pleasures) yo se,una buena templada when I get one!

OK, I know it is gross, but if you didn't think you had a problem with your skin then you wouldn't be on reading this right now. I have tried everything, lots of stuff isn't worth 2 cents and then there's Clinique Pore Refining Lotion. This is a must in my daily routine, I even wear it when I am sleeping. How to use: Wash face, then apply after any serums that you may use, but before moisturizer with sunscreen, primer, concealor or foundation. DO NOT PUT TOO MUCH ON if you are planning on layering makeup on top of it, as it will make your makeup flake off your skin. This is not something that you would smear all over, only on your oily areas (such as nose, chin etc). If you use it on your dry areas, it will make your face look to dry. Nobody wants face dandruff on their black turtleneck. WHAT IT DOES: makes your face appear less oily, reduces the size of pores slightly the first few times you use it, but the pores will get smaller if you use it everyday. It also feels pretty nice when you rub it on (warm and tingly). It does contain salicyclic acid, so it prevents pores from clogging. The size of the tube is huge, it will at least a month or two with daily use. I think this works better than any clean-and-clear product, better than biore pore strips, thus the more expensive price. The only bad thing about this product is that it may dry out your skin if you use it too much and cause flaky skin. One of the other benefits is that it will reduce the amount of oil that your skin produces throughout the day, thus you won't have to blot or powder pat as much as normal

i have been looking for a bronzer that was not too orange and just right for my complexion. this one works really well for me. every time i wear it i get compliments on my makeup...not on my bronzer which tells me that it is just adding the extra oomph i need to my complexion instead of looking like i added bronzer. i still use a little blush to give my cheeks an added pink. i'm hooked :

This is a fantastic product! I cannot wash my hair without it.  I am so used to this towel sucking up all the extra water that when I just use a normal bath towel it actually feels weird to have all the excess water in my hair.  This also cuts down on a lot of blowdryer time too. I have fine, medium length hair and this works fantastic for me.  I highly, highly recommend this for anyone who wants to save time on drying their hair in the morning and get out of the door faster.

If you have thick hair, or long hair, or both as I do, then this towel is for you.  It seems a little pricey for just one towel, but believe me, it's completely worth it.  I have hair that hangs about four inches below where my bra crosses my back and it is quite thick.  After ten minutes in a regular towel turban, my hair still drips profusely.  After ten minutes in the Aquis towel, the outer surface of my hair is almost dry to the touch!  Not to mention that the towel holds in a turban perfectly - normal towels are so heavy that I must keep my head upright to keep the turban in place.  With the Aquis, I can bend over or swing my head around and the turban does not come undone or fall off.  I don't like to use hair dryers because it is extremely damaging to your hair; with the Acquis, there's less need to because my hair is half dry after a few minutes in it.  Also, I've noticed that my hair has a lot more volume when I dry it with the Aquis.  I could see how people with thin or very short hair would not get the full benefit of this towel because a normal towel works well enough for them; but if you have a lot of hair, this towel is just like magic

I would never go back to using a regular towel for my hair after trying this little miracle towel. Wrap it around soaking wet hair and it absorbs amazingly. It not only cuts drying time down but makes it unneccesary to rub and rub which is damaging to the hair. They also hold up to many uses. It's really revolutionary!

I have had a 56 year quest for a product to tame my frizzy hair.  I've tried it all.  This product calms the frizz, keeps it calm until my next shampoo-something no other product has ever come close to doing before.  My hair is soft, shiny and everyone is commenting on how long my hair 
is. That is because it is so much more relaxed.  I love this stuff! Do you sell it by the gallon?  Oh, that doesn't mean you have to use a lot.  I have shoulder length hair and I use about the size of a nickel. I just don't want to ever run out!

This is the only product that keeps my hair from drying into a fuzzy, frizzy mess. I technically have straight hair, but it misbehaves a lot and is a bit unruly. This is called a balm, but it is more like a thick liquid that I apply to wet hair. With phytodefrisant I can really see the results after I blow dry. Even if I let my hair air dry, I still see less frizz and my hair is softer. I would not live without this stuff over the winter, especially with dry hair and static woes ahead

Phytodefrisant is one of the rare products that actually lives up to the hype by everyone who uses it. I have heard of it for years but never believed that spending lots of money will ensure great results when it comes to just one styling product, but even after one use I knew there was no turning back. This product is truly amazing as even one application in mid-day turned my hair into gleaming spun silk with glossy reflection and incredible softness and bounce. I can't begin to describe my surprise and adoration for Phyto for crating such a marvel of nature and science in a seemingly inconspicuous metal tube. 

The product itself is an oozing liquidy clear gel like consistency and it disappears into the hair, as I like to put it in the morning after I wash it and brush it through. It makes my hair feel slippery and silky, and I love it. Ever since I've been using it, I get random complements form friends and strangers on my hair, and even my high lights are revived as they look fresh and summery.  This really makes me hair feel luxurious and Im thrilled that I did spend the money on it, for now no matter what I do to my hair, its always a good hair day! As an added bonus I don't need anything else in my hair, which saves more time and money, it's incredible how this one product does such an incredible turn around on my mane, love it

This is my "Holy Grail" haircare product -- I could use almost any other shampoo, almost any other conditioner, almost any other hairspray, but I could *not* ever use any other styling product on my hair, now that I've had a chance to use this. There is a Very Good Reason why Phytotherathie's Phytodefrisant has long been a mainstay of top professional models &amp; has been voted the #1 haircare product by readers of "Allure" magazine more than once -- try it &amp; if you have frizzy hair I guarantee you'll understand, too.

My hair is thick, naturally wavy/curly &amp; prone to extreme frizziness in the slightest humidity, &amp; I've spent most of my post-pubescent life trying to figure out how to straighten it &amp; control the frizziness. Until I discovered Phytodefrisant, the most effective product I had found was Sebastian's "Laminates" (I've tried virtually *every* product promoted to control frizziness that's been on the U.S. market in the last 30 years), but the silicone eventually built up on my hair &amp; on very humid days I had to use so much of it that my hair was weighed down by the coating &amp; felt "dirty". It "looked" reasonably good (for most of the day), but it certainly didn't feel very good to the touch. However, letting my hair go "curly" was a non-starter because the "curls" became nothing but frizz unless the humidity was close to 100% &amp; if I used the "Laminates," it only destroyed my hair's ability to curl &amp; simply made my hair look "dirty" &amp; unstyled.

By contrast, just a teaspoon of Phytodefrisant allows me to blow-dry my hair to soft, sleek, straight smoothness, with no residue detectible at all to the touch. The first time I used it, what struck me the most was how "natural" &amp; "bouncy" my hair felt to the touch (I know, I know, I sound like a TV commercial, but this is *really* true!). I could run my fingers through my smooth, straight hair without detecting the slightest residue of the product &amp; even after a month of daily use there is absolutely *no* build up whatsoever. On days when I want to wear my hair "curly", a single teaspoon allows my hair to dry naturally into crisp, bouncy curls without the slightest evidence of frizziness all day, no matter the humidity.

My hair is shoulder-length &amp; this tube lasts me for about 6 months, which breaks down to a cost of 13 cents a day. If buying a tube for this price seems daunting, Phyto includes a small travel-size tube in its "Petites" travel collection, which would allow you to try a variety of their products &amp; which is also sold here at Amazon.com last time I checked. If you want more reviews from people who take their haircare seriously, check out the numerous rave reviews for Phytodefrisant on makeupalley dot com, where this is one of the highest rated products by a picky demographic group that takes personal care products very, very seriously! ;

...to my suprise though, it was wonderful!  I didn't buy this product on Amazon.com, I picked it up at Sephoria at the mall.  This product is a bit expensive, but so far, it's been worth it.  I've been using for 5 days now, you apply it to wet hair, after shampoing.  When you do, you can feel your hair becoming so smooth and shiny.  I love this product so far, it's all natural too and it really does work.  It isn't going to make your hair 100% straight, no, I gave up on that a long time ago.  What is it going to do is straighten the hair enough, make it managable, and beautiful.  For once, I don' thave to hide behind my hat :)  Will buy again

I have used this a total of 3 times so far and I can already see a difference.
My hair is kinky/curly/unruly. It's fair and I do highlight so I am prone to dryness on the ends.  And frizz?  My worst enemy. The real test will be when the hot/humid weather comes to town.  
But so far, so good.  It's worth every penny

I have horrible hair. And I live in Florida, where non-frizzy hair is impossible for me....until now. I am not happy about the price, but will continue to buy. If you have frizzy unmanageable hair, this product will help you out a lot

This is an excellent product!  Just hard to find!
Does exactly what it says it will do.  Covers scars &amp; imperfections.  I am able to get a smooth finish on my face after covering bad spots with this &amp; then regular makeup on top.  Doesn't cake up when covering "black eyes" either

This is the best smelling perfume I've ever encountered--and the only one I've gotten compliments from strangers on.  It's fresh &amp; clean--not heavy and overpowering like many other fragrances.  I keep trying other perfumes out of curiousity, but I always come back to `Happy'

I got this perfume as a gift, and I'm absolutely in love with it!  It's light, refreshing, citrusy, but it's wonderfully softened by pretty floral notes. Nicely feminine, but very contemporary and sophisticated--it's not like the heavy floral perfumes of the old days. I like it so much I went out and bought the Happy body wash--it just brings my mornings alive and takes some of the pain out of getting up for work.  I also bought the Happy body lotion which I smooth on after my shower.  This gives me a fragrance foundation that I then top off with the perfume.  It's a wonderful way to set out into the world, wrapped in a beautiful, light, refreshing fragrance, and it's not overpowering for everyone else--in fact, I've gotten lots of compliments on my perfume.  It's nice to be noticed!

This is excellent lip gloss. I agree with the previous reviewer. It lasts for a very long time, doesn't feel sticky or liquidy, and doesn't taste bad. Unfortunately, the price is painful at which to look and on the wallet, but it's worth it. I've only tried one color (because of the price) and I think it works very well with my natural skin tones (I use 'Cry Baby'). Next time you're looking for a new lip gloss, check out this one. It's definitely worth it

This lip gloss is so wonderful, I don't know where to start.  Long lasting shine, perfect color, goes on smooth-doesn't feel sticky or gummy like some glosses do, mild fruity flavor.  I HIGHLY recommend this lip gloss to anyone-the expense is worth it 100X over

I love this cologne.It has a great first spray smell and smells even better when you let it sit for a while. I like to were it when i work out cause when i start to sweat the smell gets stronger. I'm no scientist but this is the only cologne that has ever done that for me. I honestly come out of the gym smelling better then when i went in. I love this colonge and it drives girls crazy!!!!!!!!!!

This super balm makes my lips so soft. I usually put it on right before bed, because the taste is kind of nasty, but I forget about my slight taste-discomfort after I wake up with the most supple lips imaginable. No matter how flaky your lips are, Kiss Me conquers all! This is especially good for before/during/after skiing or snowboarding. It's also good for summer as it is somewhat light. I reccomend it, but beware if you get nauseated easily as the taste is enought to do it to you

I LOVE THIS LINE, ESPECIALLY THIS FRAGRANCE. I HAVE PEOPLE ROUTINELY ASK ME WHAT I AM WEARING. ONCE YOU START WEARING THIS LINE OF FRAGRANCE YOU WILL BE HOOKED. I ALSO LIKE PURE GRACE, IT SMELLS LIKE FRESH LINEN OFF THE CLOTHES LINE. THESE ARE THE TWO MOST UNBELIEVABLE SCENTS. TRY IT AND  YOU WON'T BE SORRY. I AM ON MY FOURTH BOTTLE AND I HAVE BEEN WEARING IT FOR ONLY A YEAR! 
IT IS NOT OBTRUSIVE, MY CO-WORKERS AND PATIENTS COMMENT ON THE CLEANLINESS OF THE SMELL. NOT FLOWERY, FRUITY, OR MUSKY. A SMELL ALL ITS OWN.

I received a sample of the Amazing Grace Shampoo,Bath and Shower Gel and was smitten by the singularly heavenly scent!  This prompted me to order a full-sized bottle.  Then I had to have the fragrance to layer with it, so I ordered this.  It's the best! It's like no other scent on the market: very clean and sexy. I've recently added the conditioner to the mix...it's hard to stop

This stuff does exacatly what it says. I have put in on for the past 2 weeks 2x a week. I have a mild case of acne and it seems to get rid of the oil in my skin really well. One thing I will say is that it does dry out your skin. I also sort of wonder why there has to be so many oils and stuff like that in it. I guess it all works together somehow. Overall a very good cleanser.

Sexy, young, VERY sweet..a little bit overbearing if not applied with a light touch. A little goes a long way. Absolutely adorable bottle! ( definitely one you don't throw away)  To me this scent is best described as " cotton candy with an attitude!" I have to be in a certain "mood" to wear this one, but..it IS one of my favorites!

I have worn Lolita for many years,  and everyone always wants to know what I am wearing because they love it.  I have had 2 X-boyfriends, that I am still friends with, tell me they have never forgotten the smell of my perfume.  One of these guys dates back to college and I have been outta there for 8 years now.  I broke down and told them the name of  " that smell they loved" because they want to buy it for their new significant others.  The scent made an incredible impression on me,  but apparently on the other people that have been in my life as well. The scent is dark, seductive, and delicate at the same time.  I notice the scent changes more as the day wears on which I love because it only gets better.  I am told this is called the dry down phase.  Of course I am no professional perfumer,  but out of my collection of scents,  this one is my Annie Hall.... beautiful but different..  and not to be missed.

Now i'm a guy, but I buy this for my best friend back home whenever she runs out. Why? Cause from the male side of it, its literally the best fragrance I've ever had the pleasure to smell on a woman. And once you've experinced this smell guys, you'll never forget it. So don't waste time and go spend the cash and by your girl this gift

I like it, but it is VERY sweet and VERY strong.  Cute bottle, too--best I have seen in ages.  Probably should be worn by younger (than I) women and not if they are going to be riding in a plane or an elevator.  This scent elicits some strong reactions

This is one of my all-time favorite scents. If you love dark fairy tales and you like deep, rich fragrances that last but are not overpowering, this is for you. Wearing this is like entering a shimmery gothic dream. For me the best aspect of this fragrance is the slight licorice undertone, which gives it an edge I haven't come across in another fragrance. And did I mention it's romantic? Just look at the amethyst and gold apple bottle! They're too pretty to get rid of

I love the Brazil Nut Body Butter! I really do, so Im glad youve asked for my review! It absorbs quickly and aids in dry skin healing immediately. I like to layer it a few times over the course of an hour or so. I just cant live without it actually. I had tried with failure, alot of different moisturizers on the market over the years, wasting a ton of money on what I would say is basically false advertising of products that are mostly water and wax based, and was given this butter a few years ago by a friend and have been ordering it ever since. It pays for itself with the first use, and is not only excellent for dry hands but legs and well, just about anywhere you want healed, soft real skin again. I use it on my cuticles after manicures and have instant results there too! I totally recommend it to anyone who just cant get their dry skin to heal and be truly soft. Its not to heavy for summer use either, its just perfect

This mirror is super for tweezing and applying makeup.  So many of the magnifying mirrors are not that sharp.  This one is.  Very handy, it has two suction cups on the back so you can attach it to any mirror, so you always have the kick check to make sure to mascara doesn't end up like Tammy Fay Baker.

Very highly recommended

When I first saw CURIOUS while on holiday, I bought it without trying any. I just wanted the pretty bottle. When I opened it up back home I didn't have high hopes, impulse buying rarely works out does it? So what did I think?

I love it. My first thought was; Sophisticated and classic. CURIOUS can be worn for work, shopping, evenings out - anywhere at any time! 

On the first spay you notice the top notes of magnolia and lotus flower, then the dreamy base of vanilla-infused musk, which lasts throughout the day. The best surprise of all?   After you've worn it for a few hours, you are surprised with the mouth-watering aroma of tangy pear.

As a model, I often have to do my own makeup for my photoshoots. MAC StudioFix Powder is one of my favorite products, as it is a light-weight product with light to medium coverage that I use on top of heavier coverage foundations to provide a matte finish and a tiny bit of extra coverage. 

One of my favorite features is the fact that there is such a wide selection of shades to match virtually any skintone. As recommended on Asianbeautyblog.com for my Asian skintone, I can use C35 and NC35 pretty interchangably - both are yellow based shades, though I find that C35 is more natural looking when used alone because of its golden/olive undertones. There are few other companies that offer such a wide range of shades, especially ones that suit ethnic skintones. I love MAC

MMMMMM Roses. Like a bath in a rose garden- and not that cheap perfumey fake rose smell, its a rich, real, natural rose oil smell. It leaves your skin soft and smelling lightly of roses. A wonderful before-bed soak! We slept like babies. I like that it isn't full of unnecessary colors. Mine was crumbling a little when it arrived, but who really cares- it still does the job. There's nothing more perfect for a Valentines evening

This is a definately must have for rose lovers, the fragrance isn't overwhelming (but if you do find it to be so, you can just use half of the bomb). One tip for all the flower bits is to put this in a old pantyhose (or a mesh bag type of thing) so you don't have to clean the tub afterwards

I have been trying tinted moisturizers and looking for one that suited me since Estee Lauder discontinued their Fresh Air Moisture Tint. I loved that one (in fresh sunlight) as it was just enough to give me a hint of color and worked well with my skin. I have rosacea and experience break outs from many products. I haven't had any problems with the Clinique Sheer Tint (in Neutral) and I am very happy with the lightweight feel of this make-up. As the name implies, this product only gives a sheer tint, it evens out some flaws but does not give nearly as much coverage as most foundations. I like the light coverage as it gives me a more natural look and feel

  Ever since I was a kid I've been using my dad's Hugo cologne. This cologne has a scent that doesn't get old. I should also mention that I own lots of colognes and this is still my favorite. Like the other reviewer said I don't think the amazon description really describes this cologne. You should just go out and try it out. Hugo boss has also came out with other colognes which I've been dissapointed about. Some are good but they can't ever beat the original hugo. Take my advice and buy Hugo

I have been mostly a Calvin Klein cologne supporter the last few years but a few months ago I gave Hugo a try.  I gotta say that I really dig it.  I don't know about it being the scent of "northern air, deep rich forests, and surf crashing against a rugged coastline", but it smells good.  And the old lady likes it.  Not to sound gay but the scent is light, not heavy like CK's Obsession, and it hangs around for a good while unlike alot of the lighter colognes that seem to disappear after a few hours.  

If you haven't tried it, you should.  You'll like it and so will the old ball and chain

Laura Mercier's Metallic Creme Eye Colour is the best eye shadow I had ever worn. I have it in Gold and will soon purchase another Gold and the Barnished Cooper. I wear this eye color every day because it lasts through out the day, no need to re-apply and no creases (which is a plus). Don't let the size or price of the tube discourage you from purchasing this product. This product should last a good six or more months depending on how much you use and you don't need to use a lot because this stuff is highly pigmented (love that). I don't regret buying it at all, it's the best creme eye shadow out there

I bought gold and alloy. It's creamy and glides on like silk and the colors are fantastic. It's also something that's great for moms because you apply it with your fingertips for some quick color- it's fast and easy.

Just a little pump of this stuff each day keeps your skin nice and clean, but not too dry. I have sensitive skin that tends to get oily--Olivella has been great. So many products overdry, not this stuff. I highly recommend it. 

By the way, my husband uses it too. We've had our bottle for 8 or 9 months--a little goes a long way, so it's pretty economical. Smells pleasant, too

I was a skeptic and not a mother, but was still told that this cream is meant for anybody with stretch marks. So I had to try this stuff out. I was so amazed that this stuff started working in a few days. When I noticed such quick fading of the stretch markes around my stomach and my shoulder joints I was impressed I could actually see normal skin, I was thrilled and have told everybody I know about this stuff. This stuff is also good for dry skin and sunburns, I had to test out the possibilities and the stuff works like magic. I don't know how they formulated this stuff but after all these years somebody finally got it right

As a rule,I never buy fragrances named after women but for Paris Hilton I make an exception - I LOVE her fragrances! They have persistent high topnotes and are long lasting. I also bought both her Colognes for Men for my husband and he loves them too! In fact he goes through his faster than I go through mine. These fragrances also make great gifts.

My boyfriend wears this cologne and I love it.  It's not too overpowering and he still smells great at the end of the day.  It has a slight vanilla scent that is not sweet but I think it's what makes the cologne "warm".  Rumor has it this scent may be discontinued, which will make us both unhappy...... I'm stocking up for him now, just in case

I really like this product and the only thing keeping me from marking it 5 stars is the fact that it makes my skin feel sticky for a while after I put it on.  The smell stays around for a long while which is great!  I reccomend this product if you like the smell of cinnamon, it's so homey and comforting!  :)

Instead of indulging in one of those fabulously aromatic concoctions of sugar, cinnamon, flour and white frosting hawked in every airport food court in the country, buy yourself a jar of this whipped body soufflÃ© that accurately mimics the irresistibility of the smell without the worry of all those extra calories or the concern that your friends may think that too much overtime has been accrued rolling out dough at the bakery.

This light emulsion goes on smooth, sinks into the skin within seconds, leaves none of the stickiness attributed to the real deal and converts into an actual perfume with cinnamon notes. Rather than doling out an overdose of cinnamon bun hot from the oven, the initial scent morphs to something light but lingering -- not cloying---you will be soft and feel as delicious and delectable as you smell. 

As I am tempted to apply it more than once a day, my only complaint may be that the jar is too small and will not last as long as I would like.

Nevertheless, Philosophy has come up with a calorie free treat that allows you to have your cake without eating it. 

Recommended to all those who like a fresh light scent that generates a warm feeling of yum.  Not recommended to those who may have extremely sensitive skin as one user that I know complained of a slight rash that appeared after using it on the skin under her arms

Great eyebrows ALONE can change your entire look. They are to your eyes what a great frame is to a Rembrant and THIS product by Laura Geller is the ULTIMATE in eyebrow perfection; a mascara for your brows that grooms, lifts, tames, colors, and--with it's marvelous tiny fibers embedded in the tint--fills in sparse, thin or thinning brows in as little time as it takes to do your lashes. I've often seen people mistaken for having their hair done or losing weight or some other major aesthetic improvement when all they did was have their eyebrows groomed--it's THAT important. THIS product replaces all the brow pencils, powders and brushes of the past and it's all you'll ever need to get those elegant, sophisticated, perfect brows seen on the glamorous actresses of the 40's and 50's films. It may take a few patient practice applications but anyone can become a expert with this product. After you've filled in and colored your brows with the color right for you, use the clear end to brush in a perfect all day hold. I recommend using a magnifying mirror while you're applying for a flawless application. As long as this product is around, I'll never be without it again

If you have any issues with hair loss or dry scalp issues, this will heal and soothe the scalp and possibly nourish the hair at the roots (I find this to be true with essential oils). 

This is the product to reach for in the dryness of winter when you are looking for just about anything to calm your scalp and keep in the moisture. The surprising aspect of this conditioning product is how deeply cleansed and nourished your scalp will feel. It also deeply moisturizes your hair like a conditioning treatment. 

One thing about this product is that it is super rich and it may take as many as four shampoos to get this out of your hair. I'd suggest trying this at night in the bath, washing it out twice and then putting your hair up for the night. That way, you don't have to worry about it until the next time you wash your hair the following day. I think of this as a sort of overnight treatment, even though I wash it out right after using it. 

This can be used as a preventative treatment once a week. Almond oil, nettle extract, rosemary, beeswax, papaya, menthol, peppermint, lavender, rose, juniper, salicylic acid make this a winner. I'll be ordering this one again!

I have fair skin and have a very hard time finding foundations that are the right the color, it seems like everything is either to dark or to yellow.  After the last two brands I used cancelled my foundation shade I finally broke down and decided I would just have to go with a more expenssive foundation.  I sales clerk at Sephora recomended Vincet Longo to me as the best foundation they carry and I am so glad she did.  I use golden porcelin if I have been in the sun lately and porcelin if I have not.  The coverage is on the sheer side, so it is not heavey or cakey.  Because it is a little bit sheer you could probably wear a shade that is not an exact match and not have that mask look.  Most people can't tell when I am wearing this foundation and when I'm not.  Usually if anyone comments on my skin while I am wearing it it is to complement my skin and ask what cleansers and lotions I have been using. In my oppinion that is the reaction a good foundation should get.  I also love that that it is SPF 15, because as fair as I am my face burns pretty easily.  The dew finish is not shiney like some some dew finishes, just not matte.  Plus it contains ceramide 3, chamomile, vitamins E and C, all of which are supposed to sooth skin, protect it and improve texture.  I was not looking for a water proof foundation, and I have not tried it while swimming so I don't know if it stays on.  I will definatly be buying more Vincent Longo products.  I just hope they don't cancel or change my shades and I have to buy an even more expensive brand of foundation

This is wonderful!  The scent is like no other.  I am so glad that I decided to experience this fragrance...it reminds me of pineapple, citrus...and other notes.  I can truly say that this has just become my signature scent.  I also purchased the Blue Orchidee which also smells wonderful.  I actually layered both scents and it just heightened my fragrance experience.  What more can I say...Wonderful!!! :-

I am in my 50's.  Throughout my life I have used many mascara's and this is the only one that doesn't give the panda eyes with a few hours.  It washes off very easily.  The only problem I have with it and it's a very minor problem is that when I put it on, no matter how careful I am I always blink and it gets on my skin (lower lid).  It also has a tendency to drop a few dust flakes which I need to remove with a q-tip.  It's true you can go swimming in it because it is not waterproof, but for everyday it's the best.

I purchased this fragrance last summer and I as well as alot of other people around me love this fragrance. It smells like a light breezy day at the beach. It is perfect for the daytime and also works well for the evening. 
If you cant stand strong fragrances this might be for you. I am a nurse at a nursing home and this does not bother my older patients at all. As they are sometimes sensitive to strong smells. 
It also last for about 4 or 5 hours which is a good thing for me

The other person who reviewed "Happy" by Clinique is incorrect. There is no musk undertone in this perfume. I know because my body chemistry brings out the musky undertones in any fragrance whatsoever, regardless of if it maybe perfume, body spray, lotions, whatever. Instead this fragrance is light and flowery with citrus undertones. Additionally, the scent lasts all evening. I can put on a light spray at the beginning of the evening, go to a smoky club with a punk rock band, drink, get in a fight, have a roll in the hay and still smell like Happy in the morning!

This is the only perfume my fiance really loves to smell, and contrary to another person's review, it lasts longer than many perfumes of the same quality and price.  Its subtle, citrus nuances make it ideal for cuddling and nibbling, especially since it won't overpower or leave any taste residue.  

Delightful

I absolutely love this perfume. Whenever I have it on people always ask me what I am wearing! It has a citrusy floral note to it so it smells crisp and clean. I wear a lot of different perfumes- but I think a bottle of this lasted me over a year (a little goes a long way.

I think I smell the citron the most in this scent. At first I thought is was similar to grapefruit and then I got the fine balance of other tones. Beautiful and light scent. Look for a good deal on it though, pricing varies greatly

        Bonanza!  Urban Decay has broken the bank - not at Monte Carlo but of makeup with the new Precious Metal Eye Sheens.  They're ultra smooth with a cream to powder formula and stay on and on and on.  A subtle glisten of metallic gives eyes a wide awake look by day and a sexy come hither gleam by night.

	The Eye Sheens come in four different shades which you can either apply simply to the corner of your eyes or smudge all over the lid.  Try "Big Thicket" for an innocent lavender, or "Loaded" for a full throttle jade.  "Platinum" is a sheer sliver of silver, and "Trust Fund" a super sapphire.

	You know what a girl's best friends are,  and these Sheens come in dazzling diamond shaped cubes.  Which is all to say these eye colors are gems.

        - Gail Cook

Ojon is a great brand for hair.  The main thing you should look out for is use very, very little of the restorative treatment...It is very oily and in turn will make your hair smooth, yes but quite oily looking.  Once you get used to how much you should use for your hair type - you will LOVE the product!  Take a chance, if you want smooth, silky hair

This is by far the best-smelling cologne i've ever purchased. Vera Wang shut alot of competition with this one because unlike many fragrances on the market today, Vera Wang for Men offers a sweet, minty, long-lasting scent that is very distinct and wearable by men of all ages. I recommend this fragrance mostly for evenings, but i'm sure any man today who cares anything about how he smells can pull it off during the day. It starts off with a thin stream of mint and amber and finishes with a touch of pine and soft julip. Great fragrance and my personal favorite, it'll leave you breathless

This fragrance has something about it that seems very addicting to wear.  It is for a distingusied and sophisticated person.  I love to wear this one when taking the wife out to eat or enjoying the evening with her.  She loves the scent on me as it last for several hours. This fine fragrance contains Green Mandarin Leaf, Yuzu, Nutmeg, Viantge Leather, Anise, Sandalwood, Tobacco.  I highly recommend this one to the distinguished man.  This one is definately a hidden treasure and when your done with the bottle I'm sure you'll hurry to get another one, like I will

I am 51 and recently visited an upscale retail store in Manhattan.  The Yves St Laurent gal behind the cosmetic counter noticed my complexion was a little sallow - put this product about an inch on each side of my nose and blended it in..what a difference it made...a worthwhile investment..I use it under my eyes and just about all over my face for a nice touch-up, concealer and brightener..covers freckles and sun spots, too

Awesome product - best concealer I've ever used.  It is lightweight and does not settle into the under eye "creases" that my almost 50-year-old eyes have.  The pink undertone brightens and lightens.

This is the BEST shampoo/body wash I have ever smelled!  I can't wait to shower - just to use this product.  I am very picky about hair products -  and this is an A++++ product. It worked well on my thick corse hair and was creamy as a body wash. The only thing missing is conditioner and lotion for after the shower!  I do like the cin buns - but this is sooooo much better!!!!!!  You MUST try this product

This is the cutest packaged eyeshadow on the market.  The brush sits down in the shadow for the perfect amount of powder gets on it.  If you don't get much shadow on the tip, just shake the bottle a little and the brush fills up with more for a more dramatic effect.  Unlike with other loose eyeshadow powders that you have to use your own brush with, this doesn't get too much on the brush or your eyelid and it's easy to layer.  It has a fantastic shimmer to it and each color looks good on my skin color (which is REALLY RARE with most cosmetics)  I can't tell you how much I love this stuff!  So go ahead and buy it, and don't forget to shake the bottle with the cap on and brush in each time you apply so that the powder re-dispursts in the bottle.  :

I'm always skeptical of "age defying" products, but this one really works.  I've been using it since it first came out (maybe 10 years?) and people often think I'm younger than I am (27).  I'm not really using it for that though - I use it because it is unreal how good it is with acne.  It prevents breakouts and also heals current pimples SO fast.  When I run out, the breakouts are back

I recommend this product its great and long lasting, but the only thing I didn't like about it was that at the end of the day it started flaking a little bit. Other than that its one of the best mascaras on the market

For the past several years, I've been using mineral powders on my sensitive, acne-prone face instead of liquid makeup. I liked some better than others, but then I tried this powder from Clinique. It's fantastic! Seems more natural than any other makeup I've tried, and it can go from extremely sheer to as much coverage as you could possible want, by just adding more.

I love it

I agree with everyone!! It feels as if you're not wearing any make-up. Also it is the best powder/foundation for everyday use. I hate wearing foundation since it almost always feels that I am wearing a mask. But this is the total opposite. Also make sure you get the right shade. I recommend trying 2-3 of their shades to see which one suits you. This is a definitely a MUST HAVE

This new compact base by Clinique is THE BEST face makeup - liquid or powder - I've EVER tried.  And believe me - I've tried bazillions of them (even pricier brands)!  It covers amazingly well.  My face tends toward redness, so I got a yellow based shade (104) and it evens out my skin perfectly while covering all redness.  It goes on like an ever-so-slightly creamy powder and is SUPER EASY to apply with no goofs.  It manages NOT to look powdery on, although basically matte in nature.  It mimics perfect skin.  I went out with friends last night with this stuff on and they kept complimenting my skin!  I told them it was this makeup and they were surprised I had makeup on at all.  Kudos to Clinique for coming up with wearable, PERFECT skin!  A dream come true!  Comes in a pretty (although not particularly cute or memorable,) nice quality compact with separate sponge compartment and a good quality sponge

I've tried a lot of compacts to find that combination of coverage yet natural looking.  Before Clinique's Perfectly Real Compact, I used Bare Minerals.  In order to get the coverage I wanted, it took a long time and after couple applications with the brush my skin started to dry out and saw little bits of flake.  
With the Clinique compact, it's quick and totally natural looking with great coverage.  I use the sponge in the areas where I need a little bit more coverage and then use a brush for the rest of my face.  It's really great.  My face doesnt look like makeup is caked on.  
But WARNING; if you DO NOT know your color, I recommend going to a couple different department stores and getting consultations about the perfect color for your skin.  When I went to find the color of my compact, I got recommendations ranging from 104 to 116. Some workers really don't know what they're talking about. I ended up buying 106 and this one worker recommended 116, which is a HUGE difference. Really try to find the perfect color because your skin will look more natural and money and time wouldn't be wasted

Since Marshall Fields had a gift with purchase for Clinique, I ran right out and got this today. I was able to find my exact skin color match in shade 114(N). My skin is fair with yellow undertones. This went on smoothly and silkly with no powder streaks/marks as I seem to get with other powder foundations. This foundation has no smell and I feel like I have nothing on my face. I think they have a winner here with this foundation!

Karma smells just like a head shop to me. You have to decide for yourself if that floats your boat or not. The powder smells even more delicious than the perfume. My only problem with it is the texture. It's slightly gritty. I wish they would fix that. It may sound strange, but also, if you use the powder in white undies, it will color them orange..

I love Karma. It's one of my favorite scents. I smell more orange and gardenia than I do patchouli, though. It's a very sweet, vibrant scent, without being too sweet and candy-like. I have had no problems with it being gritty or anything like that. I use a powder puff I bought for it, so there have been no problems applying it. I just love this stuff, and it goes further for the money than the soap does, too

I wear the scent all the time and people compliment me on it. To the lady who stated that the scent is faint and she has to scramble for another perfume, maybe it the scent just doesn't mesh well with her.

It's not interesting enough that it would be my signature fragrance, but it's great for casual, everyday wear. The scent is light, flirty, but never overpowering. I REALLY recommend the body lotion. It makes my skin so soft and leaves a subtle glittery shimmer that lasts all day

This is the best hair care product for naturally curly hair...I was so bummed when the company discontinued "curly head"...I have spent thousands(LITERALLY) on hair care stylers,conditioners, etc...it leave curls defined, hair frizz fear, smells great and it is so light! I do not even use conditioner or any other styling product when I use this...just shampoo and a few drops(I comb through) and air dry....hear it is great on straight hair too

personally my hair is curly super thick and always ends up dry or undefined or fluffy or frizzy or hard stiff and sticky from products and never gets defined with other serums...but not this one! I know it is expensive and wish the amount was bigger but it is worth its weight!!!

This is truly the best in highlighting products and I have tried many high end and cheaper products out there.  This is so light and just doesn't get all cakey and greasy.  I have tried so many brands that claim to look natural, but they just don't.  This really does and don't let the price fool you either.  It only takes alittle and lasts a long time, so well worth the price for the look it gives.  I love this!

I am 51 and recently visited an upscale retail store in Manhattan.  The Yves St Laurent gal behind the cosmetic counter noticed my complexion was a little sallow - put this product about an inch on each side of my nose and blended it in..what a difference it made...a worthwhile investment..I use it under my eyes and just about all over my face for a nice touch-up, concealer and brightener..covers freckles and sun spots, too

I couldn't disagree more with the previous revue.  I've been using the original StriVectin-SD for almost a year and have been very pleased with the results.  No, all my lines did not disappear but they have gotten noticably reduced as evidenced by the comments I've gotten from friends and coworkers.  My only problem with the original formula was that it irritated my eyes.  I was very pleased to discover that StriVectin had already come out with an eye cream to combat this very problem.  It is exactly the same as the original formula except it does not contain the mint extract as that is what was causing people to have adverse reactions around the eye area.  So now I start with the StriVectin-SD Eye Cream around my eyes and crowsfeet then I apply original Strivectin-SD to the rest of my face and I'm set.  No more eye irritation and my skin looks great

A short history!! The House of Creed is one of the oldest perfume manufacturers in the world and was founded in 1760 by James Henry Creed. The House of Creed quickly became a favorite among the English Court and Queen Victoria appointed the House of Creed the official perfume supplier. The House of Creed also became popular with other royals too!

Alright, so Himalya was created for men. I'm a woman and have  fallen in love with this classic scent and enjoy wearing it myself. Himalaya is one of my personal favorites made by the House of Creed (however I'm pretty partial too all the scents created for both men &amp; women by the House of Creed). 

According to the descriptions I've found, Himalaya is a blend of mandarin, grapefruit, sandalwood, cedarwood, amber, pepper and tonka musk. I feel Himalaya has a rich, smooth, classic scent that will never go out of style. This fragrance is concentrated, so a little goes a long way and the scent lasts a long time without having to be re-applied. I have received plenty of compliments on this fragrance when I've worn it

Well I love the scent, and it makes the skin soft, reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish the scent was a bit stronger to where I could smell it without putting My nose to the skin.  I will buy it again, just wish they'd make the scent more appearent.

The Silk Elixir is a great leave-in conditioner.  It does not weigh down my curls or leave any kind of residue.  It has UV protection, which is a bonus.  It makes my hair soft and my curls smooth.  It is a little expensive, but a little bit of product goes a long way

I really like the Hard Candy Lip Gloss Ring! 

Fist off, the cute packaging makes it both fun and easy to wear (I like clunky things like that). The ring fits my finger, which is about a size 6.5/7 or so.

Secondly, the actual gloss is pretty good. However, that's also the reason why I only gave it four stars. The gloss doesn't last that long, and certainly doesn't taste that good. It isn't extremely shiny, however it is pretty moisturizing.

All in all, I recomend this as a cute gift topper or stocking stuffer for anyone who wears lip gloss or cute rings like this. I personally think it's worth it just for the container, but the actual gloss is nothing to write home about

I wasn't sure how I would fare with this product, but I am so glad I tried it! Here's a tip: I used first aid tape (the fabric kind, not the kind with really sticky adhesive) and I taped the stencil onto my brow. It took a little maneuvering to position the stencil at just the right place, but I taped the stencil down and brushed the powder on. Then I did the other eye. I  recommend using the stencils on both sides first and then doing the plucking, because I tried plucking right after removing the stencil on the first side, and I actually overplucked a tiny bit. (I was able to mask the almost indetectable difference in the two sides this morning when I put my makeup on by using just a teeny bit of the brown powder and the wax...I live in Texas and even in the humidity the powder stayed put and did not smudge!) Overall, this is not a snap to use, but definitely worth the effort, and I even got compliments on my brows from my coworkers who thought I had had them done professionally. I bought this kit for the price of having my brows waxed twice at a salon. I am very happy with the purchase and would highly recommend it

After spending a good hour playing with Anastasia's eyebrow colors at Sephora, I decided to give it a go and bought the Brunette ex-press kit. The colors are a bit dark for my golden, med brown hair, but if you go lightly, it looks better. I had bought her tweezers a month before and could not stop raving about how great there were compared to my tweezermans. So, her signature eyebrows color had to be just as good or at least almost as good as the real thing (Anastasia, herself). The Stencils were intimidating at first, I had to take a deep breath before plucking the hair outside the stencil outline. But once I was done, my eyebrows looked great! Like a mini-eyebrow lift; couldn't believe how much removing hairs from my already sparse eyebrows, could look better. Worth the buy

After months of wanting, I finally ordered it.  I am brunette, but ordered the blonde coloring as I have very fair skin and light eyes.  Glad I did!  The darker of the blonde colors was perfect, any darker and it would have looked fake.  It's a little awkward using the stencils, but I managed fine.  Try them all out- the first three were never going to work on me, the last one I tried was a near perfect fit.  

I love the finished look- I didn't have a lot to pluck, but now my eyebrows look much neater.  My hair grayed very early in life, and now my stupid brows have gray and white hairs running through them- the powder covers that up nicely.  I didn't realize how aging my brows were to my face till I used this!

My only gripe is there is very little information with the kit- just minimal instructions on the back of the small box.  The website had a little more detail, and a few photos.  I could find no help with color choice- for the high price, I would hate to goof and get the wrong coloring for my skin type.  I am glad I went with the blonde

I saw her on Oprah and immediately wanted this kit for my unruly, thick brows. I have always struggled to maintain a nice arched shape and always mess up the plucking of my brows. It is a bit difficult to use the plastic shapers by myself, but they have helped me a lot to see the correct shape to pluck. The shading powder is really helpful for shaping too. It's a sleek little compact kit and has helped me with at home maintenance

This product is good. The only problem is that the eyebrow tint looks kind of weird on the part where you don't have eyebrows. I only use it when I am putting on a lot of makeup, otherwise it looks kind of fake for everyday use. The coloring is really good for blondes

I, too, was an unbeliever.  After 29 years of Erno Laszlo products for my oily skin, my complexion is quite good. I haven't even tried a moisturizer of any kind for over 20 years.  Creme de la Mer is a revelation. It's not too heavy or oily for my skin, it heals OVERNIGHT those pesky little "bumps" that still pop up from time to time, and I love how it makes my face look! People guessed my age 10 years less before I used this product, now . . . they will never believe the truth

Ive tried all the supposed best of the moment,breakthrough skin care,anti-aging,anti-wrinkle products in the past 5 yrs,and I just keep going back to La Mer.I use other products for at least six months to reap their full benefits,and honestly,my skin looks its most radiant and best when Im back with La Mer.I just stopped trying out other products now since its only La Mer that brings the best results.My skin always looks radiant and dewey.In terms of wrinkle improvement,there will only be a cosmetic change due to the fact that your skin will look moist,which lessens the appearance of lines.Lines are pronounced when skin is dry,thus all moisturizers work on keeping the skin moist which gives you the illusion of less lines.But this product is truly the best among all!!!Nothing else

Yes, it is about $100 for an ounce, but that should last you a few months... and this stuff really is amazing. I find it so funny that so many reviews obsess about how expensive this is. Yes, it cost more than a lot of creams, but $100 every few months for glowing skin is NOT much in my book. No one complains when people spend that much on their hair, and dinner with wine at a good restaurant is more expensive! I think my face is worth it. Be sure to use the spatula, and warm it between your fingers prior to application

I was the kid who had horrible acne as a teenager and mild scarring as an adult. My hormones went wild after my daughter was born and this stuff was a miracle!  The texture of my skin is perfect. I have people constantly say how gorgeous my skin is- then I have to confess that it's completely the La Mer. WELL worth the money- the 1 oz lasts about four months so really you're not paying anymore than you would for Clinique etc that doesn't get the job done. Invest in La Mer, give it a few months, and you'll have amazing skin

There is NO better shampoo that I've tried for adding volume than Kerastase Resistance. It also strengthens baby-fine hair. You will have amazing volume but it won't dry your hair. This is without a doubt the best volumizing shampoo of any I have ever tried

So many volumizing shampoos just leave fine hair limp; this manages to both soften hair and give it fullness at the same time.  I'm not a fan of spending this much on a product but when something works so well, it's worth coming back to.  It doesn't take much to get great cleaning; the volume and shine are wonderful.  Well worth the price!

My daughters and I have naturally curly hair and this stuff is a life saver. It gives shine, and hold without stiffness. It creates very soft looking curls. The only thing is a little goes a long way. It can give a greasy appearance if you put too much, or put it to close to your scalp. We usually go down about an inch from our roots. It also leaves your hair touchable without that gross grimy feeling on your hands.

I've tried a lot of hair products to tame my very huge and very thick, natural afro, and CD's Mimosa Hair Honey is one of my favorites. I use it as a sheen for my natural curls as well as to balance my dry scalp. It's a little thick, but if you have very course &amp; dry hair, then this product is definitely what you need.

If you're like me and your scalp itches like crazy after you get your color done, Nioxin System Scalp Therapy is the answer. (The numbers only represent the type of hair you have, use a lower number if your hair is more fine.)

Use this once or two times after color, and the scalp itch goes away. 

The product claims to help thinning hair. I have no issue with that, and I think I found an "off-market" use for the product, but it works for me so I'll take it

I've been using this product for over 2 years now.  Non-greasy formula and does not burn if you get it in your eyes.  A little goes a long way.  No scrubbing needed.  Great product for the money.

I usually use the "New! (hair)" shampoo bar but decided to try this one during a recent online shopping spree on Lush's site.  I LOVE the smell, the scent seems to linger in my hair all day whereas the "New!" shampoo bar doesn't so much and my hair did seem a bit more manageable and soft after use that what it is normally so I would most definitely recommend it!  I will likely stick with my "New!" shampoo primarily but will order this again in the future for sure

If you haven't tried a solid shampoo before, you definitely should! Great for camping, travelling, bringing to the gym, or just using as an everyday shampoo. To cut down on bringing a whole bag full of bath products to the gym, I use this as a shampoo AND soap, and it works wonderfully for both purposes.

This shampoo leaves my hair FAR less tangled than most shampoos I use, so if you don't often have to use conditioner, you probably won't need it if you use this shampoo! 

The smell, of course, is grand - if you've smelled other karma-scented products from Lush, you'll know this. It's a unisex kind of scent, so I have to fight over it with my husband when we travel. MUCH better than those little bottles of foul-smelling shampoo and bath gel you get at most hotels. The earthy, citrusy smell of lemongrass, orange, lavendar, and pine is a wonderful way to wake up in the morning.

If you go to a Lush store, you can usually get a free tin to store your shampoo bars in if you buy 2 bars

This is my all time favorite of the LUSH line!  The scent is hard to describe.. and I wasn't too crazy about it when I first bought it, but it has come to be one of my most favorite scents!  I'm hooked!  This is also the only shampoo that the smell stays in your hair ALL day, even after using Conditioner.. It's so light and fresh..  simply amazing.

This shampoo is amazing.  A rub of the bar over your hands or at the roots of your hair and you have a head of lather.  Far, far better than I expected.  And  someone always comments on the smell of my hair.  Leaves your tresses soft even without a conditioner.  Give it a try; you'll love it

I'm a recent convert to Lush products and I have to say I'm thrilled to find this new shampoo. 

I started using this a couple of days ago and I've noticed a positive difference in my hair. My hair wasn't a total mess using silicone shampoos, but now that I've changed brands I can see the potential my hair had and I didn't even know it. 

I have shoulder length really thick hair with a few waves and curls. I don't have too much of a problem with tangling to begin with. All I needed was a couple of swipes down my hair and this will lather right up. It smells awesome in the shower. Lush describes it as oranges in a bowl of spices; I'm not so sure about that but it definately smells kind of foresty and nice. It rinsed off very well with hot water and I followed with Jungle conditioner. 

Hours later in the day I can stil smell Komba shampoo wafting around my head. It's amazing. I've never had a shampoo stick with me like this and my hair feels light and shiny and just clean. No matter how much I try to clean regular shampoo from my hair it seems to weigh it down. My boyfriend mentioned today my hair looked much less "poofy". This is just amazing. 

I would reccomend keeping the shampoo in an airtight container. Keeping it on a shelf where any water will hit it will deteriorate its longevity. I keep mine in a very tiny tupperwear container in the shower. The size of the bar is small, but it will go a loooooong way.

I am a new convert to LUSH products having stumbled upon them while at the Orlando airport. This is the first solid shampoo I have used and I really like this one. It lathers really nice and smells fantastic! It leaves my hair feeling full and shiny and better than any bottled shampoo I have ever used. My hair feels clean but not stripped and that is important since I color it. I am looking forward to trying the others and a conditioner as well. I am completely impressed with all the LUSH products I have tried and am looking forward to giving LUSH for Christmas

For a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is MAC. Lipglass feels good on your lips, as if it contained some emollients. And (this is a big AND) it's not tacky or sticky. 

The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. 

Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. 

Enjoy!

MAC LipGlass is the absolute best. There are plenty of colors to choose from, SUPER-Shiny, and the gloss is thick, stays on and doesn't run. 
The best colors are....
NICO for a cute lavender pink color with a glittery shine. 
OYSTERGIRL is a shimmery baby pink.
OH BABY is the perfect gloss for any earth toned lipstick.
CHAI looks amazing with black smokey eyes. It's the perfect neutral earthy gloss and has no glitter or shimmer - just pure shine

I'm REALLY anal about scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored with vanilla, but MAC LipGlass isn't that vanilla-ish at all!  It's got very pigmented color, it stays on a LONG time for a gloss, and each tube lasts a long time...  Don't let what the other reviewer said about the vanilla scent throw you off

I bought a Fantasy gift set (fragrance, body soufflÃ© &amp; jewellery box), and wasn't really interested in the soufflÃ©. I have sensitive skin &amp; suffer from migraines, so have to be careful about which products I use.

But curiosity got the better of me, so I gave it a try. The non-shimmering lotion melted into my skin immediately - no stinging or rashes.

 The FANTASY scent - chocolate, cupcake, lychee, quince and kiwi - is subtle enough not to overpower me, yet strong enough to have people comment on my wonderful fragrance. (The scent of the fruity ingredients seemed to last longer on me, but then again everybody is different).

The body soufflÃ© can be worn on it's own on subtler days, or layered with the fragrance for a longer lasting impression.

These are the replacement sponges for the Dermanew system. Each sponge includes a foam top section that comes in contact with your skin and a plastic bottom section that snaps securely on to your Dermanew applicator.

The sponges are very effective at applying the Dermanew dermabrasion creams. Very gentle on the skin with just the right amount of pressure. Each one also lasts a long time if you clean it after each use. But because of wear and tear and bacterial growth they should be replaced periodically.

The Dermanew system is great!(See my review on it) The sponges are excellent. However, I deducted one star because I feel $4.00 is pricey for the item.

I went to Sephora looking for a high quality bubble bath and the associate recommended Deep Steep and promised "movie star bubbles."  She was right!  I went back to get more (several months later), and Sephora no longer carries this brand.  Luckilly, I found it here.  The bubbles and the fragrance are long lasting, with no harsh chemicals or greasy residue left in the bathtub.  The fragrance is nice but not overhwelming.  The bubbles are full and lasting...they won't end up in a mound at your feet.  Somehow, they're distributed all throughout the bath water...just waiting for you to slide in!
You don't need to use a lot of bubblebath, which is good..because of the  price....but even with a small amount, you'll have a tub full of bubbles!!!  Enjoy!!

Perfect for touch-ups throughout the party season!

The best selling fragrance; the sweetness of chocolate and cupcake, before settling with fruity scents of lychee, quince and kiwi. The base note of vanilla lingers throughout making FANTASY a truly delicious classic in the making!

The gloss; Despite its greenish colour it is clear &amp; shimmery!!

Never mind the party season - this is a handbag must have all year round!!!

I'm 36 ,light normal/oily skin, freckles due to past sun damage . I've tried many other products (Neutrogena copper serum, did nothing, olay, did nothing, l'oreal, nothing or takes a lot of weeks and money to start working)so I decided to give this serum a try and I loved it! I've been using it for a year, every night and my skin has changed a lot,it looks fresh,healthier of course you have to have a routine :clean,exfoliate and moisture, but it's worth every penny! I highly recommended it

It's hard to find the perfect skin products, but this one is flawless in my opinion. It's not heavy or greasy and goes on the skin just perfectly. I tend to have sensitive/combination skin and now use this treatment everyday. I strongly recommend it

I started using Face Oasis when H2O Plus first opened its stores.  There are two specific reasons why I continue to use it.  I am sensitive to most cosmetic product smells and perfumes - it has its own unique "light" smell, but it certainly does not make my eyes water - and its ability to be absorbed by the skin without leaving a residue, or greasy feeling. Some skin products (some very expensive ones)have left my face dried out even though labeled as "moisturizers". Face Oasis has this wonderful 'cool' feeling to it.  A $34.00 jar lasts 3 months - do the math.  Some over the counter skin products cost over $9.00 and Face Oasis and H2O Plus products on the whole, are fiscally sound purchases for those looking for a bargain

 I have dry skin, this moisturizer worked so well when I used it in my 20s, I felt my skin being hydrated instantly after putting it on my face. However, after i reached 30s, it's no longer good enough for my skin. If you have very oily skin (or outer oily, inner dry), it would be a very good moisturizer for you.

I have another Fekkai product, and loved it so much I wanted to take a look at what else dear Frederic had to offer.  I've always wanted a product that would put waves in my hair, but every one I tried before just made my hair stiff, crunchy, and icky looking!  I read good reviews about this product, so I decided to give it a try.  It amazed me!  My hair really doesn't have much natural wave- maybe one or two semi-waves in the back.  Frankly, if I leave my hair air-dry without doing anything to it, it looks like cave-woman hair!  But not with this stuff!  I towel dried my hair until it was just damp.  Then I sprayed it all over my hair, flipped my head over and scrunched. (If your hair tends to get frizzy, you may want to add a little cream- such as Fekkai glossing cream- as this product doesn't do much to combat frizz)  Then I blow-dryed on low for just a minute or two while scrunching, and let the rest air-dry.  I have a few pieces of hair in the front that is quite damaged from coloring, and the waves weren't that defined there.  But the rest of my hair- wow!  I never imagined having such fun waves with my relatively straight hair!  Frederic Fekkai is a genius!

This liner is thin as advertised, goes on easy, stays, and is really nice stuff.  Be warned, though, the lightest shade is REALLY light, and only good if you're REALLY pale.  It barely shows on me - I'm really pale with strawberry blonde hair and even I should've gone darker on the color.  Recommended

It is amazing! I didn't believe it at first until my friend showed me how to use it. I cannot believe how it stays on all day. Completely accentuates and lengthens my lashes. I curled them first and then applied Fiberwig, my lashes were up the entire day, they never came down. Probably because of how light it is, it is not heavy at all. My lashes look totally natural...and the best part...when I washed it off at the end of the night, it was sooooo easy to remove! It never smudged...not during the day or even after I washed them off. I absolutely love it

I'm on my second day of using this mascara and I think it's love. I wear contacts and this stuff doesn't irritate my eyes at all! My lashes look so much longer and thicker and it doesn't flake or smudge. Plus, it comes off easily with my makeup towelette at night.

Word to the natural girls - this is not a mascara for you my nuetral, peach gloss loving friend. This is pumped-up, girly-girl, make-up faced stuff. If you're in the mood for a little drama, try it. You'll love it

I got it, and I love it. Simple as that. I was a little suprised that there wasn't much lather, but it does get my very thick hair clean. Upon further thought I took to reading the ingredients again, and it's mostly all natural stuff. Kinda makes on wonder what is in the Rx bought stuff???
Try it, yes, it fragrant but I like it. However, it could be overpowering for some,especially if you are over sensitive to sents

When I first tried this bar, my hair did feel very conditioned, but I didn't realize it was a 2 in 1 bar, so I used American Cream conditioner too. They do work very well together, but you can probably get away with just the shampoo bar. I was amazed at how much fun it was to use the shampoo bars, except you do have to keep them out of the shower or in a shampoo bar tin. 

If you are in love with the Flying Fox shower gel and temple balm, this may be the one you want. The ingredient list is impressive: Hibiscus Extreact, Shea Butter, Camellia Oil, Jojoba Oil, Macadamia Nut Oil, Coconut Butter, Jasmine, Ylang Ylang Oil, Cypress Oil, Palmarosa Oil and even a few little jasmine flowers just for fun. I loved this bar almost as much as Trichomania, also with coconut. 

I'm wondering if having hard water makes a difference when using the shampoo bars. I bought a shower filter and haven't noticed any problems with anything I've tried so far.

I travel a lot, and yes I only take one carry-on bag, with the new restrictions I tried this shampoo, I have a LOT of Hair, it's colored and is veeeerrrryyy  choosy about shampoos, so is my scalp (overly sensitive and does itch if I use the wrong product) ..... so I always travel with my own bottle never trusting the hotels tiny punny bottle, 

I was a little skeptical since it's not really that big (smaller than a regular bar of soap) I have been using it a week, my hair is manageble, no tangles, and oh so shinny , soft and NO itchy scalp !!!  I wet my hair wet the bar and 4 nice big circles over my shoulder lenght hair and taddaaa  suds, and yes I agree the smell is a little overpowering but hey, I can't take my perfume with me, the soft aroma that lingers in my hair will have to do...

I was skeptical at first.  I mean, a shampoo/conditioner bar?  I haven't been super impressed with Lush's other solid shampoos or conditioners (at least, not enough to write a review, good or bad), so I was doubtful about this 2-in-1 bar.  But I loved the idea, and I was curious, so I bought it and I must say that Godiva far surpassed my hopes!

My hair is about shoulder length, and it only took about 6 or 7 good swipes on wet hair to work up an incredible lather! (3 or 4 swipes wasn't enough, and 10 was too much!)

My hair felt clean, but not that styrofoam-squeaky clean where *everything* is stripped from your hair.  And the conditioner is light, but doesn't really kick in until your hair dries.  I don't personnally recommend using a hair dryer, so I don't know how that would affect the conditioner, but air drying has worked great for me.

I also recommend it for travel since it's about the size of your palm, is 2-in-1, and won't leak!  

(The only warning I'd give is for the shampoo tin.  I got it for free, so maybe I shouldn't complain, but... let the shampoo bar dry before putting it into the tin!!!  It is a PAIN to get it out if you don't.)

I also LOVE the scent, but could be too strong for some people (or not strong enough).  Everyone is different, but if you don't live near a Lush store, you'll never know until you buy it!  :

After years of relying on other people's opinions about products, Godiva is the one that finally inspired me to write.  If your idea of heaven is rocking on a sunny veranda with a glass of iced tea in one hand and a good book in the other, a ceiling fan spinning overhead and the heady scent of jasmine filling the air...you will love this product.

Not only does Godiva leave my hair smelling wonderful, it also leaves it shiny and full of body.  Because my hair is very long, I do use some conditioner on the ends of my hair.

Godiva is paradise in a bar...and it's much less expensive than a trip to the islands

I've been using this shampoo/conditioner in one for a month or so now.  I have color-treated otherwise normal hair that is wavy and prone to frizz.  This bar is great because it lasts FOREVER - as i said, I've owned it for a month but it still looks brand new!  A little bit goes a long way...I lather my hands with it (as if I was washing my hands) then distribute evenly throughout my hair.  Lots of lather!!!

The smell is amazing: jasmine mixed with ylang-ylang.  I wouldn't recommend this product to those who don't like strong-smelling products, or to those who don't like essential oil type scents (you know who you are). 

I feel as this shampoo (along with all lush hair products) results in hair that dries quicker.  I reccommend that you blow-dry shortly after washing if you don't drip dry.  

As far as a all in one product, I still use a seperate conditioner - but that's just me, and that goes for all brands.

This rejuvenates hair, and makes it SHINY!!

I've been using this product for years.  Every now and then I try another product in hopes of finding something a little cheaper.  I have NEVER found anything that comes close to this one.  
I'm over forty, but still have somewhat oily skin, and get breakouts on occasion.  IF I use this two to three times per week, I definitely notice that I have fewer breakouts.  My skin is smoother and more even.
I like the menthol feel.  I don't smell it at all, and find it refreshing.  I've also tried the 7-day scrub and don't find it to come close to this product.  The grains in the 7-day scrub are few and far between.  With the exfoiliating scrub, they are very concentrated.  Too much?  Just add a little water.
I only hope that Clinique doesn't stop making this

I don't know why so many reviews say they get six or seven shaves. Aren't you using hot shaving soap? I have an average European beard. I shave in the shower each day with mug soap and a bristle brush.  That is the key.  I get a good hot lather going. The lather is just to keep your whiskers wet and soft. Using a Merkur blade, I get well over fifteen or twenty shaves....or more. I don't really keep count, but one blade lasts me at least four weeks, and I shave daily. I reluctantly change blades when it seems it is a bit dull..But I think I could use it much longer...Honest. I can't imagine spending three dollars for a multiblade razor good for seven days.  Love my Merkur razor, too

This is the first double edge blade I used in my Merkur safety razor &amp; for me they work alot better than the other ones mentioned above.
I usually get 5 to 7 days per one blade. I have found that the Feather brand DE blades to be the sharpest of all I have tried but they do not seem to last as long

I was timid to use my Merkur razor for the first time, and was very careful around my neck. A week or so after starting I feel like a pro. These razors are very sharp and keep their edge for at least six or seven shaves. It truly doesn't even feel like I'm shaving, the cut is so effortless

If you let your beard grow a few days between cuttings like I do you need to use these blades.  They will cut through heavy hair with one or two passes.  They will not nick or cut if you are careful.  Then I use my regular razor with the 5 blades in it, I think it's called the fusion, and I don't have to shave for 3 days and my face stays hair free

I stumbled upon this shower gel collection this past Christmas season. I knew right away this would be a perfect solution for a lot of holiday gifts on my list. I was pleased that I could knock off a number of ladies off of my list with one purchase. I was even happier with the free shipping and $30 Amazon gift card offer they had going on at the time. 

I couldn't wait for the package to arrive. I ripped into it as soon as it got to me. The gels were all packed nicely in a sturdy box with handle from Philosophy. I had to restrain myself from keeping all of the gels. I managed to give away nine of them after some agonizing deliberation. (The mint chocolate chip, lemon custard, and berry ones were mine.) Plus the cool box made a perfect container for all of my other gels that I rotate according to season.

I'm a big fan of most of Philosophy's products. They have some awesome smelling shower gels as well as wonderfully working skincare products. I was already familar with the excellent cinnamon buns and double cocoa scents so I figured most of these should be pretty darn good too. The mint chocolate chip is nice but the lemon custard is weaker smelling out of the bottle. As with all of their 3-in-1s,Oh well, some will be a hit where as others will miss.

As with all of their 3-in-1s, the shower gel makes mounds of lather, cleans your skin usually without drying, and works fairly well as a shampoo too - though conditioner is typically needed. I like the shower gels a lot. I know my gal pals enjoyed their Christmas gift too. All things considered, this was a fantastic deal!

The fragrances are marvelous, yet after the shower they do not interfere with your scent of choice. I find the shower gel is very creamy and not drying at all. I do use it as well as a shampoo, but have found in the dry harsh winter I still need a conditioner. I highly recommend this product

This little tool really does help.  It gets blackheads out especially well.  The lancet is O.K., but not as sharp as it could be.  Still, be careful with it!  You're still poking your face!  

Another note: Tweezerman is a good company to buy from- very socially and environmentally responsible.  The company thats sells it through Amazon is good, too.  Prompt, and includes little candies in the box

Okay, so 80 bucks seems like a lot of money to plunk down for an at-home microdermabrasion kit...especially when everyone from Homedics to L 'Oreal is marketing a more cost-friendly version of what appears to be the same EXACT thing.  However, experience (and lots of money not-so-well spent) has taught me that, in most cases, you generally get what you pay for.  Case in point: a few months ago I finally made the decision to trade in my 99 cent ultra-black mascara for a high-end name brand version of the same product...I immediately discovered that mascara-induced racoon eyes really can be avoided!  Who knew?  After that, I vowed never to pinch pennies when it comes to beauty.  Now there are, of course, some exceptions; my mother swears by Oil of Olay -as do I- but when you're talking about microderabrasion, a proceedure that can cost as much as $150 per session, it's hard to believe that you can achieve the same exact results with something that is a mere fraction of the cost.

Skeptical but desperate for youthful looking skin, I opted to splurge on the DermaNew Facial Rejuvenation System.  Prior to my purchase, I did a fair amount of research so I knew that what I was getting the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of the more than twenty-plus versions that I had to choose from.  

Just two weeks after using it, I began to notice that my once sallow complexion (thanks to stress, lack of sleep and yo-yo dieting) had been replaced with a healthy glow.  Now my skin looks soft and peachy, kind of like it did when I was twelve...you know, when youth and beauty was effortless...sigh!  

All in all this product is best for someone with little to no skin flaws.  Those who are expecting miracle results or results similar to what you would get from a full-service salon treatment may be dissapointed.  My advice, shell out the necessary funds in order to get your skin under control, then use this product for the upkeep.  This is great for removing the dead skin that regular washing tends to leave behind.

At first I was hesitant to ante up the $ to purchase the dermanew system, but after a few friends raved about it, I decided to buy it.

The system includes a battery operated applicator tool (batteries are included), sponge tops for the tool, and dermabrasion cream.

You pop a sponge on top of the applicator, put cream on it and apply to your dampened skin. I set a timer for 3 minutes and work the applicator around the surface of my skin. 

The results are great! Dead skin is sloughed off, circulation is stimulated and the results are glowing soft skin.
My skin looks lovely and feels smooth to the touch. It felt soft and wonderful after the very first application!

Dermanew sells other applicator sponges and creams separately to use with the applicator tool on your hands and feet.

Though the initial price tag seems high, this tool will last for years and help you to glowing skin! I highly recommend it

The entire line is fabulous, but the rose zircon lip gloss is by far the best. I have never been one to wear lipstick, but since I first tried this lip plumping gloss, I rearly leave home without it.  It doesn't feel like you are wearing anything, yet it stays on while eating and drinking. The rose zircon matches my lips and that of all my friends who have borrowed it and not returned it because they love it so. It just makes me feel glamorous

I started with a regular hair towel by Aquis, then received the turban as a gift.  Both are great, but the turban stays on better, as it can twist to fasten at the nape of the neck.  The products are super-absorbant and make blow-drying much faster.  I've tried the generic brand, but it can't compare to this.  I use it after every shower.  A must-have

The emotionally healing benefits of orange oil and lavender become immediately apparent when you apply this to your scalp. If you can find someone to give you a head massage with this product, then you can truly relax. If applying this yourself, it works well as an at home hair treatment to nourish the hair follicles and promote healthy hair growth. You will also notice your hair becoming stronger and retaining a much deeper shine. The essential oils in this product help to activate micro-circulation which may cause a slight tingling and warming of the scalp. Leave this in for about 5-10 minutes and then wash your hair as normal. You may find you need less conditioner when using this product. Many hairdressers will use this product when giving a conditioning head massage and that is where I first found out about this product. I bought my first bottle the day I had the massage. I was that impressed and I keep buying this product.

I LOVE this foundation. I have Warm Sand Moisture Rich Foundation. It is incredibly smooth, long wearing and the color makes my skin look bright and radiant. Bobbi Brown makes very natural foundation colors and there is a range of colors for all different skin tones. When I'm shopping it seems that most lines cater to lighter and medium skin tones, but Bobbi Brown really does come through with flattering options for all skin tones. The only draw back is that this foundation does not provide adequate SPF protection, even though it says SPF 15. Therefore, you will still need to wear a sunscreen underneath of at least SPF 15. I use this foundation every day and I wear sunscreen from Paula's Choice (which I love). I think that the color options available, the long lasting color and the smooth texture make this foundation worth the price.

I have used this product for the past 16 years. It is wonderful!The Super Double Face Powder is actually a foundation and matte powder all rolled into one product. The product comes with an application sponge, goes on dry, gives superb coverage! I don't even use my Clinique concelar when I wear this product, it is that good! This product works best with those individuals who have normal or combination skin.

The smell is the only caveat for me, it's a little bit sour/bitter/funky smelling. Another thing that I find strange is I have to use alot of this to feel like I've saturated my skin. I go through it pretty quickly compared to other spray type toners. The whole Hauschka regimen is so amazing for my skin. To use, spritz on after cleansing and press gently into the skin

I was skeptical at first.  The only beer I ever drink is pale and icy on a hot, HOT day.  But my skin is terribly sensitive and 99% of shampoos make my scalp scream and my face blotchy.  So I was willing to try anything, especially from LUSH, because all of their products are of such high quality.  Last time I visited their shop, I bought the 8 oz bottle of this because it didn't have anything that I knew I was allergic to in it.

Over three months later now, and I'm still using it.  I've even come to like the smell.  And I only have to use a scalp treatment shampoo (Nizoral or Meted, which are great for the scalp but hard on the hair) maybe once a week for maintenence.  I can wear black and not have to shake my shirt off every 10 minutes.  There are no painful lesions hiding under my hair.  And the couple of people who have noticed the scent have enjoyed it and had a good chuckle when I told them what it was.

Thank you, LUSH

The scent of Cynthia Sylvia Stout shampoo is fabulous, sticks with you, and the shampoo also is great.  The price is steep, yes, but worth it.  Don't bother with the 3.3 oz "trial size" because you'll most likely only waste shipping charges and go on to order the bigger bottles next time

...but I didn't care for the smell.  It does smell like beer and I could smell it throughout the day after I used it (smell fades throughout the day), but I guess if you like the smell of this shampoo, then it won't be a problem at all.  Did notice my hair was shinier and softer(which is hard to say for my hair), but had to knock off a star for the scent.  

Cynthia Sylvia Stout Shampoo was just `okay' and I will be sticking with Rehab, Big, and I Love Juicy (see my reviews).  Try a smaller size bottle first, and remember that some of the products IN the LUSH store smells different when you get them home

As I stated in my other reviews, I have color-treated otherwise normal hair which is wavy and prone to frizz.  I like this shampoo for it's calming effect, best experienced after a couple of uses.  If you straighten your hair, this will work great because the shine and smoothness will be most noticable.

To those of you worried that your boss may think you spent your lunch break in a pub - the stout scent fades quick and is only really identifyable while washing.  

A word to the wise, this shampoo is a bit drying.  I make sure to deep condition at least once a week to avoid crispy hair.

I purchased this cleanser about 3 weeks ago. I saw a dramatic difference in my oily, acne-prone skin after a day or 2. It works well if you remove your makeup first with a cleanser and then use it. It has really refined my skin and made it more smooth and I've had much less breakouts. I am very happy with this product and plan to repurchase again. It works well with the oily skin solution too! A great product

This is a great product to enhanse and define curls. It's work perfectly with very curly hair without any stifness. The only reason i don't give it five stars is because if you have long hair and want to define your curls but hav some volume as well, this mousse as a tendancy to reduce the volume of very long hair. So great for curls, but without volumizing effect. The price too is kind of expensive. This product is cheaper in france: around 18-24 Euros. It is worth the price though and Kerastase products are seen as the best in Europe

       There's something about Armani!  His fragrances are as stylish and classic as his designs.  Acqua Di Gio is a case in point with its virile, mysterious, intriguing scent.  It's fresh and at the same time sensual.

	Notes include Calabrian bergamot, neroli, and the zest of green tangerine, each warming and giving vitality to the fragrance.

	Mr. Armani has said that the inspiration for this scent came from the shoreline of Pantelleria island, a body of land which lies in the Mediterranean Sea between Sicily and Tunisia.   Pantelleria is one of a kind, a rarity as is Acqua Di Gio.

I bought this and several other Philosphy 3-in-1 products totally based on their yummy smell, and this is probably my favorite!  It truly smells like a melting strawberry milkshake made with fresh strawberries and whole milk ice cream.  I never get tired of the smell!  

I will admit I have only used this as body wash, not as shampoo or conditioner.  I have found that combination products do not work well on my dry curly hair, so I cannot attest to the hair cleaning properties of this product.  I can say that I've been using Philosphy products on my skin for about a year, and I love them.  I have found that my skin has been slightly less dry since I switched from my old product.

I (and I've heard many others say this same thing) have found that the fragrance does not linger strongly on your skin after your shower.  My husband never smells my flavor du jour on my skin after my shower, and I am glad, because I don't think strawberries and Clinique Happy go well together.  So if you are concerned about smelling like you stepped out of Dairy Queen, don't

Try this cream on your neck and chest (the areas that often get neglected-- once you get wrinkle or sagging on your neck, you can't do anything to hide your age!!!).   I was surprised to see an immediate difference in appearance of neck and chest, giving it a smooth glow.  My mom tried it on her neck and before she even told me I thought her neck looked smoother.  This cream is too creamy for my combo face which tends to get oily throughout the day.

I am by no means any kind of expert on the in's and out's of quality cologne.  I do however know what works for my chemistry and what works for the ladies.  When I first smelled Touch, I thought, "Not bad, and an attractive bottle."  The initial spray did not grab me, however with the dry down....it was wonderful.  I actually had a young lady at my job physically stop me in the hall, sniff my neck, and look at me with longing eyes and ask what I was wearing!  At that point, I knew that Touch was going to be part of my "smell good" arsenal

Let me first start of by saying I love 'Touch' by Burberry, I wear it more than I wear any other cologne I own. It is very versatile and  not too strong in its fragrance. However, the scent doesn't last very long and you may have to spray a few more times than usual to achieve results that will last to your hoping.

'Touch' is the first cologne Burberry has designed that leans towards a "sour" smell but in this case, it works. 'Touch' is very romantic, elegant, provocative, and sensational all at once...but its effects are only minimal. Maybe if it were redesigned to produce long-lasting results then I would probably add the 5th star to this rating but unfortunately, the scene span of 'Touch' can only leave me wishing.

"Touch" is one of 10 kinds of colognes in my collection and it's the best, hands down.  It's that kind of scent that you can wear to any occasion (formal, night out on the town) with any kind of clothing (suit, casual).  I get a lot of comments from the ladies, too

So glad I was able to find the Estee Lauder Equalizer Smart Loose Powder on this website... Thank You, Thank You, Thank You!
All the stores I've been to have discontinued it and it's the best stuff around for me. All I have to do after applying my moisturizer is use a little concealer where necessary, use this powder &amp; I'm Done!  No more foundations, nothing!  The color 03
Medium gives me a little color, smooths my pores making my face look soft and radiant. I ordered three just in case Estee Lauder's really going to do away with this powder (their so-called "replacement" in the stores "Lucidity Loose Powder" in the supposed same color 03 Medium is nasty stuff!  It smells yucky, it's cakey, and the color is not even close!!!)  I'm going to order at least 3 more (even at $25 a piece it's well worth it.

The powdery scent of fresh flowers and musk; Chanel # 19 is sex personified. I could spend an entire evening in a pair of Italian heels and this fragrance alone. A matter of fact I did. 

When I smell Chanel # 19 I think of cold winter nights wrapped up in cashmere laying on a leather chaise with the heat of a warm fire bath me. Chanel #19 evokes the glorious feel of crisp winters and elegant evenings. A subtle fragrance that becomes more powerful with the heat of your body so it's best in the winter or very special occasions.

I highly recommend Chanel # 19 if you need a lift in mood this winter. One whiff and your mood will be elevated, I promise. Even the sight of the perfume is wonderful. A beautiful classic glass Chanel bottle' the delicate liquid beckons you to put it on and enjoy. Just the feel of the bottle in your hand is glorious.

Evoke your sense of smell, sight, and touch with Chanel # 19.

girldiver:)
Thank You Jim Pfrommer for the gift.

This is the best foundation for my skin. I have rather fair, sensitive skin, and have been searching for the "perfect" foundation for years. I have found it in this product which is lightweight and silky. My skin feels so soft and delicate and looks great with this product on. It provides excellent coverage and stays on for hours; it goes on remarkably well and blends just as easily.

I really like this cleanser. I have tried many different brands; both high-end and over the counter, and this one really does exactly what it should. It cleanses my skin without drying and actually makes it feel moisturized without feeling weighed down. I tend toward dry, flaky, sensitive skin on my face and this is just a great cleanser for my problem skin. You just need to make sure that this product is fresh and doesn't sit past it's shelf life because it does contain shea butter and will go bad after it's expiration or if exposed to sunlight/heat.

For a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is MAC. Lipglass feels good on your lips, as if it contained some emollients. And (this is a big AND) it's not tacky or sticky. 

The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. 

Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. 

Enjoy!

MAC LipGlass is the absolute best. There are plenty of colors to choose from, SUPER-Shiny, and the gloss is thick, stays on and doesn't run. 
The best colors are....
NICO for a cute lavender pink color with a glittery shine. 
OYSTERGIRL is a shimmery baby pink.
OH BABY is the perfect gloss for any earth toned lipstick.
CHAI looks amazing with black smokey eyes. It's the perfect neutral earthy gloss and has no glitter or shimmer - just pure shine

I'm REALLY anal about scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored with vanilla, but MAC LipGlass isn't that vanilla-ish at all!  It's got very pigmented color, it stays on a LONG time for a gloss, and each tube lasts a long time...  Don't let what the other reviewer said about the vanilla scent throw you off

Finally, women everywhere can have the same effects of a facelift without the expense or the pain! This sumptuous cream from Clarins will help avoid that "rugged" look on the neck as soon as it starts to become evident; thus making you look younger because, once the signs of aging start to appear on the neck, they reflect on a woman's appearance as a whole.  You will notice a difference in the tightness of the skin of your neck right after the first application.  Subsequent ones will just make a good thing even better.

Clarins has been a leader in beauty products for years now and they have been my favorite brand since I discovered them in my early twenties. Their line is extensive in very specific treatments (such as body and bust oils, etc.); so much much so, that I've never seen a neck cream from any of the other prestigious skin care brands - such as Shiseido and Guerlain for instance. I use most of their products but this one, I truly love. Highly reccommended

I have recently became a Clinique lover. I was a little worried about buying at the full price before either testing it in stores or getting it somewhere cheaper in case the color was wretched. I got my tube from Ebay for a little less than retail. When it came in the mail the color was just gorgeous. Surprise is actually a bronze shimmer color, almost a sparkle metallic. The color is so rich on my lips but doesn't look overdone. It feels light and stays with me which is a plus. Before wasting your money on colors that you will use once or twice, why not splurge a little for something you're sure to love a lot? In the end it's not a splurge really because you're sure to use use use and come back for more!

My wife casually mentioned that she really liked this new Hypnose perfume she smelled in a magazine advertisement.  Hint! Hint! Hint!  So, I bought it for her, of course.  I like the smell - to me it has a hint of citrusy, flowery, vanilla aroma.  And it's a lighter, not cloying perfume, which I prefer.  I would definitely give this perfume a thumbs up

In the search for a signature scent- I've found my bliss. I first smelled this perfume in my Lucky magazine. Just rubbing the paper on my wrist, I was transported. Of course you can't tell how a perfume will work with your chemistry until you've tried it for at least a week. I picked up a sample in a department store and each time I wore Hypnose I was hypnotized again. The name is very appropriate. 

It's a feminine scent that is fresh, and actually induces a soothing and happy mood. The notes are vanilla absolut, passionflower, and vetiver. It's joyfully calming. 

Also, it's not overwhelming. Others will have to stand very close to you in order to smell it.

While it seems these days that most shampoos have a specific purpose (ie- volumizing, de-frizzing, curl-enhancing, color-protecting, etc.) this one is an amazing all-around shampoo, wonderful for daily use for all types, colors and styles of hair. The smell is incredible - truly invigorating to wake up to in the morning shower. It doesn't leave any buildup or residue as many shampoos often do, so you don't have to worry about switching your shampoo every few weeks. Its a great classic which I hope stays around forever- I'll remain a loyal fan!

Good stuff!  A little pricey, though.  Great for summer - makes you feel cool and tingly all over - even makes me get goosebumps sometimes!  The cooling effects even last for a little while after you get out of the shower!  Very concentrated so you don't need a lot of it, and it doesn't run all over the place like some other body washes do.  Even my husband likes it!  Would be nice if it were a little more moisturizing, though.  If not for that and the price, I would have given this a 5 star review.

During a recent stay at the W Hotel in New York City, I thoughtlessly used the complimentary toiletries, which happened to be Blisslabs products.  I was so impressed that the same day I went on a major shopping spree to Bliss's in-hotel boutique and I haven't used anything else since. I love their products and cannot recommend them highly enough. Their Shock Therapy is my favorite product. If you don't like the smell of peppermint, this is not the body wash for you, but if you do, this will become your new morning ritual. The smell of mint is very, very strong, and refreshing, truly helping to clear out the early-morning cobwebs. The shower gel is clear and smooth, not grainy. It washes off cleanly and is SO refreshing. It's a great change from the ultrafeminine floral/fruity scents out there. There's a 16-ounce size out there for $32.00--almost twice the size for an extra $9. You can't go wrong. You'll love this stuff.

One pump is enough for problem areas -around my mouth, between brows, forehead.

This stuff goes on easy, stays well (but WILL rub off with water, won't withstand a good cry).  Nice.  Not quite as nice as the Victoria's Secret liner (I swear by that stuff, discontinued 3-4 years ago), but WAY better than anything cheaper.  I have TRIED other things.  Plus, won't irritate my very sensitive eyes

This is a great little lip gloss collection - all of the LOLA lip gloss colors in mini bottles. While kind of pricey, I love it since I can never make up my mind and would have a hard time shelling out $16 for something I might not wear. I love these glosses, they're light, tasteless-to-slightly-minty, long-lasting and relatively non-sticky (as far as glosses go - I'm a very low-makeup girl, so the fact that I can wear these without getting my hair glued to my lips is a big plus!) One caveat: this is a sampler - these are TINY bottles (each roughly the size of my pinkie), but that can be a bonus if you want something to slip in the smallest pocket or purse. I've now bought two of my favorites (celestial and rush) in the full-size version for daily wear, which lets me save the mini versions for days I need something tiny, and the rest aren't colors I'll wear every day, but I love the option when I want something different.

The Lola Gloss Menagerie is all a girl could ask for in a small, cute gloss. The colors are perfect for layering, and each cute tube lasts quite a while longer than I would have expected. The refreshingly light peppermint taste is very pleasant, and is not overpowering at all. Although it has a hefty price tag, the Menagerie is very much worth it. These make cute gifts as well, and almost every girl will love the convinient sizing, as well as the super shine it emits. It's not sticky at all. I love it

I usually wear the socks with the cream for 2 to 3 hours. I've had them since Christmas and have used them twice a week and after only 4 treatments (using the softening sock salve), my heels are SO much smoother and softer! I had really deep cracks in my heels with sharp chunks poking out - even using a heel file didn't help! But these things are already showing drastic improvement!  The only part that's hard for me is soaking my feet first, so I usually do it in the morning after my shower.  {Another nice benefit of being a stay at home mom ;-)}

My box lists step by step instructions including how to hand wash them. After 4 uses (2-3 hours as stated previously) I feel no need to wash these - my feet do NOT sweat in them.  I've even worn a pair of slipper socks over them to help keep them clean when I walked around the house (careful with that one - they're pretty slick when you first put them on with the softening sock salve!) and my feet still didn't sweat.

I DO recommend using the softening sock salve with them for faster results. 

I hope everyone is as happy with these as I am

I first tried Tend Skin from an article in a beauty magazine. I first bought it from Sephora, and the worker there told me it does hurt when you put it on..but it's worth it. I do agree that it does sting when you put it on after shaving, but it's the only thing that has stopped my sensitive skin from breaking out in rashes or bumps.  As far as preventing in-grown hairs, it does help. It doesn't prevent them totally, but with a combination of exfoliating and using Tend Skin, I've found that it works pretty well

I received a smaple size of this face creme with my recent order of my hunny's anniversary present from Estee Lauder. It came with a bunch of other stuff that I either swapped or gave away, but this was a real winner for me. It came as a 5-day supply, and I just wish I had more. 

I used this creme as a supplement to other lotions I wasn't thrilled with, namely, Neutrogena Whip Moisturizer with SPF 15 or 30, and Clinique Super City Block SPF 40(but I'm still undecided about this one). Both of these weren't smooth enough. they didn't have that nice slip to spread easily across the skin. The former I had to use a lot of on its owen to really moisturize the lower half of my face, and the latter I had to rub very hard in order to get it to spread without this creme. 

I love that this creme gets the job done. Out of all the moisturizers I have used for my face, I have had to use this one the most sparingly in order to moisturize, and I like that. I can imagine it coests more than the other two moisturizers, but it also does a better job. 

I don't like that when I first put it on, it seems to warm up my face a bit around the nose and mouth. Ordinarily this wouldn't bother me, but seeing as to how almost every other thing has been breaking me out recently, it makes me a teensy bit paranoid. Howver, this sensation does not persist, so I don't worry too much about it. The other thing is that it takes alittle longer to sink into the skin, and until it does, it gives my skin the look as if I have been sweating, but then it's in and my skin just feels good. 

Isn't that what moisture is all about?

I'm usually a drugstore mascara girl--my current fave is Maybelline's Full and Soft--but I had the opportunity to pick this up cheap, so I decided to try it. Immediately, I liked the thinner-sized tube (can't stand those overly fat mascaras!) and the stiff-bristled brush. The product is a bit on the dry side, but I much prefer that to wet and gloppy. There wasn't too much product on the brush, and it was easy to apply. I definitely noticed a lengthening effect beyond what I've seen with any other mascara, which was great because it made my small eyes look much more open. Also, the product stayed put all day long, absolutely no smudging or flaking. My only slight disappointment was that it left my lashes looking a bit thin, as the effect is long and spidery; I guess I'm used to the fullness I get from my everyday mascara, Full and Soft.  I will continue to use Definicils for times when I particularly want more length, and I've found that I can layer it with my Full and Soft to get both the length and fullness I want.  I would repurchase this if I could get it for a discount again, but I would not pay full price

OK, this is a true story. I was in the gym last week, and I went into the locker room to wash my hands after my workout. I opened the door and was immediately startled by an amazing scent -- unlike anything I had encountered before. Someone's perfume? I wondered. But it was so different! I wondered whether the person was still in the locker room. I was at the sink when I saw someone walking around by the back wall. I couldn't help myself from what happened next, even though I knew I would sound like a freak: "Is that your perfume I smell?" I asked her. "Yes," she replied pensively, probably thinking I was going to complain about someone using perfume in the locker room. "WHAT IS IT?? It's the most wonderful thing I have ever smelled," I said. "Burberry Weekend," she replied, as her face melted into the the confident, self-satisfactory smile of a woman who knows she has something another woman wants. 

I excitedly told my husband what happened that day, and I am hoping he will buy me some of this incredible fragrance for Christmas.

Deep Clover by Votiva is the nicest aroma in any candle that I have sampled.  It is not over-powering and yet it does the job.  It is a warm, sensual fragrance

These are great candles and make great gifts because they are packed so nice.

The candles burn evenly and nice and slowly.  The scents are great!  Natural smelling and strong enough but not overwhelming in any way.  I can burn one of these on my first level and scent the whole floor unlike most other candles where I need to burn multiple candles to get the same level of scent...

So yes, they are more expensive than candles you can get but when I burn this one, its the only one I need to burn at a time...  with cheaper candles I dont really end up savings because I am burning several at once.

Ordered two of these candles as gifts (Red Current &amp; Moroccan Fig).  They come carefully packaged in a nice box, and the candle is in a clear glass voltive.  Red Current is a more perfumey scent with an undertone of fruit, while the Fig is sort of sweet-earthy.  A good housewarming/hostess gift

This summer I have been using Neutrogena's tanning mousse in medium.  Allure gave the Neutrogena product a great review.  I like it because like this product, it gives an instant color while also including the chemical that develops a tan over the hours.  However, I have been having to bleach my bath towels to get out the leftover mousse on my legs after I get out of the shower at night (If I don't it gets on my sheets.)  Also, you have to work quickly with your hands to spread the mousse before it streaks. Then you have to clean it from your fingernails.

I tried this Modelco spray at Sephora today.  It goes on very evenly, no hand blending needed.  It is lighter than the medium Neutrogena, which is great bec I am very fair skinned.  Much easier to apply, but costs a lot more.  I'll prob use it on weekends because you can spray all those hard to reach areas.  During the week when I'm just doing my legs I'll  stick to the cheaper Neutrogena product.

I don't know what I would do without this mascara!!  This mascara is to me beyond the best that I have ever used, (and I have had my share of investments in other brands of mascara only to be sadly disappointed).  I would give this product 10 stars if Amazon would let me.  I have to confess that I carry this mascara with me everywhere (not that you have to re-touch up during the day -- because you dont, but just so that I won't ever lose it). Truly a product worth trying.

This is the very BEST hairstyler and hair dryer in one! I have very fine, thick, shoulder lenght hair and was a little skeptical that this product would be usefull for me. It is! Actually it is the best hair styling product I have ever purchased. It dries and sets my hair very quickly, usually in five minutes or less. What a timesaver. I am so delighted with this product that I purchased eight (8) to keep in my closet so I don't have to hunt for the best product EVER!!!

I love the fragrance of Happy, I have the perfume and body lotion as well as this body wash.  Even if you use a different brand of perfume, you should get this body wash.  It's light and pretty--citrus with soft floral.  Showering with it is a refreshing, energizing experience, and it leaves my skin soft and silky.  The scent is light enough that it won't clash if you use other fragrances. It's really comforting in the mornings--highly recommended!

Not sure how someone in their early 20's can be worried about wrinkles!  One has to have wrinkles in order to apprecialte the results of this product.  I am in my early 60's and have very wrinkly upper eye lids.  All I have to do is use one drop of this product on my eyelids to see instant results.  It doesn't seem to matter if you use it over or under moisturizer.  I use it before I put on my makeup and it has saved me from going for eyelift surgery!  I think that says allot

If your into light smells, this one is for you.  After becoming pregnant I realized I could not wear most of my perfumes, but I still wanted to wear some sort of fragrance.  This one is perfect because it is very light, and smells just like a lemon with a bit of sweetness!

My boyfriend hates what he calls "food" scents.  He makes an exception for this - he can scent it from across the room even though it is very light.  The only other fragrance that gets a positive reaction from him is Chanel's Madamoiselle, which is heavier and more wintry

I was having a very bad week and the other day I fell down and today I was aching so much I didn't want to get out of bed. But, I had to and I figured today was a good day to try Wiccy Massage bar. It feels cool on the skin and you can smell the peppermint and cinnamon it smells really good. This product works because almost all my aches are gone. Highly Recommended

I got this for my boyfriend, who works all day lifting heavy plants in a nursery. He loved it from the minute I applied it to his sore back. The smell is calming, and the spices warm up the sore muscles like an icy-hot patch, but much better. It melts easily into the skin, but lasts a long time. It feels so creamy and warm. Now he always begs me to give him a massage

Woooo! This one lets it presence be known! It is a great thing, but it definitely kicks up some smell- not necessarily a bad smell, just a Strong one!! It has a cinnamony/rosemary smell that will kick your sinuses into high gear. The beans and the melty oils are great and they certainly do their job, just don't expect to rub yourself down at the gym and head back to work! Be prepared to bathe before sleeping with a body covered in this. Rosemary and whatever else is in it will keep you awake.

If you haven't used a massage bar before, this takes a little getting used to. It's solid at room temperature, but melts right away in contact with skin. This bar has cinnamon and other lovely things to really 'sink in' and warm up muscles. Not as much as medicated creams like Ben Gey and such, but enough to add to a good massage. And it smells so much better. The aduki beans are a nice addition, as they definately help with the massage around the neck and upper shoulder areas, as well as the bottom of your feet. A little goes a very, very long way. I give my husband weekly back and foot rubs with this and we've had the same bar for about three-four months and its still going strong

Tough to understand unless you are near one of their outlets.  I found this soap in the Macy's on Michigan in Chicago.  It is highly addictive.  They send samples of other soaps and things with each order, and we like almost all of them.  Good stuff

Normally at our house, we threaten to wash the cats (they don't like water too much and will normally only peer curiously into the bathroom when I'm in the tub. Now and then they have played with bubbles), but this does have an amusing name. 

I did think it was more like "Honey, I lost the soap in the tub again." This is one melting dream soap that can easily slip away into the depths of a luxurious lush bath. This soap is good with the Think Pink bath bomb and some of the Creamy Candy Bath bubble bar. 

If you love this, you may simply faint when you order a Sultana of Soap (oh my!). Avowash (avocado and olive oil), Ooh La La (lavender) and Bohemian (lemon) are also fun.

Loved the scent and feel of this soap! I'm a bath product junkie and my latest cravings have been for anything honey scented and this soap is wonderful.  My only complaint is that it did use up pretty quickly and left a mess in the dish.  I'd not leave it in the shower next time.

This product leaves your skin slightly sticky feeling (not in a bad way, it disapears in a few minutes). The scent is light enough to not be overbearing (though it smells stronger in the shower). It does help if you have slightly dry skin. Overall, I really liked this product and plan to savor it till the end

If you have tried such products as ProActiv to help clear up your breakouts and haven't been that impressed, try this line of Murad products.  (Clarifying)  Used after the Clarifying Cleanser, this toner leaves your face feeling fresh.  It removes all the residual oil from your skin, but doesn't leave your face feeling dry.  Just the opposite, it hydrates your skin while helping to control breakouts and oil.  I have nice clear skin for the first time in years - all due to this line of Murad products.  I couldn't be happier

Murad Clarifying Toner has helped in controlling my facial breakouts. I have been using this product for six weeks and noticed how great my skin looks. This toner is so cooling when applied. Murad Clarifying Toner features algae extract to help in diminishing the excess oil in the skin. The toner gets deep down to my pores and effectively hydrates my skin without any irritation.

The Essie Protein Base Coat is two steps in one and while you are giving yourself a manicure or pedicure (or taking these along to the salon - a good idea because they are better than the other polishes and dry faster!), you will notice how this smoothes out your nails and prepares them for a perfect nail polish finish. This formula contains camphor, silica and collagen for healthy, strong and flexible nails. The nail polishes also go on perfectly and there are so many colors to choose from!

Safari has been discontinued and is no longer sold in department stores. I think it was one of Ralph Laurens better perfumes. I wore it from the year it came out until it was discontinued. I was complimented on it constantly. I even had a guys angling to sit by me just to breathe in the scent. The reason I think it was dicontinued - it changed into a totally different scent after only a few months of the opening spray. The real fragrance didn't last long enough. My sister had a bottle that she kept for three years - it reeked! I know, I know, all perfume ages, but not like Safari did. It happened to fast, within three months or less. So I loved it, and wore it for years, but I can understand why some people complained about it. I was thinking about making a purchase here at Amazon, but I don't want to get the old smelly stuff.

The new Estee Lauder lipsticks seems to be very moisturizing and smooth and this lip liner helps to keep your pouty look all in place. The lipstick alone does not give you well defined lips and this liner really takes the look from a 5 to a 10. You can apply it before or after you apply lipstick and it works equally well. If you can find the cognac shade, it goes very well with the sumptuous lipstick.

Burberry Brit is one of my staple fragrances ... I'm on my third bottle which my mother thankfully supplied me at Christmas this year. Brit has a deep, warm vanilla amber scent, but it is not sweet. It is rich and oh-so-slightly woody, with a creamy undertone. It's fairly long-lasting too. If, like me, you're not big on florals, you'll appreciate Brit's spicy amber glow. I don't find it particularly strong, but then my tastes in fragrance run on the strong side (as long as it's not overpowering). I know I'll love this one for years to come.

My mother bought this perfume for me two Christmases ago. At first I thought it was too heavy. However, once I started wearing it I fell in love with it. I've never received so many compliments on a perfume in my life. Men and women randomly stop me in hallways, in restaurants, and the street ti ask me what I am wearing. "You smell so good..." I wear it everyday now and am on my third bottle.

I absolutely adore the Burberry Brit fragrance! As someone who dislikes floral scents, this scent is for me. I absolutely adore the deep vanilla and spice accents. While it may be a bit intense for summer, it is perfect for fall and winter. The scent also wears well throughout the day. Unlike many other, perhaps less expensive perfumes, this scent will stay with you throughout the day. I love catching just a hint of the fragrance as I take off my coat or untie my scarf on chilly days. Buy it for yourself or as a gift, you will not be disappointed

I have searched for a great perfume for many years, and have finally found it! Burberry Brit is sexy, yet not overpowering. Both men and women are attracted to the smell, and I suggest smelling it in Vogue and then ordering several bottles before it is out of stock

       What is it they say about love?  A better question might be what don't they say about love?  It makes the world go round.  What the world needs now is more of it.  It's a many splendored thing.  A moments madness.  The list goes on and on. .Little wonder it's also the inspiration for a bold, seductive new fragrance from Cacharel.	
	
	It arrives in a brilliant red bottle, the color of a heart, the shade of passion.  Amor Amor is both romantic and vivacious with top notes of pink grapefruit, blood orange, sweet mandarin and black currant.  Heart notes are found in apricot, red rose, jasmine melati flower and lily of the valley.  

	Available in 1 oz, 1.7 oz. and 3.4 oz. sprays, it promises to be a highly coveted fragrance at an affordable price.

We lose so much time over it - and you know what I'm talking about, you debaters of scissors v. tweezers - but God has told me to tell y'all to rest your souls. Thusly: Proper nasal care can only be accomplished with tweezers.

Yes, there's pain. But pain is the holy child of vanity, to whom we must bow down

Is so true of this product.  I have to admit when I first saw the price tag of this product, it was half out of curiousity that I purchased.  I mean could a pair of $20 tweezers be THAT much better than the ole $1.75 or $3 pairs at home?  

Well if your asking yourself that question, YES!  These things have amazing grip and can pull the tinyiest of hairs.  Things that you would have to dig with normal tweezers until you finally rub your skin raw.

Without a doubt, you will get your moneys worth from this product as well as be amazed at their performance.  It's the type of "WOW" that makes you feel like, "How did I ever get along without these before".

Worth every penny and I'll never buy another cheap tweezer again.  These have lasted for years and still retain their fine point.

These tweezers rock! This gets all the hairs you want gone fast and effectively. This is also easy to manuever around the eyebrow area.  I can get into spots and get the hairs I could not get with any of my other tweezers which I have since gotten rid of.  This is worth the money.  These tweezers will last and last and you will not be disappointed. You can also choose from a variety of cool colors too. I highly recommend these tweezers.

I had an Amazon reward certificate and was looking for something practical to use it on.  It so happened that I needed new tweezers.  I read the reviews and thought I'd give these a try.  Wow, I can't believe the difference in quality from any other tweezers I have ever owned.  They almost seem to adhere to whatever your are trying to grasp.  It is so easy to precisely and almost painlessly remove even the finest eyebrow hair.  Tweezerman Tweezers ROCK!

Tweezerman really are the BEST tweezers on the market and to say, the cutest. With different colors to choose from, the fact that they're reliable and strong only adds to them.

Tweezers gone dull and you need them sharpened? You don't need to go to the store anymore and buy new ones. Tweezerman sharpens them free of charge with S&amp;H so long as you send in an envelope.

My final point: I don't see a point in buying any other tweezer since you buy one pair and it lasts you the rest of your life

I picked this up at my local Body Shop store because truthfully I couldn't decide between all the flavors in large sizes, and I got to try all these beautiful scents in one easy purchase. Great for traveling or simply displaying in the bathroom, these little gems make me happy in the morning when an extra ompf is needed to get me out of my warm bed and under cold water!

My favorite so far is the Mango, and in all honesty I don't like to eat the fruit raw, but I love it in mixed recipes and in bath and body products.

Each wash is 2 oz. and enough for a few uses, making it fun to do a switcheroo every time I hop in the shower. The scents are Tropical Mango, Coconut, Passionfruit, Strawberry, and Satsuma.

Mango is lovely, slightly tangy and bitter , like a grapefruit but with a velvety sweet scent that is a pleasure to use. This is a gel.

Coconut is another favorite, creamy and juicy, like real coconut milk, not overly sweet but pure and authentic smelling. This is a creamy wash, not a gel.

Passionfruit is refreshing, green and purple at the same time, smells like a mixture of kiwis, lemons and melon,  a contrast of tart and sweet succulence.

Strawberry is not bad but has a hint of plastic in it, it's not the truest flavor I came across, but it seems pretty hard to fabricate, since the fruit itself is slightly sour and delicate. For a shower gel its fine, but if this was a flavored food product I'd probably skip it. This comes in the gel form.

Satsuma is crazy, a sugary tropical warm orange like hot flavor that turns my bathroom into a wicked retreat from reality. Very strong and pungent but fun when I'm in the mood for intense tropical experience. This comes in the gel form.

Overall I have nothing but praise, although the price is a bit high, but the whole set is a fun way to try out all the flavors and makes a great gift, it also lookS beautiful in the see through container, like a carousel of colors waiting to be enjoyed.

Okay, it's silly but I originally tried this cologne because Liv Tyler was the model for its launch. Well, I was hooked.  Although its base is rose peony, it's not strongly floral.  When it dries down, the scent that captivates you is the star anise - spicy and a little addicting.  And it lasts so long!  One little spritz and I'm good for the whole day

I am definitely a Beauty Junkie. I have tried probably every Volumizing product on the market (including the much lauded Phyto Volumizer) but I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this Kerastase product so much! It is by far the best! It leaves your hair silky smooth and with TONS of volume (even after blowdrying it for 15 minutes). It doesn't leave behind a gummy or sticky residue. It is a little expensive but it has a lot of bang for its buck and I would even pay more for it if I had to. I will never use anything else again!

I've enjoyed using the Loc Butter on my natural hair as well as my two pre-teen daughters' natural hair.  It is a tad heavy and sticky - just right for keeping plaits, braids, and twists, frizz free.  I also found that it works well for hot combing and flat ironing.  The scent is kind of musky/spicy, and we like it.   It doesn't overwhelm, but is quite pleasant. (the scent is not as pleasant with heating implements) I don't think it would be good for daily use because it would probably get very heavy and greasy (it has beeswax, and multiple oils).  I don't have locs but it works beautifully for my daughter's two strand twists.  The twists hold together well with minimal frizzing.

I purchased 07 sheer caramel, which is a pretty accurate description of that color (warm medium brown).  It's a very natural and beautiful shade.  It is sheer as the name implies, but there is still a good amount of color.  The smell is pleasant and sweet, with a smooth and light texture.  It has the coverage of a lipstick and the moisture of a gloss, without being sticky. It's kind of like a tinted lip balm, but the color is more substantial.  It actually feels better on my lips than a balm.  The appearance is semi-glossy, but not goopy looking like a traditional gloss. There is a little bit of sparkle, but it's not chunky like glitter.  I would prefer it not to have any sparkle at all, which is my only complaint (and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5).  I think the formula is shiny enough that it doesn't need any added glimmer effect.  Honestly, I think cosmetics manufacturers have gone overboard with putting glitter in virtually everything.  Enough already!  Anyway, I still like this lipstick despite my sparkle hang-up.  It is packaged in a slim silver tube that is very chic, simple, and easy to apply.

I have really long hair and I use a lot of conditioner. This is a good treatment for the winter when my naturally blonde hair starts to grow out a bit darker than my summer haircolor. It doesn't lighten hair very dramatically at all on its own, but it conditions very well and smells really nice, like a lemony custard.

I use this by warming it slightly in the microwave so it sinks in better, then applying it to dry hair. I tie my hair into a bun and wait twenty minutes or so, then rinse it gently, wash my hair using The Blonde shampoo, and condition with a light conditioner.

If you don't really want your hair lightened much and just want a bit of extra shine and highlight to your blonde hair, this is great on its own. If you want a more dramatic effect, The Blonde solid conditioner works for a stronger effect. The Blonde can be drying though so I do like to use them together

I have been using Carol's Daughter for about 8 months now and I swear by this line! I really like the Kizzi because it slicks down edges, baby hairs and tames frizz. IT ALSO WORKS WONDERS ON BRAIDS! I have been able to keep my cornrows an extra two weeks because I tie my hair with Kizzi every night. Here is the secret: Spary hair with CD Black Vanilla Leave in Conditioner and then use about a quarter size of Kizzi on the edges of the braids all the way down to wear your real hair ends. In the morning your hair will look smooth, polished and shiney!

Happy Heart - even better than the original Happy which is a bit more Citrusy. I use it day or night.    

The roll-on applicator is a great idea as it's small enough for a purse yet lasts and lasts. It doesn't leak and the cap doesn't fall off either.

Even better, it doesn't seem to trigger attacks with my allergic friends. (You're wearing perfume but I'm not sneezing! OMG! What kind that?)

I cannot say enough about this fantastic product.  Clinique has (probably) the best skincare system out there.  My face was a mess and other moisturizers had clogged my pores and caused terrible breakouts.  The moisturizing gel is the third step in their skincare regime.  First, you wash your face with the Clinique soap best-suited for your skin type (normal, dry or combination/greasy), then you follow it with their clearing lotion (ie exfoliant/astringent) and you (finally) apply this gel to your face and neck.  Their moisturizer is also available as a lotion for for drier complexions.  The gel is oil free and gets the job done, without clogging your pores, while working with its PH balance.  Highly reccomended!!

   I originally received a sample of this in the mail.  I was so surprised by the scent of pumpkin and spice when I used it that I immediatley went online searching for it to purchase.  Not only that, but the scent stays with you all day.   There will be moments when I have to smile because I catch it in the air.  Smells so good you want to eat it.  It also made my hair feel so healthy and soft.  Definitely worth the price.

My skin is very sensitive and my face breaks out in little bumps if I use anything that leaves a residue.  I've used Cetaphil soap for years but it doesn't get all of my eye makeup off.  I bought this on impulse and it's the best face cleanser I've ever found.  It doesn't dry my skin at all, and removes every speck of makeup.  I think the soy also evens out my skin tone

Fresh is a company I have been interested in for awhile. I first fell in love with their product line when I used the Brown Sugar Body Polish. I knew this was a product that would become a beauty staple around my house. I have since purchased several other items from Fresh, especially from their skincare, bodycare and fragrance lines. I find that Fresh Soy Formula f21c Face Cleanser is one of their best products. And the price is right, especially given the cost of some of the high quality face cleansers on the market.

This unique face cleansing gel is fabulous. The texture is somewhat unusual. It is a clear gel and feels very slippery when applied. The gel foams, ever-so-slightly, almost like a lotion,  and feels great on dry skin. The face cleanser does an excellent job of removing makeup and leaving the skin soft, comfortably clean and glowing. It also tones the skin, revives the eyelid area and conditions the eyelashes in the process. What could be better? And all in one single product! 

For the winter months, this is a perfect compromise between the fresh, clean feeling of a gel and the comfortable, soothing feeling of a lotion. It is my normal-to-dry skin's new favorite cleanser. Soy Face Cleanser contains rose extract, cornflower extract, glycerin, mallow extract, chamomile extract, ginseng, aloe, soybean powder, soybean protein, borage seed oil, cucumber extract, vitamin A, vitamin E and gentle cleansing agents.

I cannot recommend Fresh skin and body products enough - and the Fresh Soy Formula Face Cleanser is a winner!

Clinique makes the best eyeshadows, they're so light and creamy! They don't crease and don't fade. I love Beach Plum (a rich, shimmery plum and shimmery-gold duo), it perfectly accents my brown eyes. They're a bit pricey, but they're worth every penny

I bought this product at Sephora with some friends. I'd give it a 4 out of 5.

POSITIVES:
absolutely beautiful colors
they can be layered and mixed to create new shades of gloss
small enough to fit in the tiniest pocket or purse
the case is worth keeping after you use up the glosses, I still have mine :)
the flavor is delisious, so realistically the taste of sugary sweetness

NEGATIVES:
they are a little on the sticky side
all the shades cannot possibly look good on one person. I recommend spliting them with a friend
they are not long lasting, the flavor lasts longer then the color
the tubes are incredibly tiny

I have been a rabid fan of Lush products for years, often having them shipped to me form Canada before they were so easy to buy in the states. Each product has a certain Earthy quality it and its nice knowing that people who make each an every single on of these luscious concoctions love them as much as the customers do and it shows!

The Karma soap looks like a slab of gold in shape but is really reminiscent of candied carrots I would find in fruit cakes I used to eat as a kid growing up in Poland. The clarity of the fiery jewel like color is quite attractive as it makes for a nice soap to put in the guest bathroom or for self spoiling with hand made soaps that beat the other cookie cutter types by a mile. The scent itself is a breezy breath of citrus with mother earth embedded deep in the core. The lavender and patchouli are a whisper, a shadowy backbone to the zest and freshness. The multidimensionality of layering scents makes fore a very uplifting experience and I can smell the heady aromas every time I was my hands with it. I also love the Karma perfume, which smells almost exactly as the soap.

I find that my hands don't get as dry when I use this glycerin soap as opposed to regular soaps laden with chemicals and lards. But I always use a hand cream afterwards, preferably one of those gooey Burt's Bees creams that come in heavy glass jars. My hands never crack or get dry no matter how dry the air or how cold it is when I used Lush soaps and a good hand cream.

for its fresh, zesty, orangy smell.
generally, i prefer soaps to shower creams and lotions, cause soaps make me feel squeeky clean. but they also dry my skin out like crazy, so i try not to use them often.
but when i do, then it's one of my three favorites among lush soaps.
the fact that they are all natural and not tested on animals is added value in my world :

Smells like Xanadu!  I feel like grabbing my rollerskates, putting on some lip gloss and flying into another dimension! The forward note is tangerine/mandarin, for me. Followed by tiny fingers of vanille absolute with an earthy backbone. I absolutely hate patchouli. I know they say there is patchouli in here, but I can't detect it even as it wears throughout the day. Good lather, translucent fire orange color are stimulating. The soap goes well with the Karma Shampoo bar. This is one of my top 3 favorite Lush products.

I make my own hand and body soaps, so I'm pretty picky about anything store bought. I was given this as a sample with an order from Lush, and I loved it instantly! I haven't been able to duplicate the smell exactly in my own soaps, so I am willing to buy it just for that alone. I'm not a fan of patchouli in general, but it doesn't smell as strong on this soap. It blends very well with the other scents and smells divine! My entire bathroom smells great when it's hung up drying in the shower. I highly recommend it and have even given others karma as gifts, too

I love the pattern of squares on my 100 ml cologne bottle. Just one spray can make me feel utterly happy and clean. Im wearing shorts and a tshirt on this lazy Sunday and listening to Nick Drake, for some reason, his voice sounds even better with Brit sprayed on me. I know there's no logic but it's just how it is. This cologne can be described as a superstarter to one's eventful day, either at home whiling away time or when outside conquering the world.

It's funny and loveable how Amazon describes this fragrance by correlating it to British Men.(" Epitomizing the modern, British man, Brit For Men captures a relaxed elegance and effortless style.") I must say it makes me feel confident.

Thanks mom. You should go to Dubai more often and get me Burberry colognes.

This cologne is very spicy and is perhaps one of my favorites next to Burberry Fragrance for men. Whereas Burberry Fragrance was fruity, Brit is slightly different in that the scent is more floral and certainly more spicy (and yet not as heavy or as complex as London).

For something as spicy I'm quite surprised with how light this one comes across (in comparison with London which was just a little too heavy for me). I have to agree with other reviewers and say that it's still by far very masculine indeed. Vanilla is immediately noticed, as well as more fruity undertones which only increase as time passes ("juicy green mandarin," perhaps but you need to be a poet to sense it... again, admittedly sweet). Warning, this product is not nearly as citrus/lemon/orange the Burberry Fragrance; instead it follows in London's footsteps and provides spiciness in yet a more minimal way.

Can be worn in a similar fashion, either for formal affairs or casual ones, though I'd gather it is selected most often for casual ones (I did find a similarity between this and Chanel's Allure, and yet I find Allure much more pungent... I love Allure, but if you want something a little more mellow for the night, this is your product).

Sweet, spicy, deep and complex Brit marks itself as my second favorite from the Burberry line - sharing the spot right on top with the Burberry Fragrance! Can be worn daily without becoming tiring, a feature which I think it holds over Burberry Fragrance whose citrus-sweet Fragrance may become an annoyance

This cologne smells great! It is much more appealing than Chanel's Allure Sport, Versace's Blue Jeans, or Ralph Lauren's Polo.

If you like a slightly stronger, sophisticated scent, this is a great option

This vanilla-banana cream smells delectable, mostly light natural vanilla with a hint of fresh banana, and is a thick cream that works well and is very nourishing. It doesn't sink in anywhere near as quickly as Dream Cream or Skin Sin (or the now- discontinued Potion), but it works wonderfully for chronically dry skin. 

I apply it in a thin layer after a shower or bath in the morning and the moisture thins it out so it sinks in right away, and a thicker layer at night so it can sink in fully while I sleep.

The lotion works perfectly, but honestly, I buy it for the scent. It isn't often you can find such a naturally scented vanilla lotion. The banana is so light you can barely smell it, but gives an overall feeling of an ice-creamk or lovely dessert scent, rich and delicious.

I have a problem with most synthetic scents changing on my skin, and so I am pleased that Lush relies so heavily on natural plant essences and infusions.

This stuff is great for when my skin needs some hardcore moisturizing. It might feel greasy to some, but when your skin is very dry, it's not like that. If you feel it's too heavy for day wear, it does work great as a nighttime treatment. It sort of smells like oatmeal and vanilla ice cream to me

HI

<review_text>
I initially bought Sympathy for the Skin because of the smell (I just love it!) and for the reviews that I've read.  I was really excited to get home and try it, but was a little disappointed.

The lotion smelt wonderful, but when I used it, my hands felt like the lotion didn't really sink it.  Sympathy for the Skin left a slight shinny coat on my hands and felt a little oily.  At first I realized that I was using too much, so I started to use less and that really cut back on the oiliness.  Since I use this at night time, it's not that big of a deal, but I wouldn't use this as a day cream because it's a little to heavy for me.

Besides the oiliness, the lotion did work well and really helped to moisturize my hands, which are usually dry and cracked because of so much dishwashing.  I follow with LUSH's Lemony Flutter Cuticle Butter and my hands have never looked better.

Will try some of LUSH's other lotions first before I buy this again.  Overall good product

"Sympathy for the Skin"?  Hmmmmm, seems to me that consolation, condolences and commiseration should be extended to those who don't have a small tub of this at the ready.  They probably have to put up with dry, tight-feeling skin crying for a kind word or, better yet, a moisturizing body lotion.

Truth be told,  skin needs our utmost attention - summer, winter, springtime and fall.  In the cold months it's buried under so much warm clothing that it can't breathe or dehydrated by central heating.  In the warm months it's parched by the sun and blown dry by air conditioning.  Yet, it stays with us.

When we're having fun, our skin is not.  Did you have a ball dancing all night?   Think of how those tired tootsies feel in the morning.  Were you the belle of the beach playing volleyball in your teeny-weeny bikini?  Too much sun, eh?  Your skin took it not only on the chin but all over your toned bod.  It needs TLC.

"Sympathy for the Skin" is a rich, soothing potion of a lotion laced with healing ingredients such as Almond Oil, Cocoa Butter, Sandalwood Oil, Fresh Bananas.    Creamy in appearance it's a luxurious emollient that is absorbed quickly by your grateful skin and leaves a lovely subtle scent of vanilla.

There are those days when I must have a soothing hot bath, which I know depletes skin of moisture.  So, after bathing I simply pat skin with a towel and then smooth on "Sympathy for the Skin" while skin is still damp.  Works wonders!  That's what's known as having your soak and silky skin, too

I am 32 years old and have been using the Idealist system for about 2 weeks now and I have definitely noticed an improvement in the softness/clarity/blotchiness and overall appearance of my skin. I had acne as a teenager and I also have larger pores. The scars have diminished (not completely, mind you!) and my pores are much smaller. I also have sensitive skin and this system does not irritate my skin. My skin also tends to be flaky when irritated and the idealist system had taken care of the problem. My advice is that you must use the Idealist in the morning and at night for your skin to get the total benefit of the micro-d product. I tried using the Idealist only at night and the benefits were not as great. It's expensive, but worth it. By the way, I have been using the .5 oz. sample size of the micro-d and I still have plenty left after about 5 uses. So this stuff will last you a very long time. You only have to use it twice a week (use it any more and it will irritate your skin). 

The first time you use it, you may be a little uncomfortable as there is a definite warming sensation. It also felt a little uncomfortable and made my skin a little pink, but it subsided very quickly and it was all worth it in the end. 

Great product

I love Fresh's Sugar perfume and so I was busting to try this deodorant to match.  Not disappointed at all!!  It's great and smells exactly the same as the fragrance.  It's so more like lemon than sugar, but that's what is fresh about this which makes it perfect in summer time.  It glides on well and doesn't leave white marks at all.  When your body temperature is warm, the smell comes out more which I love and if you use it with the matching perfume, then you're going to smell great all day long.  I love this, but I use it only on weekends because it's too nice to use it all up only for work

This is excellent lip gloss. I agree with the previous reviewer. It lasts for a very long time, doesn't feel sticky or liquidy, and doesn't taste bad. Unfortunately, the price is painful at which to look and on the wallet, but it's worth it. I've only tried one color (because of the price) and I think it works very well with my natural skin tones (I use 'Cry Baby'). Next time you're looking for a new lip gloss, check out this one. It's definitely worth it

This is a great alternative to clumpy, mascara and clear mascara - it's in the middle of those two.  It's thin and doesn't clump AT ALL, nice and moist, quick drying.  No smell, and good for my sensitive eyes &amp; contacts.  It doesnt do much besides darken the lashes, though, nothing fancy, and it WILL come off if wetted/rubbed.  It won't run down your face, but it won't survive a good cry

This is my favorite mascara hands down.  I've used this for years now. Even if I do stray I always come back to it.  I use this in Jet Brown.  I think this is the most flattering color for me.  This mascara is phenomenal; it never clumps up on my eyelashes, looks phony, spikey etc.  It goes on perfect everytime and makes my lashes look natural, thick and full. I never can tell when a particular wand is getting old because it does not start to smell bad and it never clumps up like a lot of other mascaras do.  I highly recommend this mascara.  And I will always buy it as long as Clinique never discontinues it.

If you knew what was in your makeup, you'd be horrrified. Dr. Hauschka products are some of the best out there--they are made with the safest ingredients available, and they are of very high quality. I love all their products

I love this product.  It smooths on beautifully.  You don't ever feel like you have makeup on but it gives just the right amount of coverage and helps nourish and protect your skin.  I also love the growing and manafacturing practices of this company.  I would recommend it to anyone

I cannot say enough about this fantastic product.  Clinique has (probably) the best skincare system out there.  My face was a mess and other moisturizers had clogged my pores and caused terrible breakouts.  The moisturizing gel is the third step in their skincare regime.  First, you wash your face with the Clinique soap best-suited for your skin type (normal, dry or combination/greasy), then you follow it with their clearing lotion (ie exfoliant/astringent) and you (finally) apply this gel to your face and neck.  Their moisturizer is also available as a lotion for for drier complexions.  The gel is oil free and gets the job done, without clogging your pores, while working with its PH balance.  Highly reccomended!!

I received CD lip butter a few days ago and I love it. It naturally moisturizes your lips and makes them feel soft and buttery. It is not overly greasy or waxy like other lip balms. I would recommend it to everyone!

Even in the cold Midwestern weather I have oily skin that's prone to breakouts and this is a great product for oily skin.  It cleans and removes makeup but doesn't feel as though it's stripped my skin of all moisture.  It is a little pricey but it's worth it and you'll have great skin that doesn't still feel oily, or feel too dry, after you wash your face

"Highest of all the oils (Spiritual); approximately 320 MHz. It enhances the frequency of every cell, bringing balance and harmony to the body." ~Connie and Alan Higley

Many rose oils are reminiscent of a rose garden. This rose oil reminds me of a wild rose bush you would find in a cedar forest. There is a hint of comforting cedar wood with varied elements of fragrance not unlike a fine perfume. Spicy notes mingle with sweet rose perfection while delicate high points capture your attention. Of all the rose oils, this one has numerous elements to lift your mood and scent everything from bath products to laundry soaps. The highly concentrated oil will last for a long time. One drop of this in a spray bottle of spring or mineral water and you have a beautifully scented skin refresher. Put a drop on a  cloth and toss it in the dryer for rose scented towels. Add to your fabric softener or drop the tiniest amount on a card you are sending to a friend. 

The sheer value of this product is astounding when you consider how expensive rose oil can be. The high concentration is superior to all other rose oils I've tried and this is very affordable. In this case, you seem to get more than you paid for. If you are looking to add rose oil to your collection, this is the best one I've found for blending with other oils and making bath products and scenting products I use around the house. 

This oil will bring a poetic beauty to your life and can alleviate times of emotional upheaval. Use for dry skin (add to creams), addictive behavior, anger, despair, depression, grief, nervous anxiety, heart problems, emotional fatigue, irritability and insomnia. Since this is highly concentrated, you may want to blend it with jojoba oil first before mixing into beauty products. 

Caswell-Massey also sells a divine Egyptian Musk, Ylang Ylang and Lilac oil. Very affordable oils and unlike other brands were you have to almost pour the oils in the tub, a few drops will do. Highly Recommended. 

~The Rebecca Review 

P.S. The Aroma Vera Pearl Aromatic Pottery Diffuser with a cork lid is perfect with this product.

I have been using these since sometime in the early 1990s. Before the web made them easier to find, we used to ask family friends visiting Hawaii to pick them up for us. I've recommended them to many others over the years because they are easier than a back brush, more vigorous than a wash cloth, and quick-drying. The Salux brand is rougher (and I think better) than the imitations I have since seen

Long enough to wash your back, will wad up something like a pouf, but the texture is perfect! You will wonder why you've ever used a cloth to wash your body (not ideal for the face with sensitive skin).  Makes super lather from your bar or liquid soap.  Rinses clean after every use. It will spoil you! Lasts for years with daily use

I have tried many brands of lipstick, expensive and drugstore brands and this is the best lipstick I have found. I love the texture and sheer color. I was not certain if spending this much on lipstick would be worth it, but it definately was for me. No more searching...I found what I like and I will stick with it. Quality. That's this lipstick in one word

Chanel's Aqualumiere lipstick is, in my opinion, the best lipstick formula on the market. The lipstick goes on as shiny as lipgloss but has the texture of lip balm. The colors, though sheer, still have good pigmentation; the sheerness is actually a benefit because it allows the lipstick color to blend well with your natural lip color, lessening the chance that your lip color will come out looking unnatural. The Aqualumiere line of lipsticks do need to be reapplied more often than a less sheer lipstick, but the lasting power is still relatively high, and reapplication is less of a bother because of the lipstick's texture.

Though I have not tried all the colors, the pinks in this formula--Waikiki in particular--strike me as especially natural and face-brightening

I love these! Wore my last pair out. I love that you can put them on after moisturizing and let them stay on for about ten minutes and then remove them leaving you oil free. They are really great. I also use them when I am touching photos or silver so I don't leave oil smudges on them.

Creed Vetiver is the greatest cologne ever
Very attractive to men and women
The very first time I've used Creed was on New Year'eve 
Then went to few paces such as Whiskey Park, Armani cafe,mostly everyone were asking the same question"what kind of cologne you have on" Few weeks ago,I was at this Lounge call Saint almost 90% of the people asking the same question " I replied that's CREED  one of a kind" buy it now,you will be thanking me later

We purchasedthis for oil control on someone with acne-prone skin, and as a base for makeup on oily facial areas. It works great for both. It has a smooth, cool texture that feels refreshing when applied, and is absorbed quickly, leaving the skin soft and smooth. I highly recommend it for acne treatment! One note though- It must be used on a daily basis for results.

i received this scent(the mid-sized white bottle)for christmas 2006. it's beautiful! a really warm, vanilla-ish scent that lingers forever and is incredibly comforting and sexy as hell. this is a little much for office or casual wear, but i definitely think it would go over well for evening or a date-i've found that guys respond pretty well to it.

also-the packaging is exquisite. the bottles are solid fuschia, white, or orange and shaped like a decorative bud vase. i love the box the scent came in, white with some sort of pink and orange bird on it. i liked it so much that i actually store the perfume in the box rather than throw it away. a really, really special product

I just returned from a cruise on the Carnival Spirit.  I was given a sample in the gift shop.  I went back down to purchase it as I loved it.  Alas, they had carried 120 bottles on the previous cruise which they sold out of immediately as their price was so good.  Most perfumes are offensive to my sinuses but this one is not overpowering and the scent really is wonderful.  I just can't imagine someone not liking it.

This scent is very light and sugary. I enjoyed it because I prefer fragrances that are more spice-based than floral-based, and in this scent the note of sugared almonds stands out to me the most. It's a good summer scent because it isn't too heavy and it's very sweet.

I gave this a four out of five stars because while it was enjoyable, it just didn't have that certain 'something' that makes a fragrance truly memorable

This is a very fresh gel. I really felt the difference in my skin next morning. Actually, in my opinion, I don't need to apply "a cherry-sized ball" of gel to my face. If I do so, I feel my face a little sticky, however, a smaller amount of gel will let your skin feel comfortable and will do the work. It smells slightly of natural bergamote and hibiscus. I think is perfect for sensitive skin but if you are allergic to alantoine this gel is not for you. Thank you

I was never able to find a scent that wasn't too much flower or too much musk.  This one is perfect.  The scent is feminine but not too flowery and the bubble bath is very rich.  Only a little is necessary.

If you are a fan of subtle, high-quality scents, this product is for you. If you want to stand out with your fragrance (ie: We can all smell you from miles away) skip this scent. I'd also recommend Philosophy's Kiss Me gloss and any of their vesatile body washes. Enjoy

I love this! It has a powdery, clean smell that isn't overpowering- but even if it was, I could probably stand to smell it all day long! I used maybe about 1/4 of the bar, but it still made nice masses of bubbles! Unfortunately, the bubbles disintegrated pretty quickly...I didn't mind though, and didn't feel it was worth taking off a star, because it left my water scented and my skin soft. This is something I wish I could use at every bath

When the weather outside is blustery and ugly, I like nothing better than to get into a hot bath with half a sweet Hot Milk? bubble bar and a spicy Hot Java ballistic. It's one of my favourite Lush bath combinations, for an all-over warmth and general good feeling that will carry you into dreamland.

The deep purple color of this soap holds memories of grapes and lavender blossoms. In fact, the organic grapes in this product are from Provence. The main natural ingredients are lovely and include: Water, Lavender, Honeysuckle, Marigold, Grape Juice, Rosemary Oil, Thyme Oil, Lavender Oil and Rosebuds. I found the fragrance to be very elegant, like walking through a field of lavender along a paved path in high heels by the light of the moon in a chiffon gown. It is silky, sensuous and very relaxing. Recommended for romantics who dream of outdoor gardens filled with lavender and kisses by rosebushes.

I ordered this soap just because I thought it would look nice in my bathroom and not to really use. I do have to say, however, I am pretty tempted. One warning I do have to say is it was 90 degrees (F) outside the day this soap showed up. It was not melted but was pretty soft. We just let it sit for an hour in the AC and it formed right back up. It did take a while for this soap to show up though so dont order it if you dont want to wait

It seems as if it is working for me.  I notice a slight difference in the 2 weeks that I have been using it.  But on the bottle it says to use it for a month.  I have noticed, though that it makes my stretch marks more visible? I don't know if this could be caused by my tummy having more elasticity and firming because I am also working out, or from the product. However, it smells nice and is not sticky like I thought it would be.  Overall, it is a wonderful product and I would definately recommend it to anyone whose tummy was severly stretched during pregnancy

It is very delicate. Does not irritate the skin. Complexion looks improved after 2 or 3 times of using it. My friends notice the difference and the skin gloves. It is not easy to wash it off and you get a lot of hydrogen foam vs only few enzyme tablets(little minus for that),does not work toward acne but I'm still happy with it

This razor's best virtue for me is its ability to cut a thick beard without clogging like the multi blade cartridges out there. I always dreaded shaving after a hunting or fishing trip. Even the old Gillette twist-open requires that it be partially opened to properly rinse out the cream and whisker sludge. This guy has a nice round cavity underneath each cutting edge that allows water to wash everything away. Even shaking it in a bowl will clear it most of the time. If it should clog, one can blow it out quite easily. I have only used the lower settings, and they are all I seem to need with good blades. The Gillette blades sold in the US are horrible, BTW. Use Merkur blades or Swedish Gillettes for the best shave.

My only complaint is that the alignment marks to match up the top and body are faint, and the adjustment marks do not line up properly, and I am forced to do math to get repeatability. I have higher expectations for German engineering and the price.

This thing is overpriced for what it is, but a good shave is worth a lot, and you only buy it once

..Is Eau Des Merveilles, which I've been wearing for the past year.
I have tried and tested many, many perfumes over the years, and never really settled on one definitive scent personal to me.
 If a good fragrance is important to you, then you know the one you choose is key - I'm glad to say I have found it. 
And simply, if you wear Eau Des Merveilles once, both men and women, will complement you on how good you smell! Now, who can get bored of that?

This perfume contains all my favourite components especially vetiver, bitter orange and 'BALSAM of PERU'. It takes me away to where I want to be, (teases my imagination), even though I may sometimes be at a boring place or with boring people. It makes me smile, and I can't wait to start the day after wearing it :)

It's hard to find this product online on the places you'd think it would be like Sephora.com, Gloss.com or Neiman Marcus.com.  I am very happy to have found my favorite moisturizer on Amazon.com so now I don't have to brave the crowds in the brick and mortar Sephora or, let's say Saks Fifth Avenue where they hawk you like carnival barkers.  Even the Sephora salespeople have become more aggressive than their original philosophy of letting the customer browse uninterrupted.  This moisturizer is perfect if you hate anything greasy on your skin.  It's light, yet truly moisturizes and is the least sticky and stinky of any I've ever tried.  If you even get one or 2 pimples from other moisturizers, you won't have to worry about using this one.  Great for oily or combination skin.  I'm forty and I still love it!  Anything else slides off or makes me break out.   The only annoying thing is that my boyfriend uses most of it

To those of you saying "it doesn't last, I can't smell it half-way through the day", you're not supposed to be able to smell your own cologne, if you can, you've put too much on and will most likely offend people with your overbearing scent!!!!

It smells great and lasts as long as any other cologne I've tried

I swear, this bomb smells exactly like Fruit Loops cereal, which just happens to be my favorite cereal. Nice and fruity scent, with a hint of flowers in the background. It turns your water a pretty, pale apple green color. Oh and I didn't have any glitter in mine either, so don't worry all you glitter-phobes

kai gift set is complete - scent is very floral, like gardenias. be advised that the size of the kai roll-on perfume is smaller than a standard lipstick.  $40 is pricey for the quantity, but the roll-on is convenient and i carry in my purse - the spring-like scent is worth it!

I don't know how many mascaras I own but there's always about two or three that I hold as my favorite or just for different occasions. One of those is Hypnose and I really like it for when I go out or just looking for that dramatic look.

Postive:
1.) The look: I've never neccessarily wanted to wear fake eyelashes but they do look almost perfect. Unbelievably, Hypnose gives you that look. It's amazing just how feathery your eyelashes look.
2.) Flaking: This mascara never really flaked on the bottom of my eyes. That's really important to me.

Negative:
1.) This mascara starts out great but after about two and a half weeks it starts emptying out on you. This might just be because there were days when I reapplyed it or simply because I just used it pretty well (1 coat just about everyday because of how much I liked it).

Summary: If you want that natural yet "are those real lashes?!" look, then you'll like this mascara. I'm giving it four stars instead of five simply because of how long it lasts but if you use it once it a while, then it will last you a while

I have normal/oily skin and since I couldn't find another daily lotion for my face I tried Estee Lauder Daywear Plus SPF 15. I use it every day, I usually mix it with my foundation, so it wouldn't break out my skin. The lotion feels good and smooth. It also has a great fresh cucumber scent.I've used it for a while and am very satisfied.

These are just WAY too amazing!! I'm warning you now, if you buy them you will be addicted! I bought this set and split half of it with my best friend, and both of us are hooked and will be ordering a new set for ourselves again. You get so many flavors and they all taste like sugar and smell sooo great! My favorite is the "lemon custard" flavor; if Sugar made that flavor in a full-sized gloss, I'd buy 10!! These glosses are so delicious, you won't be dissapointed!

I add mild color to my hair with "Caca Marron" henna, and I like to use this shampoo in conjunction with a henna treatment.  I feel like it helps the color to set and gives it a good depth. Reincarnate itself does not add color but does add shine (most LUSH solids seem to do this for me)!

Solid shampoos can be intimidating if you have never used them before, but LUSH makes the experience fun and easy.  A little bit of this bar rubbed into your hair creates a nice lather and leaves your hair feeling fresh and clean.  A solid shampoo is also good for travel, as it doesn't spill or explode all over your luggage

Deepening the color and shine of your auburn or brunette tresses is quite possible without needing to use a hair color. Although, an initial coloring with Henna may be recommended, this extends the color and shine and can make your hair feel like it has more body and bounce. 

This is super fun to use in the tub and really works up a lather in your hair that is rich and moisturizing. Rhassoul mud conditions the scalp while Persian Henna gives you color. The scent is like an earthy apple cider with hints of orange and rosemary. Dry this bar out between uses by keeping it in a soap container. 

What I noticed most after the first use was how long my hairstyle lasted and how my hair had that "whish, whish" super clean feel. I also noticed a deepening of the color. If you have oily hair, this is a deep cleansing shampoo that will give you a lot more body along with the shine. Follow with a rich conditioner like LUSH American Cream or the earthy Jungle bar. 

Why are shampoo bars so much fun? This one definitely makes my lush favorites list. If you used one of the lemony shampoos (I Love Juicy) and it took out some of the color, this seems to work well to restore the color. 

~The Rebecca Review
I read the Lush Times like a novel...

P.S. A LUSH sampler would be fun to order!

Solid bar shampoos never sounded that appealing to me,but I thought I would give it a chance.I live in a hard water area and this lathers very well,and after about a week,I had faint highlights that where starting to show.The smell of this shampoo is herbal in base,and pretty much comes out in the rinse.Overall I thought I would never fall in love with a solid shampoo,but I did and it makes me want to try more of the Lush line of shampoos

This smells exactly like its name, vanilla apricot. This is positively addicting when you put it on.  The notes are not too overpowering or synthetic, it just smells good. You smell soooo delicious and when you put it on it makes you think of somewhere warm and sunny. I've been wearing it all this winter and living in Minnesota I need all the warmth I can get.  This also makes me happy when I put it on.  I highly recommend trying this.

Great scent for the middle of winter when you're dreaming of going someplace warm - great scent for summer when you are someplace warm.  The vanilla and apricot blend isn't too fruity, it just smells wonderful.  I wear this scent when I'm cranky and don't want to go to work - it cheers me up and makes me want to earn money so I can buy a plane ticket to Tahiti....I wear it a lot..

I've been using this face wash for about about a month now.  The first two weeks I noticed my skin was fairly dry, which was a nice change from being so oily.  It's a good face wash, and I will probably buy it again.  The only thing that's a little strange, and I read about it in another review, is the smell.  There is a slight sulfur smell right after I rinse off my face, but it really doesn't last long

This is an I-didn't-know-how-much-I-needed-it-until-I-bought-it review. For heaven knows how long I've been distributing conditioner throughout my hair with my fingers, massaging it in, thinking I was doing a thorough job. Not so! After using this Fekkai Detangling Comb the difference was amazing. Obviously, the mere use of fingers had not been able to release the conditioner as it should have been. 

The comb is handcrafted in France with wide teeth, smoothly rounded to protect hair. It's a beauty on its own, as you can see. It allows easy distribution of the product whether it's a conditioner or a treatment mask. It's a breeze to use in the shower and also ideal for comb-outs. 

Frederic recommends applying a conditioning treatment 1-2 times a week to maintain healthy hair. To date, I've been very well pleased with all of Frederic's products and his advice. This is a man who knows hair and how to care for it.

I first began using this product in 2003, when I had my first series of microdermbrasion treatments.  I use very little &amp; it WORKS!  The last place where I purchased this product no longer carries it &amp; they attempted to steer me to Walgreens, where, of course, it was not to be found.  I am 56 years old &amp; strangers that have never met me think I am in my eary 30's.  I am flattered but proud to be the woman I have grown to be.  It took me a while to find this on the internet, but now I have found it once more...I am HAPPY

I purchased this item because some of my lashes had fallen due to my adding warm compresses to my eyes because I had a bump on one of my eyes.  Anyhow, as they had fallen in sporadic clumps, I started looking on the internet for something to help them grow and thus found Talika Lipocils.  I added it to my few eyelashes, from the root up and didn't notice anything until about a month later.  When I did notice the growth and fullness it was kind of sudden.  I was thrilled.  For the first time since they fell I have added mascara to my eyelashes and they are the longest they have ever been.  All I can say to those that feel it doesn't work is that maybe you are not giving it enough time and hoping to see dramatic results in just a few weeks.  Please give it time, it does work... so much so that I am going to order more to ensure I never run out.

       It began following World War II at the ophthalmologic services of the Hospitals of Paris when Dr. Danielle Rochas developed a plant based anti-bacterial unguent to heal those who had suffered serious facial burns.  The results astounded, not only did this unguent heal but her patients' eyelashes grew back!

	So Talika was born and since 1948 these laboratories have produced remarkable products that reverse signs of aging on delicate eye skin.  I've been more than well pleased with my purchases from this French skin care company, especially with Eyelash Lipocils.  This is a plant-based gel that stimulates and replenishes eyelash growth.  It took about four weeks for my lashes to be longer and fuller.  I simply applied in the morning and at bedtime to clean lashes.  Thank you Talika!

	Among the efficacious ingredients in Eyelash Lipocils are Nettle Extract, Horse Chestnut, Allantoin, Soy Lecithin, Witch Hazel, St. John's Wart and Apple Extract.

While this palette is pricey and definitely luxe, it contains about every color anyone needs for every day--from blush to deep brown. The light center color can be used for highlighting under the brow, the darkest color can be used wet for a liner. If you buy just one palette, this might be a great choice

I've used this loose powder for 20 yrs (since high school) and while I have tried other brands from time to time I keep coming back to Clinique because it's the best. It offers great colors that work with all complexions, it has the best texture, goes on like a dream and leaves skin with a wonderful finish. It also has no offensive odor or perfumes. I am blonde with fair to medium skin. My complexion has golden undertones and can be sallow if I apply the wrong makeup colors. Transparency #2 works best for me. I would highly recommend this product

Oil Free and perfect for any skin type, Clinique's Blended Loose Powder has been a top seller and award winner in the prestige makeup category for decades. Each jar (fits on your palm) comes with a swivel out brush (retracted it's about three inches long) that can be used for application and or touchups. Inside the jar is a plastic screen that helps you keep the majority of the powder in the jar even during application -- wonderful for those of us who tend to drop and spill.

Special Tips For Use:
To get the most flawless finish, Clinique recommends an application technique they call the "powder rub down." Tip a tiny amount of powder from the jar into one hand. Very gently rub your hands together to lightly distribute the powder across both palms. Then use your hands to `wash' your face with the powder. This technique helps keep the hairs on the brush from pushing the powder into the pores, accentuating their appearance. Any excess you see afterwards can be whisked off with the swivel-out brush that comes with each jar. 

If you like to touch up with powder throughout the day but don't want to carry the jar or a pressed powder compact, simply dip your brush into the powder in the top of the jar, swivel retract the bristles containing the powder, pop the cap on top, and you can now drop the brush into your purse for a loose powder touch up any time. 

Color Notes: 
-Transparency 1: Has almost no discernible color. For the palest of the pale. This powder is only a hairs breath darker than baby powder.
-Transparency 2: This powder has a noticeable light pink tone. Excellent for perking up a sallow (yellowish) complexion. Also great for Asian women who want that porcelain look.  As a redhead, I find this color powder gives my skin the perk it needs without leaving me looking orange as so many others do.
-Transparency Neutral: Like Transparency 2 without the pink for when 1 is too light and 3 is too dark.
-Transparency 3: Clinique's most popular color . . . by far.  If you've ever received a sample in a Gift before, this is it. A very safe color to choose.
-Transparency 4 Plus: A little darker than the old Transparency 4. For when you have a tan or if you're olive or Hispanic without much of a tan.
-Transparency 5: For when you're dark naturally. A big jump from Transparency 4 Plus. Dark Hispanics and the well tanned fit well here.
-Transparency 6: For dark complexions such as African American, though won't be dark enough for the darkest of dark.
-Transparency Bronze: For all skin colors. Although all the other colors are matte in finish (no shine, glisten, or sparkles) Transparency Bronze is the exception. This color is a deep bronzing powder that goes on the skin surprisingly light and with a hint of sheen for that sun-kissed look. Very pretty applied to the cheeks with just a tiny hint on the forehead, nose, and chin

My background:

I used a Gillette Sensor. It was okay. I upgraded to Sensor XL. It was pretty good. I tried a Mach 3, and I hated it -- it felt like I was wiping my face with a wall of blades. I finally settled on Sensor 3 -- at nearly 2 bucks a blade. It got the job done, but there was no real joy in shaving. Considering I have to do it at least once a day (twice if I'm going out at night) the process should be more enjoyable.

After quite a bit of research, including newsgroups and customer reviews, I splurged and got the Merkur Futur (though I got the chrome finish). 

Shaving is awesome, and I literally look forward to it. Lathering up the shave cream (I use Crabtree and Evelyn Sandlewood) with this brush is a real treat. Super soft, holds a ton of water, and results in a thick lather. (Be warned, the first few times you use it, it stinks like wet badger... but it goes away).

The razor itself is heavy... I mean heavy. Which is good, because you need to let the razor do the work -- NO PRESSURE, OR YOU WILL TAKE OFF YOU FACE). The main difference between this razor and shaving with cartridges, is that you actually feel the blade against your face (as opposed to a chunk of plastic).  Anyone who has had a shave with a barber knows how great this feels.

Once I got the technique down it is as close and smooth a shave as I have ever had. Finishing up with a cold water splash, non-alcoholic toner / aftershave, and a moisturizing lotion, is an invigorating way to start the day.

Please note: as stated above the brush smells a little "badgery" at first, but it goes away. The head of the razor does not pivot, so you have to follow the contours of your face. And the head itself it bulky, so you have to work on your technique around your nose, and under you chin.

In sum, this razor adds an old-school, refreshing routine to my mornings. I love it, and would whole-heartedly recommend it.

Have had this for about 2 years now, switched from the run of the mill razors to this and have never been happier, The bush holds up great and the razor is heavy and makes it feel as if you ae using a solid piece of equipment, which you are, very little maintainence on the razor, change the blades and rinse when changing.  Will not go back to disposable type again

This is a fantastic de shaving kit for wet shaving.  It seems expensive but however when you do the research and look for these items individually its not that pricy.  The razor sells for $60 the brush $80 and the stand $65.  I purchased this for  myself for Christmas 2006 and could not have been happier.  I have always had problems shaving with irritation and ingrown hairs.  With a proper shaving technique and some patience you'll be getting the best shave of your life.  The razor is adjustable meaning you can change the closeness of the blade for different shave settings( 1 to 6 progressively closer) and this razor scores highly on shaving review boards.  I would highly recommend this kit it looks great and is a essential to proper mens grooming.  Pick this up with some high quality shaving cream (Taylors of old bond street, trumpers, truefitt &amp;hill) and a quality aftershave and enjoy.  Shaving can be an awesome experience, something you look forward to.  [...

During my seven year shaving career, I've run the gauntlet of shaving implementations.  After shaving with contemporary disposable cartridge razors and electric razors with `goo', I was left with much to be desired.  Ingrown hairs and razor burn were starting to be a little too familiar.   

Upon taking the set out of the box, I was met by quality and heft from each piece and went straight to the sink for a test drive.  I didn't receive my Art of Shaving lavender scented shave cream until the day after, so I made do with the Aveno shave gel I had on hand.  The first thing I experienced while working up a lather with the badger hair brush, was the distinct smell of wet badger.  After a thorough washing and rinsing, the badger smell had subsided enough to continue.  I had read a few guides from classicshaving.com on the proper technique, but really there was nothing to it.  I made sure my skin was taught and let the weight of the shaver do all the work.  I found that it didn't take much longer than a normal shave, even on my first go.  It took me two weeks of shaving to get my first knick.  At that point, I was getting a little complacent and placed the razor on my chin at an odd angle.  It was very minor and I haven't repeated the folly.  

The smell of wed badger totally subsided after about three days of use; replaced by the soothing smell of lavender.  I'm looking forward to trying out other shave creams.  While the Art of Shaving cream provides adequate lather coverage, I feel that it could be thicker.  I am, however, only comparing it to contemporary shave gels, whose thousands of dollars of R&amp;D could produce incomparable lather results.  I foresee me and my Futur in a life long relationship.  

I asked my dad why he never told me about the satisfaction you can get from a good double edged wet shave.  He said, "I don't know.  I guess it's just been so long since I've used one.  Right now, I'm using one with 4 blades that vibrates."  Guess what he got for father's day.

This is the best hairspray I've ever used! It goes on with a fine mist, that dries fast, so you can shape you hair, then spray again to set it. It's not stiff, yet the hold is amazing and I have very hard to hold baby fine hair. It's not cheap, but once I tried it, I can't live without it!

This is one of the most perfect concealers I have ever used. It goes on nice and creamy (does not pull on your skin when applying) and covers those imperfections.  You also do not need a lot of product to get the job done.  The colors are very natural and I have found a perfect color in Sand for me. I will buy this product again.

I was reluctant to get this one because it was one of the few I was already familiar with from the ole high school days, for many of the same reasons the other reviewer stated, it's been around for a long time and many already have good or bad associations with the scent and other guys who have worn it. I can understand why he gave it three stars, but I'm here to review it based on its scent and merits and not the pop-culture story that surrounds it. 
The fact is, Guy Laroche nailed an almost perfect scent right at the eve of the fragrance for men explosion. While its Polo Green counterpart tended to smell more to me like a pesticide in the bottle, this cologne is both decidedly masculine and decidedly beautiful at the same time. It has elegance and blatant animalism. It is musky and spicy without being floral or citrusy. The age and popularity and generation (zeroing in on age) associated with it will probably prevent me from overusing it, but it still ranks very high in scent tests from woman, possibly continuing to be the best fragrance out there. As for the synthetic scent the other reviewer mentioned, this is probably of the last made before the manipulation of benzene aromatics very common in most newer colognes that he probably likes a lot. Most likely its the lack of organic citrus notes that caused the statement. 
It's not hip or the newest thing, but damn does it smell GOOD!

These tweezers rock! This gets all the hairs you want gone fast and effectively. This is also easy to manuever around the eyebrow area.  I can get into spots and get the hairs I could not get with any of my other tweezers which I have since gotten rid of.  This is worth the money.  These tweezers will last and last and you will not be disappointed. You can also choose from a variety of cool colors too. I highly recommend these tweezers.

Tweezerman tweezers are by far the best tweezers I've ever purchased. They stay sharp for an incredibly long time making tweezing precise, quick and virtually painless. And when they do go dull, all you have to do is send them in for a free sharpening and in a week or so, they arrive back good as new. You can't beat that!

Tweezerman tweezers are simply put - The Best - with capital letters!  I bought my first pair at Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond 2 years ago and I just now broke down to buy another pair because I couldn't even go without them long enough to send them in to be sharpened for free! I tell all my friends (and after one use of mine, they agree) that once you use a Tweezerman you realize that no other tweezers out there even come close to their quality or how well they work.  I have had to fight them out of the clenched fists of quite a few of my friends who have wanted to borrow them. How many times do you make "Rules" for a pair of tweezers?  My number one rule? You can use them, but not take them out of my presence!!  Definitely worth the money - in spades!

Tweezerman really are the BEST tweezers on the market and to say, the cutest. With different colors to choose from, the fact that they're reliable and strong only adds to them.

Tweezers gone dull and you need them sharpened? You don't need to go to the store anymore and buy new ones. Tweezerman sharpens them free of charge with S&amp;H so long as you send in an envelope.

My final point: I don't see a point in buying any other tweezer since you buy one pair and it lasts you the rest of your life

The make-up is very good quality and the colors are pretty, but they are a little too dark for someone fair-skinned.  The lighter colors aren't quite as light as they appear, so the whole effect is a bit dark.  It was a big sell at the store, though, so I think this is only a negative with some people

I have been using it for... uhh.. fifteen years?! 
It is the best blend of sweetness, spice, musk and character I have ever smelled.
There are so many perfumes, especially in the last decade, being launched, and they all smell so similar! They have so little character, and if they do, then they are either too weird, or too something. Or they give me a headache.
This one is unique. Guaranteed.

People who know me know that I am around or close by whenever they smell a trail of Obsession perfume somewhere near my home or office.

I started using Calvin Klein's Obsession when I was a freshman in college, back in 1992, and have used it ever since.  It's served me extremely well the past 14 years as I love the way it smells.  

The scent is, in my perspective, strong but sweet.  It is my favorite of the entire Calvin Klein collection, with Eternity a close second, and I buy it every chance I get whenever I'm going perfume shopping.  

I highly recommend it - well worth your money and a fabulous scent to be wearing.

gives you a natural, sensuous pout as opposed to thick layer of color (which some lipsticks require) that can only make your face look sharp. not a good (smart) sharp, but opposite of sweet and feminine sort of sharp.
tastes and smells nice too :)

Mania should definately be one of your "Eau de Toilette" spray. It is definately strong and manly - not to be worn to the office. It is a great evening , romantic, or weekend spray to share with those around you! I would recommend trying it first  since everyone chemistry and tastes are different so give it a spray  the next opportunity you walk by a department counter

When I tried a sample of the shampoo and conditioner I had no idea that the next time I went to wash my hair, it would feel completely different. I had my hair up in a bun (I had put it up to workout) and when I let down my hair after it was dry it felt so much thicker and almost like I had more hair.

I was not quite sure why, but then I read about the strengthening effects of this shampoo and conditioner. My hair also felt so much cleaner and silky as if there was no build up and I had washed my hair in mountain spring water.

Ingredients in Shampoo: Water, Rice Bran, Rice Oil, Coconut Oil, Seaweed, Ginseng, Aloe, Wheat Powder, Swertia Herb.
Ingredients in Conditioner: Water, Rice Bran, Rice Oil, Coconut Oil, Seaweed, Ginseng, Aloe, Wheat Powder, Swertia Herb, Natural Vitamin E.

Since this product is relatively expensive, I may have to alternate it with other shampoos and conditioners, but it definitely works. The shampoo doesn't strip the hair the way other harsh shampoos do and I'm very impressed with the natural ingredients cleaning my hair so well. If you have fine or oily hair you may be especially impressed. You also only have to shampoo once, which saves time.

Results after one use:

Smoother Texture
Stronger Hair
Cleaner Hair
More Body - especially if you have fine hair

Looking forward to trying other products with rice bran. You can order a week's supply of this product to try. I think you will fall in love with the shampoo and conditioner.

I have trouble to remember to put on sunscreen in summer on my face, and I don't think the moisturizers that purport to have sunscreen last all day. The Shiseido compact is a powder that can be used wet or dry and it has a lot of sunscreening power. It has a physical block and blocks UVA and UVB.

It's not easy to find a match (mine is darker than I typically use in liquid) but it goes on fairly sheer if you want to apply it dry. The compact itself is a very pretty beachy dark aqua and has a compartment for a sponge to use wet or dry. The refill means you get plenty of use from the compact. I really use this a lot in summer and find it's easy to carry and reapply for maximum sun protection

I have had dark circles since I was young. As I got older (Im 38 now) it seemed to get darker. I am a makeup artist by profession, so believe me when I say that I have tried all kinds of concealers. Some went on smooth but the coverage didnot last and by mid-day there were those dark circles again. I literally had to carry concealer with me because I had to reapply atleast 3 times a day. The heavier concealers worked when I put them on but after awhile it would cake under my eyes, dry out and make my lines more visible and really made me look older! I was hesitant about Hylexin, like everyone, because of the price. I started using it but didnt see any results after few days. I guess it didnt help that I was constantly looking in the mirror.I started to get disappointed but kept on using it. I swear by the 3rd-4th week I could actually see a difference! My circles were way lighter and less noticeable! I dont have "bags" or puffiness, just dark circles and I have olive skin. As I continue to use it, it seems to be getter better and better. It might not take it away completely, but it sure has faded enough that I can now use a concealer (or just a fuller coverage foundation!) and not have to worry about it fading or caking. I feel bad that some people may not have gotten the results that they hoped for, but what do you have to loose! Yeah $95 is alot, but its cheaper and not as invasive as surgery. And it has the same 50/50 chance as cosmetic procedures. Everyones skin is different and reacts differently like any other skincare/cosmetics product. Also, you need to follow the instructions exactly! I applied twice a day and didnot skip any application. I tried very hard to stay out of the sun and used my same skincare routine. I will post another review in a few weeks and see if the circles improved anymore.  I hope this review has helped

I have had dark circles for many, many years.  They did not totally go away after using Hylexin, but they faded a great deal.  I am very fair so this might work better on people with fair skin, as several of the negative reviewers seem to have had darker skin.  BEST RESULTS were on the puffiness under my eyes, which had gotten much worse since I got a little older.  The skin under my eyes no longer sags at all, and superficial wrinkles are definitely minimized.  I feel like I look a lot better after using the product for several months.  I started out with a half-size product from a combo trial pack, and I liked it so much that I've bought the full size product now.  It last forever, so it's really not that expensive over time.  I think it's worth a try for people with similar problems to mine.  I guess everyone's different, but I've been quite happy with the product

I have had dark circles my whole life.  I have bought and tried every type of concealer that is on the market. I get enough sleep, eat fairly decent and drink tons of water and I still have dark circles.  I read about Hylexin in a few magazines so I thought I would give it a try. I bought it thinking if it works great, if not, oh well.  So, I bought Hylexin at a department store about three months ago. After the first two weeks I didn't see any change. I kept using it and after four weeks, I could see a visible change.   I am still using it and I swear it keeps getting better.  It's expensive but it works. I would recommend Hylexin to any one with dark circles.

After first application you can notice reduction in pore size. After 6 months of use I am very satisfied with this products (all Shiseido Pureness line). Apply as instructed by beauty consultant or packaging - should be used as last "cream" before makeup application. Avoid eye area and mouth.

HI

<review_text>
I have used Avon ANEW RETROACTIVE+ 2-in-1 Cleanser for months now, and I really like it.  Haven't had any recent breakouts and I love that this product really gets your skin clean.  I only use this product in the moring (I use something different at night) but plan to switch to morning use once my night product runs out.    

Though a little expensive for what you get, still an overall good product.  I will be switching to the individual AVON cleanser and AVON toner, only because I've read that using a 2-in-1 cleanser/toner is not as effective as using them seperately.  Besides, the Avon ANEW RETROACTIVE+ 2-in-1 Cleanser cost $12.00 for 4.2 oz, where the cleanser and toner by themselves cost $12.00 each but you are getting 5.1 oz.  So you are getting more for your money if you buy them seperately

Although its a bit more pricey than other cleansers, this product really helped clear my acne, oily face, and prevented further skin blemishes such as signs of aging on me, as well as my boyfriend's face. What's also great is that it seemed to tightened our face up, but not so much where it had a drying effect. We have tried everything from Neutrogena to Clinique and this product has been effective for us. I would be happy to recommend this product to anyone who has the same problems

I bought this stuff after reading all the great reviews.  My hair was 4b and very thick.  I hadn't had a perm in almost a year and a half.  I put it in myself and followed the directions exactly.  In the past, I've had really bad problems with relaxers burning my scalp to the point I've had scabs all over my head.  That's another reason why I tried this product.  It did burn, but not NEARLY as bad as other relaxers my stylist has used.  It was extremely manageable and not very uncomfortable.  I only left the product on my hair for the 25 minutes it recommends.    It took something like 12 shampoos for the stuff to neutralize.  My hair turned out curly instead of straight.  Guess I didn't "smooth" well enough.  I would def recommend to have a stylist put it in for you so you get the great results.  My hair looks really great flat ironed, but the true test will come after I've had the perm in for a few weeks.  My hair typically breaks off really bad right around the time that I need a retouch.  I am hoping that doesn't happen w/this product.  That will really let me know if it's worth the 60 bucks

Product came on time.  I bought this a second time for a retouch and I am pleased with the results.  It is pricey but worth it.  i leave it on as long as I want to straighten it to my desire. With this product u have the freedom to do that, it will burn your scalp though, but that is after 40min, if you base it right, which I do.  When ur hair gets wet it doesn't really curl up, it frizzes out a lil, not like when you have a regular perm. Sometimes my hair looks flat though, needs volume.  My hair was really coarse when it was natural, now very straight and healthy

I agree with the person who wrote that it is "by far the most expensive relaxer" I've ever bought but it is worth it. My mum was the one who found it and I'm eternally grateful to her as it worked out fantastic. Thanx Mum :) 

I am used to using various box relaxers from the store (Gentle Treatment, TCB, Dark and Lovely etc) and none of these come close. I have a combination of European/Carribean hair which is thick and coarse and so I need a really good relaxer to make it soft and straight.My hair has never been this straight from a box relaxer and it actually moves! :)

There is none of the usual "burning" sensation that often goes along with most relaxers. Nor is there a strong overwhelming smell that is enough to knock you out.

The quantity of the contents is great aswell. There are very few relaxers that you find with enough Conditioner provided to be used again later on.

It is well worth the price.My personal experience gave Salon results at a slightly cheaper price yet more expensive than those sold at Walgreens. I'll stick with the Phytorelaxer.

I am an African-American female with long, thick hair.  I relax and highlight my hair, so imagine the hell I was in when I heard that you should not chemically treat your hair when you are pregnant.  I tried to go along with that, however after 8 weeks I was in dire need of something.  I searched the web for a safe product and found this relaxer.  After rinsing it out and using the phyto shampoo and conditioner I was horrified with the fact that my hair felt like straw.  I rewashed it with Keracare shampoo and conditioner and it felt normal again.  The phyto relaxer did the same thing as a cheap drugstore relaxer, however it has a pleasant scent and doesn't burn your scalp.  After doing 2 or 3 relaxers myself I started to notice breakage.  But I assumed that it was from being pregnant.  I stopped doing my own relaxers when my belly started to weigh me down entirely too much.  I called Phyto and they gave me a listing of salons that use the relaxer on clients.  The salon I went to explained to me that I didn't understand placement when it comes to relaxer.  I was pretty much overlapping the product onto previously relaxed hair.  The instructions say not to do it, but it is really hard to control that.  I continued going to the salon for the relaxers and my hair grew back.  
Now a year later, I continue to use the salon and the product.  I am breastfeeding my son, so I stay away from the chemicals still.  I suggest this relaxer to all of my pregnant friends that don't want to walk around with crazy hair.  I mean pregnancy makes you feel bad enough

I'm 28 and have always had what I would call average skin, the kind that most women have. I have normal skin with a little more oiliness in the T-Zone and I get blackheads and the occasional breakout. I have tried all kinds of different product lines (Urban Defense, DDF, Dior, Philosphy, Bliss, etc.) and am the happiest with the results I get from Murad. 
I can't review just one product because I think the combination is what gives me such great results. I have been using Murad for about 2 1/2 years now so I have tried a lot of the Murad products and found a routine that works great for me. 

In the morning I use the AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser (love it! the gritiness gives you very smooth surface for applying makeup) then the Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel and the Skin Perfecting Lotion which I mix and apply together so that I don't use as much. Last I put on my Moisture Silk Eye Gel and I'm ready to go.  

At night I use the Clarifying Cleanser followed by the Clarifying Toner, the Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel, the Perfecting Lotion and the best product of all the Night Reform Treatment (see my review of that product for details, I love it!) and again I use the Moisture Silk Eye Gel. 

Once a week I throw in the Exfoliating Fruit Enzyme Mask and I have perfect skin if I stick to the program everyday. My skin looks and feels better than it ever has and people always guess my age to be around 23 so it must be doing something right! 

Top 5 Favorite Murad Products:
1. Soothing Lip Therapy
2. Night Reform Treatment
3. Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel
4. AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser
5. Clarifying Cleanser

Murad Products that I don't like:
1. Day Reform Treatment (too greasy and I hate the smell)
2. Purifying Face Scrub 
3. The products for combination skin - they are ok but the acne line is so mild that people with combination skin will see better results using it. (I have used both product lines)

This is a nice eye cream but it is way to expensive!   I wish it were 20 bucks instead of 50 bucks but then again Murad products are very high quality.  I only have been using this eye cream for a month and I do notice that is makes my eye area very mosturized.  I am sure if I use this for a long time I will see more benefits....so yeah this is a good qaulity product.  I will continue to use it...but I am not sure if I will rebuy because it is so expensive

I highly reccomend this kit. I am an esthetician that has lots of trouble with hormonal breakouts on my chin, jawline and neck. I had been using a system with benzoyl peroxide that was just too drying, even though I do have an oily skin type. This kit is great. All of the products are full size (except the samples of the peels). The products are very concentrated, so I expect that this kit will last around 3 months. I noticed an immediate difference in my skin - brighter, firmer, healthier glow. I've now been using it for two weeks. I've had a few hormonal breakouts (right before my period) but they are very small and clear up much faster. It is really getting rid of  red scarring left over from previous breakouts and my fine lines around my eyes are certainly decreasing too. The sample peels in the kit are awesome. You can get 2 peels out of each sample set - so about a total of 6 treatments. I reccomend using the peels 2X week to get you started - it really kicks up the results

It wasn't really big enough for the morning coverage with the face color, but it is a wonderful touch-up brush to use for your compact.  I have mixed some warmth, pink gossimer, tinted mineral vail in my compact and it is good refresher late in the afternoon or before meeting coworkers afterhours

I purchased this mask on the recommendation of a friend, who loves it. I've been using the mask two or three times a week for the past month - it leaves my skin hydrated and rosy. While it doesn't purport itself as an acne treatment, my skin overall looks much brighter and heathier. It also makes my face tingle pleasantly. 

I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a skin pick-me-up! It is worth the investment.

This product I use after I wash my face, I leave on for the instructed five minutes, then I rinse then apply my night gel (any product cream), However, I have been using this for the past three weeks, and I have already been told by friends that my face looks great, and what have i been doing different..  So with this I give this product a thumbs UP!!

Scent is my favorite self-indulgence. The way I figure it is that I may not be able to afford the finest clothes, the finest handbags, or the finest cars, but I can certainly afford the finest scents, and this is one of them. I first encountered Kai on a visit to L.A. Actually, I bought it in a flower shop. You know that fabulous smell that hits you when you walk into a high-end florist, the one that makes you feel as if you are instantly on vacation? That's Kai. I own the perfume and the body lotion. The perfume oil in particular is a very small size, but a little goes a long way. I get compliments every time I wear it. You deserve it, too

I've never done a review online for a product-but I can't rave enough about Khoret Amen Hair Oil.  I've been using that along with the Healthy Hair Butter with my relaxed hair and it's fabulous! It's great for moisturizing your scalp and ends (just use a little dab though-it is oil so don't over do it!). Plus, my hubby really, really likes the scent

I like everything in this set.  I have colored treated, oily hair so I was kind of concerned that this wouldn't work for me, but it does! I just don't use too much if it. I have been washing my hair with the Shine and protect shampoo and conditioner twice a week (I washed my hair everyday, but I can't wash it everyday with Ojon because it would be too heavy). My hair looks longer since I have been using this product and it seems healthier and shinier. it smells sort like gum or push-ups. I will definitely be buying full sizes of these when I run out. The leave in glossing cream I used every time I wash my hair. The tube size is 2 oz (the same as the shampoo and conditioner) but, it takes so little for my hair that I think it will last six to eight months and it really does work. This is probably the best glossing cream ever (certainly for oily hair)- it's better than Kiehls and Frederic Fekkai and they are both really good. I also use the  shine and protect glossing mist when I "do" my hair (straightening iron or rollers). It works well and makes my hair glossy not greasy and stringy. The last product is the Restorative hair treatment I have used it once and it's conditioning and trufully it does smell strongly (like baby oil and dirt? coffee grounds? ashes?) But, I really didn't notice that the smell lingered after I washed my hair and I think if used it on dry hair you would have really good results

A little pricey, but well worth it.  Gives me a charge in the morning and really wakes me up!  Makes you feel cool and tingly all over and I find that I just want to keep on scrubbing!!!  Great product for the summer, b/c the cool feeling you get even lasts for a while after you get out of the shower.  Also, it seems to be concentrated so you don't need a lot of it.  Would have liked it even more if it were a little more moisturizing.  If not for that, and the price, I would have given it a "perfect 5" score

Ok, we all have to shampoo and we've all tried hundreds of products.  This one by Aveda is heavenly. The scent is almost as sweet and fresh as a brand new baby - you know, ladies.  It's bliss.  You just close your eyes and inhale the loveliness of it. Plus, it cleans hair well, leaving it soft and fresh, full.

The shampoo is bliss. Find it, buy it, use it.
At least try it once. An upforgettable experience in the shower

I give this product 4.5 stars. I have long wavy/straight hair. It gets really frizzy in humid weather and I used to use John Frieda serum, and that worked well for me. The bottle was just really small and I would run out fast because of my long hair. I decided to buy this product. It has a thinner consistency than John Frieda's serum but it works just as well. It does make my hair soft and it tames the flyaways, but I would not use this product alone in my hair. I usually put a little of this on before I blowdry, a little afterwards and then I put Bed Head's after party in my hair before I straight iron my hair. Both the bed head and Biosilk really sink into my hair and gets absorbed and never looks greasy. After I do that, my hair is super soft. 
I like that the bottle is a good size considering you only need like a dime sized amount but I think it is a little pricey. But considering how long it will last, I think it is worth it. I would never use this on my skin (It says you can use this on your skin) just because I would feel like I am putting oil or something on my skin. And it also smells a little like hair spray, but it is not overpowering. Once you put it in your hair, you cannot smell it. All in all, a great product.

Smells great, detangles wonderfully and conditions well without a heavy product build-up feel.  I typically use Silk Therapy closer to my relaxer salon appointment as my roots grow in and my hair tangles more easily.  I run a quarter sized amount through recently washed/conditioned towel dried hair and it detangles everything -- much less breakage as a result.  Excellent as a secondary conditioner and detangler

What can I say, I also have long tight curls and I got so frustrated with the frizz in the humidity that I went back to BioSilk Therapy again.  I trimmed my hair and instead of letting it go curly I decided to straighten it and put a soft curl in with curling iron.  The BioSilk Therapy makes my hair baby soft and protects it from flat irons and curling irons.  Its like I have a totally different head of hair.  This is the best thing out there for curly hair and believe me I tried a lot

Biosilk is with out a doubt the best product on the market for your hair! I have used it for a few years now, and my hair is in the best condition it has probley ever been in. I have very thick, curly hair that I regularly straighten with a CHI hot iron and color treat, so my hair is rather prone to damage. Before I used this product, my hair was FRIED! It was dry, crispy, and always smelled burnt from straighting it. It was pretty bad. When I went to get my hair cut, the hair dresser made a comment on how badly damaged my hair was. I told her it was from straighting and coloring my hair, and she told my about Biosilk. I little bottle came with the CHI I bought, but I had never bothered to use it. She told me to apply a little bit of it before the next time I straighten my hair to see if it helped. After my first use, my hair was noticably softer, shinier, and less frizzy. So, i continued to use it. It worked even better after I used it for while. It improved the overall condition of my hair, and has made it so much more managable. Another great thing about Biosilk is the subsatnce of it. It has thick, watery like, smooth feel to it. I use about a quarter-sized amount after a shower on wet hair, and right before I style on dry hair. It is so light weight, I can't even tell I have anything in my hair. Because I don't have to use very much, a bottle lasts me for several months. Sure its a little expensive, but it is defenitly worth it! I recommend it to anybody with troublsome hair, or anybody who just wants great-looking hair. I promise, you will love it!!!!!!

If I was given a choice of any other mascara for free I wouldn't take it. If I was forced to choose just one item of make-up (God forbid!) I would take this mascara. I experiment with other beauty products but am totally loyal to Defincils. It goes on perfectly from root to tip, separates and makes lashes look long, long, long. It doesn't clump or flake. The name is appropriate because it really does define and that gives the eyes a beautiful open appearance. Lancome is known for making the best mascara and the reputation is well deserved. And if you really want dramatically flutterable lashes try putting on Lancomes base                                    coat which makes lashes fuller too and lengthens. Since I have given other products five stars I wish I could give this six. It's THE best thing in my make-up arsenal

I have tried tons of other scents, around 20 and I hadn't quite found anything that really fit me yet. So nice when you first spray it, the extreme has like a gin or juniper scent, real manly and real clean but not at all like aftershave. After about fifteen twenty minutes it gets real polite like a clean vanilla but not at all like a flower. It smells soft and super wafty almost like a less sweet Burberry but not at all like baby powder. 
   floaty non intrusive and not too sweet. If you hate the strong aftershave smell and the cotton candy machine smell as much as I do or you find yourself spraying cologne on more than once a day then this is your best bet.

don't buy it here you can get it on the cheap off ebay

I have been getting irritated skin / razor bumps / ingrown hairs (the whole nine yards) ever since I started shaving.  I've tried different cartridges, different methods of shaving, and even a cutthroat razor (had to give that up right away -- much too much maintenance).  However, with the purchase of this Merkur HD safety razor, I've finally found a product that I can stick with.  People say it takes some getting used to, but I found it not the slightest bit more difficult than shaving with a cartridge razor.  I get the closest shaves ever with it, with practically no irritation.  Other pluses include blades that last nearly a week and only cost 50 cents a piece!!  With cartridges costing up to three dollars, it's time to go old school (especially since I'm a poor college student).

I can't compare this model to other safety razors, but I can say that it is a great intro safety razor.  Good weight, and simple to use.  I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone fed up with the cost of cartridges, and looking for a simple, effective solution

All I have to say is wow.  I'm 24.  My first razor was the same kind of DE razor that my dad used (some Gillette).  Around 17 the mach 3 came out and since the full knowledge of shaving was never really handed down to me, I opted for the mach 3 which was easy to use and gave a decent shave.  I've essentially stuck with the Mach 3 until now, but being generally unsatisfied with the closeness of my shave I decided to investigate and turned back to the safety razor picking up this Merkur HD.  I just used it for the first time and it turned out to be significantly more satisfying than I had hoped it would be.  I nicked myself a few times without really noticing so there's some learning curve but as of now I've only used it once and I can tell you that it won't take long to get it down. 

A couple thoughts:
1) I'm really glad that I went for an HD.  I thought the HD may be heavy (and it may be compared to other DE razors) but I wouldn't want it to be any lighter.  It already feels light in my hand.

2) The biggest thing to keep in mind about the shave is that the razor cuts by keeping it perpendicular to your skin.  The most notable difference between shaving with the Mach 3 v. the Merkur HD centered around this.  With the Mach 3 I kind of feel like I have to drag the blade across my skin (kind of scraping it) to get a close shave (which can be done and I don't notice that much irritation).  That said most of the shave with the HD was as close, but since the aim is to keep the blade perpendicular, the razor felt more like it was gliding over the skin. Very nice.

3) To put in a new blade you unscrew the bottom and the top part comes off.  You pop in the blade, put the top back on and screw the bottom to tighten the top.  

It should be noted that I've started shaving at night so that I can tell what I'm doing (I'm not a morning person) so in the morning if I'm not really going to pay attention the Mach 3 may still be better.  Also, I'm using cheap soap and a boar brush from CVS until the stuff I ordered comes in so with any luck it will be even nicer next time

I recently took the plunge back to DE razors with this one.  I have since picked up some old Gillette's on eBay.  I've been thinking I might as well have stopped with this razor.  It produces a nice close shave and I don't seem to create as many nicks and cuts when using it

This is the ideal razor to start shaving with if learning to use a double edge safety razor.
There are no adjustments to cause confusion, a non-slip grip with indentations, well balanced, quality, and well priced.
   One can always upgrade to a Merkur Futur, Vision, or the Progress models if one wants an adjustable razor. This is my favorite one &amp; the Futur is 2nd. Happy Shaving

I had a Merkur Razor that I bought one year ago. I dropped it in the locker room at the gym and it chipped. So I kept it as a spare, but the new one (Merkur Heavy Duty Safety Razor) is the best! I should have bought this one to begin with. It makes shaving a pleasure! I enjoy shaving everyday! It helps start my day, by looking my best!!

In the world of shampoo's I must have tried
every one of them and spent much money, each
time hoping I would see the results that were
promised. Then I found this product.   My hair
responded immediately.   It is now looking
better than it has in years.   I am not a
young woman any more, but still take pride in
myself.   I have to say this is simply the best
shampoo product on the market today - bar none.

Although expensive, this product produces results while the other cheaper ones I've tried simply do not.  Every now and then I get a few zits which don't bother me really.  What bothers me is the dark spot that lasts months after the pimple is gone.  The oxygen peel drastically reduces the blotchiness and hyperpigmentation.  As soon as I rinse the stuff off my face I'm always amazed to look in the mirror and see the results.  This stuff does help keep your pores clean also.  I would recommend using this product every couple of weeks and DEFINATELY before a big event (pictures etc).  Basically you put a gel over your face and then add a hydrogen peroxide cream, the whole thing foams up, you wait 1-3 minutes (intense tingling experienced at times) and then rinse.  Some people say to 1/2 the amount recommended so the product last longer but I didn't really find it was worth it.

I have been using the Philosophy products for over a year now and it has made an amazing difference on my skin. I love this peel kit. I do admit it feels funny the first couple of times because the first layer is a jelly like substance, and then when the cream "activates" and starts foaming it takes some getting used to. BUT, it is so worth it in the end. I use it once a month and you can tell a difference with the very first use. I use the purity cleanser every day along with the hope in a jar cream. These are the best products ever. Oh and before I forget, the Falling in Love fragrence is my absolute favorite, and the Pure Grace is a very clean smell. Can you tell I am a Philosophy Girl?

This is an amazing product.  It is gentle on the skin, and I have very sensitive skin, yet removes the tired, dead, and darkening follicles.  I can't believe how much lighter and younger my skin looks after a peel.  It smells nice and doesn't cause any itching or burning, on my skin at least.  This is a must to use before big days like weddings or fabulous dates, or when getting back from a grubby camping trip.  One thing, a day after the peel my skin looks a little red/blotchy in places but the day after that it's stunning so if you are indeed purchasing this for a wedding, etc. use it 2 days before the big day or else you might look like a splotchy bride.

Most of Philosophy's products are fabulous and if you're going to go for this, it works well with the Real Purity facial cleanser to use right after the peel, and then the Hope in a Jar moisturizer after that.

This soap is awesome. What I like about it is that it doesn't have a sweet scent to it. In fact, you really have to sniff it to smell it. It leaves your hands feeling super clean and hydrated, as if you just put on a light lotion (but without the feeling of having something "on" your hands). What I do not like about this soap is that it leaves a reddish-brown film after you use it. I had to buy a special soap holder (one that has little "pillars" to hold the soap up so that it doesn't touch the surface) so it wouldn't make a mess. I really like this soap, though. It's winter, and I like anything that will keep my hands smooth and soft without having to use lotion

Exotic, enticing, and enriching all rolled into one.  As the last reviewer said, this one will have you envisioning something wild and sexy.

Too me its a mixture of so many things that it drives you absolutely WILD.  That's why I really love I love to put this 
on when I go out at night.

This scent contains a blend of: a fresh floral, including honeysuckle, gardenia and iris, with notes of amber and vanilla.

I've worn Caleche for 30 years, since a sales person in a parfumerie near the Paris opera introduced it to me in college.  It works year-round &amp; it's not heavy so you don't annoy everyone within 50 feet.  Instead, it lingers just enough.  The parfum formula is great, but this soie de parfum is perfect for work, and it's cheaper.  This is a great price from Amazon and I'm glad to see them offer it...I've had to wait till international travel to get the best buys in the duty-free stores, and it's much easier to use the web

I love the aroma of this shave cream. It may brighten your mood even if you are not in mood. It very well moisturizes and cools the skin. Overall it is an upper scale product and is worthy the price

I have naturally VERY curly and fine hair. Due to having fine hair I have the unfortunate circumstance that I do not have weight to my hair to pull the curl down, therefore I blow dry it straight every other day. For about 10 yrs now I have used the Phyto defrisant balm which is fantastic because you never feel that your hair has product in it, but it smooths it out. So I decided to buy their shampoo for similar purpose. It is excellent. It is another product that tames the hair but it moves naturally and it never feels like there is product left in the hair. Definitely a great product and paired with the defrisant balm is excellent for blow drying

I had long straight all one length hair, the kind of hair people wish they had. Then I gave birth to the love of my life and my hair went to S**T!! It went frizzy, for 8 years I tried expensive, cheap anything (so, I thought) that said would help frizzy hair. Then I heard of Phyto, Yepee!! Between PhytoBrush and Defrisant, I have my hair back. IT'S NOT FRIZZY ANYMORE. If you are anything like me, on a budget and really can't afford it. Save up. You only have to use a little to help. And the peace of mind it gives you (your sanity back)no more bad hair days. Is worth the price by far. I'll never go back. PLEASE try it. Love your hair again

I have very sensitive skin. I have tried so many face creams, if they did anything else but strictly moisturize (i.e. anti aging, etc.), my skin would break out in a rash. My daughter had given me an "anti stress" cream mask she brought from Germany.  My skin looked so much better!  One ingredient was green tea. So I searched for creams with green tea and found this one.  This cream is the answer to all those women with super sensitive skin. It actually improves my skin tone. The price is great too

I have sensitive skin and mild rosacea and have tried many so-called "calming" moisturizers, even some supposedly medically formulated ones.  This is the first moisturizer that really does seem to calm my skin, and feels soothing when applied.  Maybe it's the green tea.  It also does improve the look of my skin.  I'd be sorry if they ever discontinued this prouct - I rely on it

I tried this scent ten years ago after reading that it was Mary Tyler Moore's favorite, and it soon became mine.  Lightly feminine and sensual, it always garners compliments when I wear it.   Strangers (men and women alike) have told me how much they enjoyed the scent and asked what I was wearing.  I also carry the compressed powder compact in my purse.  It's got a slightly more "powdery" (appropriate, I suppose) note and is a wonderful way to carry the scent with you.  It will always be a staple for me

This has been one of my favorites since its introduction in 1994.  This fragrance is on the light side.  I wear it in the summer.  The undertones of this scent are definitely floral but with a good bit of spice in the background.

I love this perfume and receive compliments on it from both men and woman.  I have had people at work ask me to right down the name of this one so that they could buy it for themselves or their wife.  

This perfume is a winner.  I highly recommend this scent.  Give it a whiff the next time you are out perfume shopping. I don't think that you will be disappointed

Beyond Paradise was my Christmas gift from a dear friend and I was really surprised how well she pinpointed a perfume that is not only totally gorgeous but one that works so well with the chemistry of my skin. The fragrance is a prismatic rainbow of juicy fruits and florals, heavily laden with succulent honeysuckle and musky base. I love the lasting power of the fragrant aura that envelops me the second I pray it on and the bottle looks absolutely breathtaking on my dresser. The scent itself is heady and aromatic, more floral and sophisticated than most tropical fragrance; I don't smell bananas and coconut here but soft orchid, pulpy woods, juicy plum and soft dewy honeysuckle with its sparkling golden nectar.

This is one of my favorite perfumes now, something I reach for very often and something that puts a smile on my face whenever I get a whiff of it. One a rainy and gray monday morning I feel that I can carry a layer of ambrosial paradise that sets on me like a soft cloud of euphoric proportions as it nestles itself into my skin and exudes a shimmery cloud of scent all day long. It's really a rainbow of happiness in a bottle. 

The top notes are Eden's Mist, Blue Hyacinth, Orange Flower Templar, Jabuticaba Fruit.
Middle notes are Laelia Orchid, Crepe Jasmin, Mahonia Japonica, Pink Honeysuckle balanced over a base of Natal Plum Blossoms, Ambrette Seed, Zebrano Wood, Golden Melaleuca Bark for a sweet and fruity concoction.

I am one to always try new oils and creams that claim to be the best for nails and hands. Well let me tell you, this stuff is truly the best product that I have ever used for nails and cuticles. Solar Oil is meant for use on natural and fake nails. You should rub it on your nails and cuticles each night at bedtime. It soothes and moisturizes your nails and keeps them from being brittle and cracking. Awesome stuff...a must for anyone who wants their nails to look attractive...the price is right too

I purchased The Concentrate a year ago when I had a rhinoplasty, and put it on the incision line after the stitches came out.  Now, there isn't scar!  It is also suitable for the most sensitive skin, which I have. The Creme slightly aggrivated my skin and the Concentrate did not.  It may cost more than the Creme, but it lasts about five months when used in moderation.  I recommend it it anyone who wants scarless skin post-surgery

I purchased these at my local Sephora.  They are pretty easy to apply (much easier than I imagined) and they don't bat off like I thought they would.  I'm happy with this purchase and would purchase them again.  Wearing them to Teddy's last week I got a ton of compliments on the pink.  And for $15, you get four complete sets in white, black, pink and blue so this will last

Well I got my bottle of Curve today along with another couple of colognes on the "So you'd like to...start wearing cologne" guide on amazon that I have been purchasing by. With all my newfound knowledge about cologne history, perspective, and opinions, I used these colognes to give an informative speech this evening in my public speaking course, complete with all the bottles present. I sprayed CURVE onto myself when it arrived, and now I am comparing all of the new scents to my favorites so far, HUGO and CANDIES. My impression was that it was more serious than Hugo, had a sweetish overtone combined with musk, and then there was sort of a greenish bitter forest type scent to it that I wasn't crazy about. I think I may have been dissappointed at first, but that soon changed. After about fifteen minutes the smell got to be really good and the elements I hadn't liked were gone or had matured into subtle forms that went well together. 
After the speech I allowed the class to sample all of the colognes, and Curve was commented on the most, followed by Drakkar, then Hugo. All of the women liked it and seemed to have great associations with it, and for that I have to ensure that it gets the full 5 stars. I continue to wear it now later this same evening and it has quite grown on me. 
If you only bought Curve as your main cologne, you'd be quite alright. Subtle enough for casual wear and bright enough for clubbing. Overall good mix

This is a very popular nail polish with color names that are always a play on words or something whimsical. My favorite is "I'm Not Really A Waitress" which is a deep, diva garnet shade and really beautiful. The colors tend to be very rich or very opaque and really wear well. The bottles are pretty

I have been using this product for about 2 years now. This is a non-greasy product that is easily absorbed into your skin and keeps skin moist all day. I have struggled with very dry skin and acne all my life and this is the only product I have found that does not make me break out! Also love the fact that it has no scent whatsoever. LOVE it

I am allergic to benzoyl peroxide.  So, there are many products that I can't use for acne.  I tried everything that didn't have benzoyl peroxide in it - even expensive department store brands and beauty brands to clear up my skin.  Murad's Acne System was the only one that worked!  My skin cleared up in a week.  I didn't go through any purging that I could tell.  However, I started using the system right after a professional deep cleansing facial.  It took several months to get completely clear but it worked.  I have been using it for several years now and break out if I forget it when I'm travelling.  I can't live without it!  I recently got a facial on a cruise and the woman couldn't believe that I had problems with breakouts.  I would if I wasn't using my Murad.

I faithfully wash my face in the shower with the cleansing gel every morning.  Once or twice a week I use the AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser that I purchased separately.  I then apply the Acne Treatment Gel after I've dried off.  I follow with the moisturizer in the kit.  I do the same thing at night (except I'm not in the shower).  I almost never need the spot treatment now.  I have several tubes drying up in my cabinet.  I bought the mask separately too and used it a lot in the beginning but now I think the tube has dried up.  I haven't needed it in over a year.  I also used the vitamin supplements in the beginning.  However, since I do take vitamins anyway, I didn't really notice that they made a difference.  I also get a facial by a professional once and awhile to give my skin a boost.  However, since they are $$$ I tend to only get 2 or 3 a year.  Last year I only had one and my skin looked great.

Mistral, as many know, is a powerful, gusty wind that blows across the south of France. Mistral, as I was happy to discover, is also the name of a line of bath and body products, all French inspired, all lusciously lovely from scented soaps to soothing lotions to rejuvenating body butters. 

Matthew Tilker, founder and president of Mistral, utilizes Shea butter, which is an efficacious natural healer, in a myriad of must-have forms. Derived from the nuts of the African Shea Tree (according to sacred custom the nuts are harvested primarily by women), this butter is highly emollient, a boon for those with dry skin, chapped lips, any number of skin irritations. 

The pure Shea Butter soap comes in a plethora of inviting fragrances, all milled six times (while others boast being triple milled). South Seas is a particular favorite - it's as fresh as an ocean breeze and as calming, soothing as a tropical island. The marine scent is accented with a touch of grapefruit, white flowers and soft woods. An irresistible combination. 

South Seas is a fragrance with which you wish to surround yourself - made possible by the shower gel, body lotion, massage bath and body oil, bath salts and candle all available at very accessible prices.

Buffy makes me so happy, I hate to shower without it.  I have extremely dry and sensitive skin and I'm prone to icky scaly patches, especially in winter.  Buffy smooths them away with the scrubby bits, then moisturizes with the butters and oils.  It's worth the money -- even with regular use, the bar lasts a long time.

My favorite thing about Buffy... it's awesome exfoliating properties!  I live in Hawaii, and the salt water and sun can take a beating to your skin, so I love this product!  It does an awesome job of exfoliating away dead and dry skin, and the essential oils in the bar give my skin it's moisture back.  Though like mentioned in other reviews, the almond pieces may be too rough for sensitive skin, and I wouldn't recommend this for daily use for anyone who has oily skin.  Once a week should be great.

The only thing I didn't care was the fact that Buffy did leave a slight coat of oil on my skin, and unless I was taking a really hot shower, my shower/tub floor was left feeling slick also.  I usually have to rinse again quickly with my soap, but this bar is a really nice skin conditioner for once-a-week treatments. I like to save the bar and use it when I have some time to relax for a while in the tub.  That way I'll do the bar right when I get in, and just let the essential oils absorb into my skin. I love it!

Still highly recommended

Buffy is my favorite Lush product ... and I know I'm not alone in this! Anything that saves me steps in the morning is a wonderful thing, and I love the idea that it's exfoliating and moisturizing in one. It's actually really difficult to describe the Buffy experience, but if you try this one, I'm sure you'll be hooked like me. The scent is yummy and unlike previous reviewers, I find that it lasts for a long time (although like all Lush products, you don't want to leave them sitting in the shower or tub - let them dry out after each use). I use Buffy on my legs in between shaving days, and I do an all over body scrub about once every week or two. Doing this, the small bar lasts about a month. I love that it's such a strong exfoliator, but someone with sensitive skin may need to go easy with Buffy

Okay, so I'm a lotions and potions person. And, I suffer from severe dry skin. You know, the dry bumps all over your arms, and itchy patches on legs sort of dryness. A dermatologist called it extreme keratosis pilaris, and told me to use something like Amlactin. 
So I used that stuff and it worked, but the smell and texture was dreadful. So over the years I've tested and tried multiple other things. And it's worked, but all left my skin kinda sticky, and not moisturized enough.

Then,.....I found this little miracle bar. It took care of all my skin issues, plus it felt good, plus is smelled good. And I have wonderful skin! AND (big and, because I have 2 small kids and no time)it eliminated 1 step from my shower routine (the lotion step). Seriously, you don't need lotion after this, as a matter of fact, worst case, I can go 2 days without moisturizing (2 small kids, lack of time again), and my skin still feels great.

I love, love, love this stuff

I get complimented by dates for having soft skin and this is the secret. I combine it w/ Nivea Q10 lotion, which is non-greasy and the combination leaves my skin ultra-soft. 

A tip in using this is to cut it up into little squares before you use it. Each little square will be 1-2 uses. If you get the biggest size, you should cut it into slabs first, then make squares out of those. It's expensive, but it'll last for quite a while if you do this

I bought this for my girlfriend.  She had told me about it after Christmas, when she smelled it from a strip in a magazine.  I told her I would get it for her.  I had purchased the larger, 100 ml, and she absolutely loves it.  She has been showered many times with gifts and this was a special one.  I was not going to let her down.  It's not the gift but the love behind it that counts

I've been eyeing this on the fantasybritneyspears.com website &amp; counting down the days until my holiday to New York - the fact that it's Britney made me wanted it!

Was I disappointed after my wait? Not at all, I bought the 100ml bottle.

I admit I was a little wary - I suffer from migraines so can't wear a lot of my favourites; including Angel by Thierry Mugler. Not so with FANTASY. 

This opens with the sweetness of chocolate and cupcake, before settling with fruity scents of lychee, quince and kiwi. The base note of vanilla lingers throughout making FANTASY a truly delicious classic in the making - Angel light!!

I loved the presentation in a little black bag with a red string. When you open the silver tin, there's an almond on top of the body butter (which I didn't dare to eat). I love the smell of this product and that's why I gave this 4 stars! The only thing is that it's too greasy for my taste. I can't open doors afterwards or pull a cap off of my chapstick.

If you enjoy a strong, fresh scent, then Demon is for you...this is one of my favorite soaps by Lush and a repeat buy.  It is fun to look at, smell, and use in the shower or bath and it does what I have come to expect from Lush products- it makes getting clean a lot more fun!  This soap is not just for men, but for women, too!  I also love the way the ingredients in these soaps make my skin feel after the shower...

A word of advice: Lush soaps may foam very little in certain types of water...in this case I recommend a bath puff or some other type of sponge to work up a nice lather

I love this soap, it smells great and makes my skin soft. 
I only peeled off the wax on one side (I didn't find it difficult), and I set the soap up on its waxed side, preventing it from melting. I haven't had any problems with using it like this!
The smell is really refreshing. I do wish it stayed around longer after the shower though.
My one major complaint is that it dosn't lather that well

I really like the minty scent of this soap. I think it is best for a guy because it is not very "girly." The soap itself looks great as a decorative guest bathroom soap. 

Despite what others say it says right on the soaps label to "remove black wax before use" I had no problem at all removing it. It was 90 degrees (F) out the day I got the soap so it was kinda soft. After it hardned up a bit the black wax came right off with no problem. I only give it four stars though because the black wax thing is kinda goofy. As much as I get the point of "demon in the dark" the wax goes right in the trash when you get it. I would rather just buy the soap with out the wax on

I bought this for my husband to use after his 4am runs, thinking the mint might start his day off happy and awake.  He loves the smell (and the color).  The nice lady who sold it to us told us to take the wax off, so we didnt have an issue with that.  I used it one morning after I was crazy enough to get up and exercise at 4am and I liked it too.  The scent isnt too strong for girls, and it took all the oily feeling from my post-exercise skin without drying me out

*****
This has been my daily moisturizer for several years. It makes my skin very soft, very healthy looking, and glowing. It makes me look radiant. I have given it as a gift to my sister and to other women, and they have all liked it as much as I have. No one has had any adverse reactions. You can notice a difference after just one use. When I've run out and used something else temporarily, I always can see the difference again once I start back up. It is as close as it gets to a miracle cream.

I do not wear makeup, so Hope In A Jar is it.  I am 49 years old and I think my skin looks incredible.  The friends I have given it to also like to keep a natural look and prefer their skin without heavy creams, thick moisturizers and sunscreens, or makeup. 

The women I know who are fans of Hope In A Jar are like me. We're kind of lazy no-fuss "one cream that does it all" people; instead of one jar of something for one thing, and another for something else---eye creams, night time moisturizers, daytime moisturizers, etc.---we're the type that wants just one that can do the job and then be done with it. In other words, we don't have the patience to fuss with our looks a lot, or to spend money buying bunches of different creams to keep track of and remember to use.

Unlike other reviewers, I love the smell, which is not perfumey, but definitely pleasantly distinctive. I use it around my eyes also, and have not had an allergic reaction.  It seems, though, that these are the two biggest problems with Hope---the distinctive odor and allergic reactions among some people.  I would suggest buying it the first time from somewhere you could return it if you don't care for it; although in my opinion, this would be unlikely, apparently it is possible. Philosophy now makes another version of Hope In A Jar for sensitive skin; if you know that your skin in tempermental, perhaps it would be better to also try this version. I have stuck with Hope In A Jar because it works so well for me. 

It seems expensive, but it is not because it lasts a long, long time.  The two-ounce jar lasts me about six months.  I use a toner and then Hope In A Jar and that's it.  I'm done with my face in 30 seconds. Plus, it gives me a look that most women use makeup to get, so I think it's a bargain.

As a reviewer in my mid-forties, I have gone through many brands of moisturizer in the last few years looking for something that worked well for my "normal" but sometimes stressed skin.  After spending a small fortune on skincare products, I have finally found a product I can count on.  Hope in a Jar leaves my skin with a clean yet moisturized feeling, and is a perfect base for foundation, as it is not greasy or oily.  And, as an added bonus, the price seems reasonable for something that lasts so long.  It is necessary to use a good eye cream as well, as this product is not meant for the eye area, and can be slightly irritating.  Overall, I have seen a marked improvement in my skin in the last 3 months since using this product

I admit I have not used a ton of different types of cologne, but out of all of them, Fahrenheit is the greatest. I purchased a small bottle of this stuff about 4 or 5 years ago. I still have some left, I just can't bring myself to finish it off, I think I might have 20 or so sprays left.

Sure it is masculine, but it is not by any means musky. It has a somewhat sweeter scent than average, when it comes to stuff like this geared for a dude. It just smells awesome and thats what counts

~These really fill out your lips, and give them good color and shine. But you have to constantly put it on, if you are on a dinner date type thing or just eating and drinking, then I wouldnt recomend it. Dancing or just hanging out, it's perfect for it

These glosses are so beautiful. They coat in the most lucious way and another plus is they don't leave you feeling like you have tar on your lips. Another thing is the colors don't look artificial. So many times does a gloss make you look like a clown if you pick the wrong color. However this just looks awesome. It stays with you for a while too. The only thumbs down is on the taste factor. I expect glosses to be flavorful and these aren't. But with all the grandeur of the product, I can't give it less than 5 stars. A note to buyers: the colors on here aren't the actual colors. Like Sun Bronze is a lot lighter and glistens. Miracle also is a pale shade of sparkling pink. On the bright side every color looks good on everyone so buy buy buy! A little pricy but worth it compared to how long it lasts compared to all the other duds out there.

I just discovered this 3 weeks ago. A woman with perfect skin told me when she first tried it she saw a huge difference. I didn't like the way my skin looked for the first couple days. It felt a little greasy and heavy (and kind of has a bacon grease type scent) but I stuck to it and am now getting compliments on my radiance!
Though that might be partly due to my yoga program!
I like that this helps protect the skin from sun. I use it under skinceuticals spf 20 which I love also

This smells so good. I love the Philosophy line and my favorites are Cinnamon Buns, EggNog and blackberry. Dont use this if you are in a hurry, becuz you will want to linger as long as you can in the shower! The only downfall is the scent does not last for more then a few mins on your skin, but lasts awhile engulfing your bathroom in a yummy cinnamon buns scent

I keep coming back to this one; lovely fragrance, very fresh, but not girly in my opinion.  Never gets old, and you don't smell it on a lot of people.  Ralph Lauren knows his stuff, fragrance-wise.

I have a habit of stopping by perfume counters way too often, and have a fair collection to show for it. However, about a year and a half ago I came across Blue. I had done my usual trick of not wearing any perfume to the mall, then stopping by to sample a scent or two, then wander around to do my shopping..this way I can tell what the scent is like on me after a bit of time. Blue had me hooked immediately. It has now become my absolute scent of choice...I have had complete strangers, both men and women literally stop me in the grocery store, at the mall, at work, EVERYWHERE just to ask me what I am wearing. It is light, not overpowering...I am not a fan of the heavy florals, and so this is ideal for me. I personally love it, but the staggering amount of compliments from friends and total strangers alike has confirmed that this perfume is beautiful, light, elegant and fresh, and yet most definitely makes a statement.  I cannot recommend this highly enough...just try it on for the day the next time you go to a department store. I can virtually guarantee  that you will head back to pick some up...it is truly that lovely

This scent is amazing! Ralph Blue has a floral scent, it smells like a exotic bouquet of flowers. It is sexy and fun. I think people of all ages will enjoy this scent. What is neat about this fragrance is that this is a scent that uses surface area, moisture and body heat to achieve its maximum bloom! so all of these factors considered, this scent is going to vary from person to person, so no two are going to smell exactly alike :) Also the blue bottle is gorgeous!

Great for moisturizing dry and rough skin. I live in a humid area, so it's important for me not to have to put a heavy lotion or cream on my skin. This lotion leaves my face feeling good, and not greasy or slimy at all.

This product works wonders over the winter months.  I didn't realize how it prevents dry skin until after I stopped using it for a few days during the winter.  From my experience, this product doesn't leave an oily film on your face or make you shine for hours under the lights.  Unlike other products, I don't feel like a teenager going thru acne again.

The price for the quality is worth it and the amount you need to apply makes the cost per application comparable to other products

This is an amazing product. It is probably the lightest product I have used, providing a lot of moisture but basically leaving no residue and just a soft, matte feel. This line makes really advanced skincare products and the ingredients on this product such as hyluronic acid and alpha/beta hydroxy acids are usually only found on the best skincare lines. I really like the fact that the product has no added fragance and comes in a generous 6oz bottle, when most of the other men's moisturizers come in 2-2.5 oz containers. I will definitively try other products of this line

I love this stuff!  Too bad it is so PRICEY (for my pocketbook, anyways).  I have long, fine hair that TANGLES so easily.  This stuff works magic on it.  Changes the texture of it to soft.  You dont need to use that much of it--a dimes worth, so even if it is expensive, you know its gonna last you a long time.  Def worth it

I have long, straight hair. I am not really big on using hair products, but I use just a half- dime size of this stuff. I love it because it is light (it is like i didnt add anything extra to my hair), leaves my hair very silky soft, helps control some of that extra static, and smells great! :) 
The bottle lasts a pretty long time- I have had mine for over a year now and it a small size.

My son had some baby acne and his face was a little dry.  They said not use soap on his face and I didn't think it ever felt as clean as I wanted it to.  So I tried this and the Mustela Bebe face lotion and the acne cleared and his face is nice an soft now.  It has a nice scent as well, not the usual baby scent that everyone knows and loves though.  But is still nice

I am thrilled with this product, which is great for diaper changes and wipe ups (face, nose area, hands).  It truly requires no rinsing and has been wonderful when used on both my sensitive skin daughters aged 2 and 10 months. We have never experienced a negative reaction to this product and its light, clean scent is divine.

I love this stuff!  The pink on the high of the cheek bone really lifts your whole face and the darker line beneath, gave my face a fantastic elegant look. A definite for that red carpet feel, although I wear it everyday.  No-one can quite work out why I look so good, I'm sure everyone thinks I've had botox....

LUSH continues to amaze with each and every item I try lately. This Fair Trade Foot Lotion works perfectly as a daily foot lotion or is perfect in combination with the Volcano Foot mask for occasional pampering. 

Almond oil, cocoa butter, spearmint, peppermint and Tagetes Minuta flower oil blend perfectly together in this delicately pink lotion. The results are pretty impressive and the moisturizing benefits last overnight. The lotion soothes and moisturizes and leaves your feet with a little pepperminty tingle. I'll be using this a lot in the summer! 

Quite possibly my favorite foot lotion find! If love this, you will totally fall for "Smitten."

It feels all tingly and cold on my feet. Perfect after a hard day of walking or shopping. It's perfect for people who are on there feet all day likes sales associates and moms too who are chasing kids all over the place all day long. This is one of my favorite products. It also helped my rough callouses to become smoother. Highly recommended

This cream is loaded with cocoa butter (obtained by Fair Trade) and scented with spearmint, my favorite mint. It is soothing and cooling. It is nice rubbed all the way from foot to knee and really works well. The scent is strong--LOTS of SPEARMINT. That's the best part of it, as this is cooling for the feet and keeps them smelling clean and nice long after you bathe

I honestly thought I was going to have to give this one a lower star rating. Upon receiving this item in the mail, I dove right in. The one drawback that immediately hit me was the smell. It basically smells like mint toothpaste. I knew it was going to be minty, just not quite so minty. So I smoothed some on and rubbed it up to my ankles. The sensation was very cool and I was surprised how oily and slippery my feet were. I'm used to most feet creams sinking in and kind of dissapearing. 

So, my initial thought was pleasant, but kind of wierd. Now I have to say though, that as a soother and moisterizer it works great. My feet are are very soft and it works at the rough parts of me feet very well. I'm excited to try this with an exfoliater of some sort. 

I took away one start for the toothpaste smell, but really this is an awesome product. In the summer I'll probably keep this stuff in the fridge. I imagine it would feel great when really really cold after a long day of work

I have been using Fair Trade Foot Lotion for about a week now and have really noticed a difference.  I live in Hawaii and constantly wear slippers (flip flops, thongs, etc.) so my feet are exposed to the elements 24/7.  

For the past several months, I have been having very sore feet (aches when I walk on them).  I have since discovered LUSH's Fair Trade Foot Lotion and their foot mask Volcano (see my review).  Even though I just started using the lotion, with continued use of both, I have noticed a decrease in soreness and my feet look WONDERFUL!  I've always had cracked, scaly, callus feet, but not anymore.

I would get pedicures just to help with the appearance of my feet, but I haven't gotten one in months now!  Fair Trade Foot Lotion absorbs quickly as long as you don't use too much and makes your feet feel so refreshing.  I just put a little on at night and my feet are good to go the next morning!

Definitely give this one a try

       If you're a scandal in your sandals due to winter neglect better hot foot it out and buy some Fair Trade Foot Lotion.  Pedicures are wonderful but somehow the effect is lost if the season's hottest color is applied to toes topping rough, unsightly feet.  

	Fair Trade is every bit as pretty as your tootsies will soon be - it's pink and pepperminty.  However, we wise ones know you can't tell a lotion by its color.  The ultimate sole salve, Fair Trade moisturizes with cocoa butter, almond oil, glycerine and lanolin.   Plus, spearmint and peppermint are circulation aides with antifungal properties.  (Foot fungus is a definite turn-off, even if he has a foot fetish).

	Now, after a week or two you'll know the true meaning of sole support, arch support, and fabulous feet.  Why, your now elegant extremities may even put those new Jimmy Choo's to shame.

My husband and I take a pot of then when we go on holiday, and after a long day of walking around, we come home with sore feet and massage each other's with Fair Trade until we feel that we can stand up again. It's brilliant stuff, and probably the only way we've made it back out of the hotel for dinner some nights

After years of searching I've finally found the perfect perfume. Pink Sugar makes me feel fabulous when I wear it; it's so light and `warm' with a base of sensual vanilla. I have the large bottle, body mousse &amp; deodorent at home, and the smaller bottle in my handbag. I don't get bored with this fragrence, like I do with everything else I've tried over the years.

The first time I wore Pink Sugar to work one colleague commented on the aroma of drinking chocolate as I was in the lift with her. The next time I was in the lift, everyone commented on my lovely vanilla perfume. After I applied a freshen up spray, another colleague said she could smell cakes! Yet another colleague demanded to know what I was wearing, and where she could get some. Strangers come up to me in the street to ask what scent I'm wearing...

No this isn't a cheesy ad, it really happened!! 


What do I sense first? Liquorice, a rich aniseed scent that gradually settles into a middle note of caramel. Marshmallow is the first word that springs to mind to me. 

If you like Angel, Fantasy or Princess you need to give this a try!



 *Aquolina needs to make Pink Sugar available to the U.K. - Postage and packing costs a fortune!!!

        Yep, this is an eye shadow, but one with a WOW factor.  It's a fine silky powder that applies easily (with Laura's Wet/Dry Definition Brush) and stays from  crow of the rooster to  coach turning into a pumpkin.

	The Mineral Eye Powders collection comes in six shades ranging from a soft almost nude to a midnight hue with blues and greens in between.  My current favorites are "Milky Way" - a moonlit sheen and "Eclipse."	

	When used dry these powders deliver a subtle shimmer all over  the eye; wet is your choice for added definition or to be used as a liner.

	Love the packaging - a small pot with an opening for brush and a snap lid - no mess no fuss, only great looking eyes!

Think of it as loose eye shadow and eyeliner . . . with a kick. Laura Mercier Mineral Eye Powders are so incredibly versatile and can be applied wet or dry, as shadow or as liner, that it's possible to create endless different looks that range from casual and pretty to stunning and dramatic. Choosing to apply wet or dry will not only change to application but will give you beautifully different textures and definitions and degrees of sparkle.  

Using the mineral eye powder wet will make the color and look more intense and defined but will give it less sparkle. You'll also get an increase in the wear and the added option of using the powder as a liner. Using the powders dry will give them the most sparkle punch.

Laura Mercier Mineral Eye Powders come in six different shades -- two light colors: Milky Way &amp; Galaxy and two intense colors: Meteor, Eclipse, Constellation, &amp; Asteroid.

All Laura Mercier eye products are ophthalmologist and dermatologist tested.


Color Notes:

Milky Way - a very light, barely pink, opalescent color that will not only add silver toned sparkle but will lighten the feature or eye shadow color on which it is applied. Choose this color if you want to highlight and lighten.
 
Galaxy - a very light, barely grey-taupe color that will add gold tone sparkle but will otherwise blend into all but the darkest skin colors. Choose this color if you want the starstruck look but don't otherwise want to change your eye shadow color. This color will also work well on other areas of the face. Try putting just a dab in the inside corner of each eye for a real, yet subtle, eye pop.

Meteor - an intense color of green in the forest family with silver toned sparkle. Makes the most amazing eye liner color. 

Eclipse - an intense color of black with silver sheen. Makes a classic looking eyeliner color but with the updated twist of star struck sparkle.

Constellation - an intense color of purple that's similar to Laura's famous Black Violet Kohl Pencil. The sparkle on this one is gold tone. Women with green or hazel eyes will love how Constellation makes their eye color really pop. 

Asteroid - An intense color of dark blue with silver sheen. Makes a beautiful eye liner for brown and blue eyes and will help remove redness from the eyes of any shade. 


Basic "how to use" tips:
    * To line the eyes: dampen Wet/Dry Definer Brush with water, dip into one of the four darker shades, and mix to desired consistency. I like to use the back of my hand as a `palette' to mix the powder. To increase the shimmer, apply more powder on top of the eyeliner but this time use the brush dry. To further lengthen the wear of the powder as a liner, first line the eyes with one of Laura's Kohl Eye Pencils and then apply the powder on top.  This will also give your liner extra sheen.
    * To use as eye color: dampen Wet/Dry Definer Brush with water, dip into a darker shade and mix to desired consistency, once again using the back of the hand. Apply to eyelid and blend color with Ponytail Brush or apply directly to the eyelid with the dry brush- using wet leaves a sheen finish, using dry leaves a sparkly finish.

Fun "how to use" tips:
-Try Meteor as a shadow, lined with the Eclipse, and smudge Constellation all around for that smokey smudgy look.
-Cover your entire eyelid with Milky Way and line with Asteroid.
-Put dots of Galaxy in the inside corners of your eyes and just apply mascara

For a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is MAC. Lipglass feels good on your lips, as if it contained some emollients. And (this is a big AND) it's not tacky or sticky. 

The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. 

Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. 

Enjoy!

I'm REALLY anal about scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored with vanilla, but MAC LipGlass isn't that vanilla-ish at all!  It's got very pigmented color, it stays on a LONG time for a gloss, and each tube lasts a long time...  Don't let what the other reviewer said about the vanilla scent throw you off

As a cosmetologist this tool is amazing! If you don't know how to use it, I could see how it would be frustrating. It works wonderfully and does not abrade or damage the dermal layer like using your fingers. It's a great way to remove comedones in a sterile and effective way

Too bad the scent doesn't last very long. After a couple of hours, a re-touch is neccessary. That's my only pet-peeve, but no star is deducted. This is not a perfume and I don't expect the scent to be long-lasting. I think this fragrance is great for everyday use. If cK One complements with your body chemistry, then don't hesitate to buy it

This is a nice, light daytime fragrance that's pleasant to wear on weekends and other casual times. (For evenings, nothing comes between me and my Must de Cartier!) It's citrusy but has a little more depth and balance to it so you don't go around smelling like the fruit stand at the store.  This was the first unisex fragrance I ever tried and I was surprised that I liked it, though it's a bit "soft" for my husband's taste so I'll never get him to try it. That's probably for the better, I'd hate to start sharing fragrances with him.

This was the first gift my then boyfriend now fiancee, ever gave to me. That was over 4 years ago, and I still love the scent. Especially since it's not too strong for casual every day wear, but noticeable enough to get compliments.

So I read all the reviews here before purchasing it and decided I'd give it a go due to all the good feedback...And I'm so glad I did! I've been a regular Lancome mascara user for awhile- started with Definicils, went to L'Extreme, but this is what I'm sticking with.  My lashes look loooong...and that's saying a lot because I have some pretty puny lashes.  Not only does it lengthen, but it seperates and thickens.  I also bought the Cils Booster (I think that's what it's called - it's the Lancome mascara primer) and my lashes just pop.  Great product

I first purchased Hypnose for my wedding last summer and I absolutely loved it!  I should be a spokesperson for Lancome because I refer this product to everyone when they talk about my beautiful, thick lashes.  I recently went into Bath and Body shop and a saleswoman was trying to get me to buy their mascara.  That day I didnt have any on, so I told her that I already had a product that would make her go shop at Lancome.  I told her to stand on the side of me while I applied it.  She was in shock.  "Oh my gosh-Look at how your lashes just grew!  She had me stop while she grabbed another store clerk and a customer.  She went on break and we walked to the Lancome counter and she bought some right then!

My only problem with this mascara is that it is so thick, you must use a creamy makeup remover to get it off.  Using a liquid will just frustrate you because it will do nothing.  Also, never accidentally fall asleep with it on because it will be there in the morning! It lasts through tears, sweat and even the pool.  Truly a wonderful produc

I am a 19 year old Cosmetology student, so trust me, I've tried out probably 100 different mascaras in the past 2 years. Lancome's Hypnose is my absolute favorite, hands down the best all-around mascara. It does it all for your lashes. It really brightens your eyes, and brings out your beauty :). It is especially good if you are looking for a thickening mascara

I've only used this twice so far (last night and this morning) but already I've noticed my skin is not as oily and it's really soft after I rinse it off.  I'm intrigued by the entire Lush product line - glad I stumbled upon this.  I've got some samples on the way (won off an auction site) and I can't wait to try them.  Also, this seller was awesome when UPS for some reason thought I moved.  When I called Lush a live person answered the phone and called UPS for me.  UPS called me within 30 minutes and offered to bring it out that night.  Wonderful!!  My skin is oily with lg pores and blackheads - go ahead and give this a try if this sounds like your skin.  The only drawback is it's a little on the messy side but not too bad

Works great for combination skin!
Herbalism is meant for oily skin; however I find it perfect for my combination skin.  It never leaves my skin dry or patchy, and throughout the day my skin has a nice matte look, thanks to the rice bran in the cleanser.  

I tried this as a sample and although it worked really well, I didn't care for the strong herbal scent of Herbalism and I didn't like the rose petals in the cleanser because they `got in the way' or just fell in the sink as I cleansed.  I prefer a cleanser with a more uniform consistency (like LUSH's Angels on Bare Skin; see my review), so I only buy Herbalism in small quantities (less than $5 amounts) and use it when my face is really feeling oily.  Other wise I use LUSH's Ocean Salt or Angels on Bare Skin as my nightly cleanser.

Still an overall great product!

I have oily asian skin and I have tried the other lush facial cleansers (fresh farmacy, angels on bare skin, and aquamarina) and this is the one that has greatly improved the quality of my facial skin. I use it once a day after coming from work and before going to bed. It has just taken care of my skin. I've had late nights, stressful times, lack of sleep, sometimes I haven't been able to wash my face at all. To top it off, I'm a smoker. Since using this product, I've gone through those and I've only gotten 3 pimples. When that happens to me, my face is usually peppered with blackheads and pimples. Herbalism has really taken care of my facial skin. This stuff is exquisite and a keeper

I dont know what they put in it, I just know that it works. Within three days of getting this product from the Chicago LUSH store, my face had cleared up beautifuly.

I've had really awful skin, blackheads, whiteheads, deep cystic acne, since I was around 14, and I've tried anything I could get my hands on to take care of it (Proactive, and everything else)   I had a problem finding a product that would clean up my super oily skin without irritating it because its very very sensitive. This did the trick beautifuly (and followed up with some Celestial mosturizer after some hardcore exfoliation) Made my face feel very soft and smooth after washing instead of all itchy and flakey.  My pores also looked noticably smaller as well.

Plus it smells great

I have combination skin prone to little breakouts. Since using this, my skin feels far more balanced, and I've kissed my breakouts goodbye. 
The product is a fairly thick paste which smells green and fresh and sort of pine-y. I find the best way to use it is to dampen my face, put a little lump (dime-size) on my fingertips and rub it all over like I was washing with a teeny tiny bar of soap. :) It exfoliates really gently and when I rinse off I find I have smooth soft skin that is already moisturized, neither oily nor dry. I use it daily and love it, love it, love it

The "Creamy Candy Bath Melt" is what turned me on to LUSH in the first place. In addition to vanilla, I absolutely adore sweet candy-type fragrances and this is no exception. The melt moisturizes your skin without leaving it feeling greasy and the smell is yummilicious! I try to order multiples of these at a time so that they are always on hand since I never know when the mood to use one will strike me (I'd use them just about all of the time if I could).

If you like super sweet and girlie, then go for it and try Creamy Candy! :

This is a super-rich bath for those with very dry skin. The melt is basically oils, a luscious scent, and some soaping or foaming agents to make the oils disperse into the bathwater and not float on top like they would otherwise. It can sometimes be a little too rich for my skin, but I love the scent so I use it occasionally anyway and just rinse off afterwards with some Rock Star soap.

The scent is the lovely Rock Star scent, a vanilla-y candy scent that kids also love.

I tend to be beauty-frugal, so I tend to expect a modern-day miracle when I spend more than 25 dollars on a beauty product.  
I really like this moisturizer, which feels good and gives my skin a nice, supple feeling for not-too-much product.  

However, no miracle, just a nice skin cream

I love this day cream. It smells great and hydrates beautifully without looking greasy. The only downfall is that it doesn't have SPF, so you have to apply additional sunscreen over it. As for its treatment qualities, I do think it made my skin somewhat more radiant and smoother, and it didn't make me break out. It's a great product for the price

I disagree with the negative reviews. These wipes are the softest and softer than the Kirkland wipes. My husband couldn't use the pamper wipes since they would cause sever redness on my 1st born's butt area. It was raw. Once we switched to Mustela, no matter how hard my husband wipes, our baby's skin is still nice and soft. We have used this since our 1st born and we are on our third. The smell is nice and not powerfull. I love the wipes

This is quite a good shampoo for fine hair.  I did get a lot of volume, but it also made my hair feel a bit dry at the ends.  I've found LUSH's Big shampoo to give me the volume and it makes my hair feel healthy and silky as well.  This is still good, but not quite as good

This stuff is costly but a little of it goes a long way. The texture of this is perfect. It's creamy but not overly moist. It sets nicely and has a natural dewy finish with a medium coverage. It never looks cakey or overly done like other medium formulations. I can use a dallop the size of a quarter for almost a week. At that rate I think a bottle should last a very long time. Its also the only brand that perfectly matches my very fair skin (of course how it matches you depends entirely on you!)

While in Sephora looking for a new Nars lipstick, a pretty Dior rep approached me.  I would have normally declined her offer of a mini-make-over, but I was feeling rather adventurous and wanted to update some of my make-up items, so I followed her to her chair where she went to work on me.  

I have to say, in the past, I have been nonplussed and unimpressed with makeovers like these.  But when the rep handed me the mirror, I gasped.  Even under the harsh lighting, my complexion looked pretty darn flawless for a youthful grandmother trying to hold on to any vestige of good looks.  

I bought the foundation, along with the finishing powder and a few other Dior goodies.  I figured I would probably use it a few times and realize it didn't really look as good on me at home or in the office as it did when the Dior rep did my makeup in the store.  Then I would experience buyer's remorse and continue my quest for the perfect foundation. 

Lucky for me, I was wrong.  This product has become one of my top choices for foundation.  It doesn't settle in the fine lines around my eyes, or in my pores.  Instead, it does what it says -- smooths out my complexion. The color chosen for me looks natural with no lines of demarcation. And the coverage is what I prefer at this stage in my life.  

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I am still searching for this type of lush coverage that gives my combo skin less shine by mid-day.  But for now, I will finish using the bottle, and probably purchase another, which is something I haven't done with other foundations in some time.  

My biggest tip with this foundation is a little goes a long way.  The Dior rep used a make-up brush and that tends to give more of a sheer, even coverage.  At $50, it wouldn't seem to be a bargain, but if you use it as I've described, it should last you several months.

I am 42 years old. This is the best makeup I have ever used. It is a bit more expensive than most but worth every penny! I have always used a top quality makeup. I have tried others and never found one good enough to switch till now.

This foundation is worth every penny.  It DOES make your face feel firmer and look younger on the first use. Don't ask me how it works, I don't know, but the tiny lines around my eyes disappeared.  ALSO, it holds up against heat, sweat, tears.  It doesn't rub off on your clothes, either.  The only way I'll ever leave this foundation is if Dior themselves come up with a new improved formula, which I can't see happening.  Try it at the counter, walk around a look at yourself in the mirror.  You'll say, "WOW, Amazing!" TOO

Walking through airport security just last week, I was stopped by a TSA employee who asked "Who's wearing cologne?!"

I said "Not me!" before realizing that I WAS wearing some karma kream. I said so, and she asked where I'd gotten it. Phew! I was thinking someone had allergies or something and I was one of those people who was wearing too much perfume/lotion/whatever, oblivious to the fact that everyone around them was holding their nose. But she was actually really curious, and followed me past security so she could get the name of the store (Lush!) that sells this great stuff. 

Seriously, it's great! I've never in my life had anyone remark on any perfume or scented lotion I was wearing until I found karma kream, which I received as a sample in a recent order of Lush goodies. Now strangers, relatives, and friends are all asking me where they can get some of this stuff. 

The karma scent is really, really great - citrusy, with a tiny hint of lavendar, pine, and patchouli. You won't smell like a dirty hippie, though, trust me. The patchouli and pine are just bass notes to the main players - orange flower water, citrus, and lavendar scents. So fresh! It's great. Really wakes me up in the morning, and refreshes me during the day if I put some on.

This lotion won't leave your skin feeling greasy, either, like so many moisturizers can. My skin is really thanking me for discovering Lush products. If you want a subtle perfume but don't want something as strong as a concentrated perfume, this lotion is great, and as an added benefit, it will moisturize your skin while you're wearing it! And if you want a light perfume, you can put some karma kream on your neck, arms, or legs to have just a hint of scent.

      Karma might be loosely described as destiny.  It's a  fate that  occurs as  an effect following a cause.  Okay, since we may have some control, what would you like to bring about? (Let's save the arrival of Prince Charming for another time).  If you'd like the effect to be beautiful, soft, touchable, kissable, skin, just smooth on Karma Kream.

	One other effect caused by Karma Kream is a delightful lingering fragrance.  Those nearing  the nape of your neck with notions  of nuzzling  may not be able to identify the subtle bouquet - they'll only know it's irresistible, this blend of Orange Flower Water, Lavender Oil, Lemongrass, Patchouli and other good scents.

	It's said that more people in the world believe in karma than do not.  Hmmmmm, don't know about that.  But, I do know that all of us want good karma and that's  Karma Kream.

	There now, apply Karma Kream before bedtime and rest well secure in the knowledge that your skin will be softer in the morning, and some day your Prince will come.

I love patchouli. Unfortunately, it is very hard to find in pure form.  Often it is mixed with other perfume scents.  The Body Shop offers wonderful products and this perfume oil is no exception. I only hope that they continue offering this scent.  Try it, you won't be disappointed

Although most every fitness magazine I read has at least 2 articles about "Health and Beauty/Grooming", I'm still pretty certain that we're, Most Men in General, still in the woods in regard to proper skin care. The times are changing, more rapidly than ever before, and the need for separating the good, the bad and the ugly is HERE!

I'm a fairly active 37 year old male with fairly nice skin, although my Italian heritage prediposes my olive skin to being much oilier than I'd like. I have small areas of "Combination Skin", in addition to my generally oily skin type, which has often been more difficult to manage than anything else. Gone are the days of Vaseline and generic cleansers and moisturizers. Welcome are the days of skin products designed for treat and maintain almost any possible skin type. 

My review is submitted, as I, too, had no idea that "Philosophy" was anything other than one of the hardest classes I ever surived through in College! When I told my close friend, an aspiring and very beautiful female model and actress, that she REALLY had a youthful glow and joked about her having "Some cosmetic work done!", she accepted it quite well and with a big southern smile. She told me that it wasn't plastic surgery and it wasn't any high-tech laser procedure or over-priced exfolliant scrub. Instead, she said she was on the run and would stop by to visit with myself and my spouse after dinner.

Karin came over with a bag full of goodies, everything from home-baked chocolate chip and almond cookies to a gift certificate for a nice eatery in town (since I had mowed her lawe and few times)! But that wasn't the end of the gifts. She proceeded to give us 2 Philosophy Skin Care Products. My spouse had heard of them in a recent review in a popular magazine, but it was all brand new to me. Karin said that it was a gift for both of us and she wanted us both to use the exfoliator AND the moisturizer too. My spouse was thrilled to death with the new "products" and I was more thrilled (at that time) with the warm chocolate chip cookies.

Before bed we started to use the 2 products. Applying quality products was not new to me and over the years I've spent a few thousand in quality products to reduce my oily skin that often lead to acne-even after I turned 30. I didn't expect anything other than the ordinary smoothe and clean feeling after exfoliating, combined with the relaxed and cooling feel of the moisturizer. BOY-What a surprise I was in for!!

This is not a joke and I am not here with any special interest-other than to give a totally honest review of these products. My skin, in just 3 weeks, went from oily (with some combination areas) to normal and from shiny to glowing. Most impressive of all, was that (without any sort of drying effect on my skin) my facial acne is 90% gone. And I'll be truthful in telling you, in this review, that when my face is clear and looks good, I FEEL GOOD TOO!

I didn't have severe acne, but it was enough to consistently bother me and surprise me when I least needed an "outbreak!"
I'm sold on these products and am online to purchase products for my Mom and her 2 Sisters in New York. I used to work as a professional actor and model, mostly doing television commercials and some print work. So I've tried just about everything and I've had some luck with other products-but NOTHING like the overall masculine and finsihed look that Philosophy Products brought to me. I'm 100% sold and I hope that this review was helpful to you. It's from mmy heart and it's the truth. I hope and pray that you have similar or even better results that I have experienced. Good Luck To You! You won't be unhappy with these products, all of which are under a great satisfaction guarantee (another reason I tried them)!

Let me know how it works out!

This is without a doubt one of the best items I've ever bought.  I have very fair, very dry skin.  I need a moisturizer that will give me SPF protection that's over 15 (this has 25) and something that will absorb into my skin, and not feel liked I just smeared Vaseline on my face.  One jar (1.7oz) lasts for a long time, a good 6 months at least!  (A little goes a long way)  Some lotions have an obnoxious smell; even when it does say "fragrance free," this lotion has a clean smell, not bothersome at all.  I really feel like I'm doing something healthy for my skin when I put this on, like I've armed my face with what it needs to get through the day.  "Super Defense" is the right name for this moisturizer!  I do not go out into the day without wearing it.

I discovered the Caswell-Massey line by accident; having bought brushless Burma shave from another internet provider.  When I ran out I searched "Amazon" first and discovered this product.

At any rate, I believe that the scent is accurate.  In addition, the preshave oil followed by their sandlewood shaving cream gives one as close a shave as I have ever experienced.  Used to suffer from 5:00 "shadow", being in sales this is unsightly; after using the C.M. product that is a thing of the past.

This excellent product is expensive.  However, a hot, wet lather shave for this reviewer makes this mundane chore pleasurable.  The badger hair shaving brush is a nice addition or it makes a great gift.  

A British concern, Truefitt and Hill also are of interest to shaving and personal care customers

I am also a fanatic of sandalwood products and have searched the world (literally) for same. I have found this brand to be slightly different than one might expect from sandalwood, but still very pleasing. A little pricey, but not more than to be expected for sandalwood. I've also tried their after shave, soap, and shampoo. I've been very satisfied with all of these sandalwood products and will continue to purchase them until I find something better.

The first time I used this soap I didn't like it at all until I got out of the shower and felt my skin.  It was really soft and smooth.  I can't quite agree with the others about the smell though.  I found it kind of medicinal, but it could be just the bar I got.  However it lathers really nicely and everytime I use it my skin is so soft.  So I will buy it again, maybe the next batch will smell a little better

This soap is great! It smells like the ocean, really! Seaweed and sea salt gently exfoliate your skin, and pine, lime, and lavendar give it a really fresh scent that leave you feeling clean and rejuvenated after washing with it. 

I'm going to buy a big old chunk of this stuff next time I go to Lush, then cut it myself into a chunk of soap that's mostly seawee/sea salt, to use for scrubbing in the shower, and another that's mostly glycerine, just for washing my hands at the kitchen/bathroom sinks. The smell is great, so I can't limit myself only to using it once a day in the shower, right? Right!

This stuff lathers up better than most other Lush soaps I've tried. The scent is perfect for women OR men - very unisex, which is nice. I really don't like most flowery, female scents. Even my husband used this stuff

HI

LUSH's Sea Veg soap is one of my favorites.  Perfect for men and women because the scent is more refreshing then anything else.  That's because of the loads of lime in the soap.  This soap gets you super clean and the top of the bar is covered with real seaweed (super mineral rich) and sea salt grains that are great for exfoliating away dead skin.

Though it is a glycerine based soap, it doesn't 'melt' away as fast as I thought it would.  My half-an-inch thick slice has lasted me more then a month and I still have a lot to go.

Highly recommended

        Yep, my mate grinned when I told him one of my new favorite soaps was Sea Vegetable.  

	He's no longer laughing, he's using MY soap!  Neither masculine nor feminine the scent of Sea Vegetable is  totally refreshing, laced with lavender and lime oils.   Do believe he's thinking of becoming a pirate as he sings away in the shower, sudsing with MY soap.  Remember what it's like to walk along a beach when the day is fresh and new?  That's reminiscent of this fragrance.

	Deep blue in color the soap is topped with a wave of Atlantic sea salt crystals - so invigorating!  It gives the skin a bit of a tingle and softens at the same time.

        There he goes again - singing at the top of his lungs.  Well, I have a refrain for him: "Yo, ho, ho, matey!  Forget that bottle of rum and buy me another wedge of Sea Vegetable!

I have tried this product as well as others by Mustela and I think they are fenomenal.  I gained 60 pounds with my first pregnancy and did not get strechmarks.  You must be very disciplined and put it on everyday.  Although this cream is a bit pricey, it does wonders at hydrating your skin so why not pamper your body!!!

I've tried a lot of different blotting sheets and these are the best. These definitely blot the oil off your face and leave just a little bit of powder so you look fresh. I've tried the Body Shop's and the powder free ones don't work as well, and the powder ones leave too much powder on your face. I love these things

Another top Lush product.  My husband and I used this in our hot tub on vacation and had so many bubbles that they overflowed the tub!  I also like the idea that if you travel a lot, that you don't have to worry about bottles leaking.  It's kind of fun to see what colors you get, as it is a suprise.  Well worth the money.

I used to shave my bikini area regularly and got so tired of the razor bumps and ingrown hairs that came along with it so I decided to give Brazilian bikini waxing a try. The results are much more precise, longer lasting and smoother. But I was still getting those big ugly ingrown hairs. So the wax technician gave me a couple sample bottles of TendSkin. There was a noticable difference after 24 hours but I still had quite a few bumps remaining. I don't know if it was because I'm so suspectible to ingrown hairs or because I had so many to start with but it took a couple of months for my bikini area to completely clear up with twice daily application of TendSkin. I also exfoliate my bikini area several times a week - exfoliation will go a long way in preventing ingrown hairs. With the exfoliation and the daily application of TendSkin, the ingrown hairs are completely gone. I now use TendSkin only once a day and that is sufficient. My bikini area has never looked better. My only gripe with TendSkin is the cost - I put off buying a bottle for the longest because it's so expensive. I have one of the small 4 ounce bottles that I found at the less expensive price of $13 but that's still a bit much for this product. I'll continue to buy it because it works but it'd be nice if it were a little cheaper.

And for those who are wondering about the rubbing alcohol smell, I found that on me it disappeared as soon as the TendSkin dried. So don't let the smell of it deter you - if you are prone to ingrown hairs, TendSkin is the product for you. And to help it along, it's also a good idea to exfoliate the area regularly. :

I've been wearing Lucky You for several years now.  I really like it a lot!  I can't even tell you exactly what kind of scent it is...  It's not flowery, it's not fruity and it's definitely not "old lady!"

It's fresh, like clean laundry and it makes me feel youthful!  In fact, for some reason, it always reminds me of that Debbie Gibson perfume from the 80s, Electric Youth...  With the neon pink spring in the bottle!  Ah, the good ol' days!

I LOVE this foundation. I have Warm Sand Moisture Rich Foundation. It is incredibly smooth, long wearing and the color makes my skin look bright and radiant. Bobbi Brown makes very natural foundation colors and there is a range of colors for all different skin tones. When I'm shopping it seems that most lines cater to lighter and medium skin tones, but Bobbi Brown really does come through with flattering options for all skin tones. The only draw back is that this foundation does not provide adequate SPF protection, even though it says SPF 15. Therefore, you will still need to wear a sunscreen underneath of at least SPF 15. I use this foundation every day and I wear sunscreen from Paula's Choice (which I love). I think that the color options available, the long lasting color and the smooth texture make this foundation worth the price.

I really like this product. It does leave your hair quite soft and shiny. I have very thick, curly hair so anything that can make my hair softer is great in my book. I applied the treatment, wrapped my hair up in a plastic bag, and put a hot towel on it. I microwaved the towel every few minutes to make sure it would stay warm. I left the treatment in for about 40 minutes. When I first recieved this product, I thought the scent was actually pretty gross. But it does smell better after you wash it out.

I used this product for the first time over the weekend and the smell is amazing! Just like fresh baked gingerbread cookies. I have very thick, medium length, naturally curly hair - I left the product on for about 45 minutes and my hair turned out soft and shiny. It's 2 days and 2 shampoos later and I can still catch the faint smell of gingerbread. Wonderful

Okay, I am a bit biased because I have a soft spot for Polo products but the Polo Black is arguably the best I have used in years. And I use and finish a new cologne every month. The after smell is great, it is not overpowering, it is great in the morning and in the evening. Plus it doesn't hang on your clothes, so if you wear your shirt again, it doesn't have this "hanging" smell. For the first time in years, I am going to use the same cologne for 2 consecutive months! A great product

I love the consistency of this lip balm.  It's light, and not sticky.  The smell of this balm reminds me of lemon bars, and I love it.

The reason for the 4/5 stars is two things.  Sometimes the smell is a little overwhelming.  This is entirely a personal preference, and is only something that happens some of the time.  The other reason is that the balm tends to not last very long on me, and I find that a little annoying.  I usually just reapply, but that means that I end up using this up faster than a lot of glosses that I have used.

I definitely am going to buy this again, but knowing full well that I'm just going to be buying it again sooner than I'd like

Although this lip treatment costs a fair amount as far as lip balm goes, I don't know how my lips would live without it! It smells like lemon cookies and has a velvety finish... and it has SPF 15, too. The ceramic tube is easy to find in your purse and doesn't break easily. After using this lip balm for a week, my lips were already less chapped. I reccomend this lip treatment for everyone

Imagine pouring creamed coconut and vetivert oil on your hair, now imagine this was made into a bar and it foamed into lush moisturizing bubbles. This shampoo bar is pretty amazing in how it deep cleans and moisturizes like a dream. Your hair will feel super clean and shiny and I like following this with the American Cream Conditioner. 

Mmm, I can't stop running my hands through my hair, it is just amazing! The last time I remember my hair being this soft was when I was about 10! I rarely say wow, but WOW. If you love this, "Godiva" is calling your name. The shampoo bar, I mean...

I'm not really excited about the coconut scent. I can take it or leave it. The shampoo itself is good, though. I have very long thick hair, and this leaves it feeling soft, yet clean and not weighted down. I'm left with a lot of body afterward. I haven't had any trouble getting it to lather, but if you're new to Lush products, give them a few tries before giving up. They don't have silicones and other products to weigh your hair down, so you will see some changes in your hair as it is getting healthier

I bought this on a trip to Canada ... my hotel shampoo was very drying.  

The shampoo is weird to use the first time, I lathered it in my hands like soap and then worked it through my fine long hair. Not too oily for me and I really like the smell. It took care of the dry fly away feel the cheap stuff in my hotel had left.

I brought several different sized chunks back to friends who all thought it was fun.

I purchased the index 1 kit from [...] for [...].  I asked my hair stylist to apply to my hair.  She agreed to relax my hair with this product just out of curousity.  My scalp did not burn in the process.  It smelled like any other relaxer.  It straightened my hair.  I would continue to use but the price is too steep for a stay at home mom like me, but I wanted to try it after reading about in Essence magazine.  Vanessa L Williams said she uses it and her hair feels terrific.  I have very fine hair.  It had been nearly a year since I relaxed my hair.  I was giving my hair a break.   I usually relax my hair every 3 months.  My hair stylist said she would not buy it.  She added it's like any other no-lye relaxer

I have read all the Phyto Index 1 reviews to date...most negative ones sounded as if they either chose the wrong Index or needed a hair professional to apply the product properly (one must be highly skilled to apply this professional product by one's self and work quickly in application) and be able to judge how to gauge the proper relaxing time...as a trained cosmetologist, esthetician and registered nurse I have used both Index 1 and 2 on friends and relatives with great satisfaction...as a woman of Native-American and Afro-American heritage who has thyroid dysfunction (which can negatively effect the quality of one's hair and scalp) I have used the Index 2 with tremendous satisfaction

I absolutley love Murad's Acne Spot Treatment. As soon as you feel a spot coming up just dab a little on and its gone in 1-2 days.  Murad Acne Spot Treatment works without making the spot look scaley and dry and it helps reduce the redness of the pimple.  I would recommend Murad Acne Spot Treatment to anyone who has a small breakout problem to the most severe breakouts

I received a free sample of this and although I don't have acne it comes in very handy for the occasional blemish that I used to just cover with concealer until it went away. I had once tried Mario Badescu's formulation of basically calamine lotion which you would not want to wear out in public. I got a blemish recently and after just a few applications of Murad's Spot Treatment it was banished. It's clear with no dry feeling and doesn't show up on your face. It works and works fast

Marc Jacobs" the fragrance is young, fresh, and sensuous. It's pure, understated, simple, and unforgettable. 
Somehow he has done things with gardenias unheard of before. Remember granny's favorite gardenia perfume, a bit cloying, heavy? Uh-uh forget that. This interpretation of gardenia is cutting edge, it complements without overwhelming the wearer. 

Notes of Sicilian Bergamot and Tagete mingle with the top note, as accents of White Pepper and Egyptian Jasmine enrich. 

This is a fragrance for confident, unconventional young women.

Perfect for a weekend vacation or as larger sample sizes, the natural products will make your skin feel moisturized and pampered. Rice Bran is the secret to these products and the results are immediately apparent in the texture of your skin. After just one to two uses, you start to notice a sense of calm and order descending upon your formerly sensitive skin. 

If you have oily or combination skin, you may be amazed at how balanced your skin is and how you no longer experience the shine breakthrough in your makeup due to the initially drying aspects of other cleansers. 

1. The Komenuka Bijin Facial Cleansing Foam is very economical and an eighth of a teaspoon is enough for a wonderful face cleansing experience. The ingredients include: Rice Germ Oil, Rice Bran, Coconut Oil, Seaweed, Aloe Algae, Ginkgo Biloba, Matricaria, Yeast, Perilla Ocymoides, Honey, Lithospermum and Fountain Water. 

2. Follow the cleanser with the Komenuka Bijin Skin Lotion and you may wonder why you are suddenly catching the scent of SAKE. In fact, this cleansing toner does contain SAKE along with Rice Bran, Seaweed, Aloe, Yeast, Glycyrrhizate, Orange, Lemon, Matricaria, Algae, Luffa Cylindrica and Fountain Water. The toner completes the process of removing impurities and also has the added benefit of contracting the pores so they look smaller. Men may also enjoy this as an aftershave lotion. If the toner is not included, they normally include the NS-K Special Toner with even more healing ingredients. 

3. The Moisture Cream goes a long way. The main oils are Rice Germ Oil, Jojoba Oil and Olive Oil. Vitamin E, Rice Bran and Aloe make this a skin-healing treat. 

4. Eye Moisture Jell - Also contains apple acid, lemon, seaweed and loquat leaf. Smooths the delicate eye area. 

5. Makeup Remover - A fragrance-free cream that removes makeup and mascara. Based on olive oil. 

6. Two Cleansing Powder Packets - Deep cleansing grains turn silky and creamy when you add water. 

7. The UV Cream is slightly tinted and waterproof. This sunblock also seems to even out skin tone. Could be used as a makeup base if you are looking for a more natural look. The cream is easy to apply and absorbs easily into the skin. You can apply this on its own or after the moisture cream and skin essence. 

8. Skin Care Cream - A body cream that is very healing with jojoba oil. 

9 &amp; 10. Hair Shampoo &amp; Conditioner - Thickens fine hair instantly. Removes buildup and leaves your hair feeling luxurious. 

If you are looking for an easy way to try out the skincare system or you just want to take these products with you wherever you go (they are addictive), then I can highly recommend this and any of the Komenuka products. I love how calm they make me feel. These products cover all bases and whether you live in a cold, dry or humid climate, your skin will feel protected. 

Other products to fall in love with: 

The Skin Essence contains Mulberry that naturally lightens discoloration from sun damage and aging. The antioxidants help to revitalize the skin. This is applied before the cream. 

Moisture Cream Silver - Super hydration with aloe, vitamin E and Rice Bran.

Almost all the colors that this lip gloss comes in are very ordinary. Very light pinks, frosty pinks and oranges, and browns are the basis of the colors. Flirt, Pixie, Babydoll, Whimsy, Fantasy, and Piglet are not a very wide range of colors, but they are still nice. I'm not so sure about Oxygen, though. I have never really seen silver lip gloss, so I don't know how it would look on me. Hello, people, why not make a shade of red? Red is a classic in any lip color, so that's a color to try. What about a dark pink? Or a bright orange? If you were thinking of coming out with these colors already, great. But is not, those are some suggestions

This is a very complex scent, and mellows after wearing for awhile, but still leaves a subtle scent for quite a while.  Especially effective worn with the body lotion and shower gel

My daughter has very sensitive skin and these are great.  They clean her face and hands in between baths, and don't irritate her skin at all.  I really like the scent too.  If you don't like the way other Mustela products smell you won't like these, but if you do then you'll love them.  My only complaint, and the reason they didn't get 5 stars, is the packaging.  The package tends to not stay closed after a few days.  So if you aren't using the wipes regularly they can dry out

i have wavy hair and apply "be curly" to my wet hair before blow-drying with a diffuser.  it makes soft, non-frizzy, non-crunchy waves and has a fantastic herbal scent.  what i don't understand is why this website charges 4 dollars more per 6.7 oz bottle than the aveda store or aveda website.

This H20+ Tango Mango Shower and Bath Gel is wonderful.  The gel is so thick and supple with bath beads that your body will thank you for it.  The mango aromoa will lift your senses first thing in the morning and get you ready for the day!  I have to hide this stuff or my children will use it all up  -  they like to squeeze the gel out and pop the beads inside.

I suggest this bath gel if you want to give yourself a shower or bath treat.  It's well worth the money and would be a great addition to a "relaxation" gift basket for a friend

Looking for a tropical smell to take you back to your summer vacation in Maui?  This is it... all packaged in a bottle and a heck-of-a-lot cheaper than the airfare it took to get you there!  The exotic gardenia fragrence will put you in a trance as you float through your day... imagining yourself next to the Four Seasons pool instead of in a carpool with your children and their friends!  

I purchased this in Tiburon, CA on our way home from Napa last year and I've found myself reliving that initial moment when I first sprayed it on in the boutique.  My friends and I all melted at the aroma.  I've used it everyday since and have purchased more for myself and some as gifts for others!

I love to take my morning shower, towel dry and spritz this all over!  My senses are heightened and I'm off for a day filled with whatever -- it really wouldn't matter what took place b/c I feel so fresh and flirty -- ready to take on the day!

I highly suggest you make the purchase now and stop waiting for something to push you over the edge!

I have been using this product for 3 weeks now. It has definitely helped my acne-prone oily skin look more refined and toned. The only caveat to the product is that it mildly stings after you put it on. I have found that it does control oil production throughout the day. Overall, a good product! Works well with the Glycolic Foaming Cleanser

I happened to go to Neiman Marcus over my lunch break to check out some new lipgloss at the Yves Saint Laurent counter and ended up at the Bobbi Brown Counter.  The sales lady talked me into letting her put the rouge on my cheeks in the color - pale pink.  Wow it made me look so good. It made me look like I was glowing or flushing from the inside there was no telltale marks of blush on my face. I bought it on the spot. This did not have as great effect on my lips, it looked like I had lipstick on, but I'll just use it on my cheeks. I highly recommend this product.

This is absolutely my favorite bubble bar. They did not skimp with the patchouli, and the result is divine. Blue Skies' fragrance combines wonderfully with several of the bath bombs, so experiment. I have to admit, I am addicted to LUSH

Woo, the bubble bar that I got must have been really fresh! It was enough scent for 3-4 baths, but that wouldn't have been enough bubbles, so I used it for 2 baths that smelled VERY strongly! 

Not really a very relaxing scent, more of a refreshing, up-and-at-'em morning scent. It will definitely wake you up. The patchouli smell, which I love, is stronger in this bubble bar than in other Lush products. 

Suggestion: I would combine this with a karma bath bomb (also has a hint of patchouli scent) for a great combination of smells! 

The blue skies bubble bar WILL turn your bath water a scary blue color, but that's ok, because it smells good and leaves your skin silky smooth with its essential oils

I've been using this bar for at least 7 years...the absolute best color, best smell, and most relaxing bath.  I don't know what I'd do if it was discontinued!

Smells wonderdul and not masculine at all.  It is woody but light and intoxicating; I can't stop sniffing it after a bath.  The price is high but it is a large bar.  I usually cut it up and still have plenty of bubble/scent power

I ordered the 30-day supply of the Murad Acne Complex--just to see what it was all about.  I have always had oily skin and those little bumps on my forehead--but my biggest problem was blackheads on my cheeks/nose and those painful red bumps that always show up when I shave.  After only a week or so of being on the Acne Complex, I IMMEDIATELY noticed a reduction in the post-razor bumps as well as the little red bumps on my forehead.  And the refining mask is AMAZING!  Let it sit on your face for 10 minutes and you'll be amazed at how it makes blackheads DISAPPEAR.  Plus, Murad's formula doesn't have any of that drying benzoyl peroxide, which means no irritation, no drying, and no bleaching the collars of your expensive shirts.  If you've got acne problems, you owe it to yourself to give Acne Complex a try

I recently washed my hair with all of Carol's Daughter Tui products and after I blow dried my hair and put a little oil in it, it was very soft, manageable and easy to wrap.  Overall, I think it's a great product
