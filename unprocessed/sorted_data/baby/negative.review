I registered for the entire Locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it. I love the theme, but the mobile was a big disappointment. It didn't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available, he just couldn't attach it safely and we ended up returning it. Also, although the mobile matches the theme, I found that the colors weren't very stimulating.

We bought the Tiny Love Symphony In Motion Mobile instead and although the colors didn't match, our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it.

Alas, we have the entire Locomotion set but the cute little mobile won't fit our sleigh-style crib.  I called Babies R Us to see about some sort of conversion kit, but there's no such thing.  I'll be returning it this weekend and getting some crib toys instead.  :-

We bought this when our baby was born (6 months ago, only used it a few times until recently). He loves it now to get him to sleep. The problem lies in that at 4 am, my husband and I awake to hear the mobile playing...scares us to death since no one else should be around to start it. We go into the nursery and our child is holding it playing with the animals....the clip that holds the umbrella part had broken off, causing the mobile to fall on the baby. (He thought it was the funniest thing in the world, he was okay, thank God.) But the little plastic hook piece was in his hand. If you have a 6-month old child you know that they eat everything they can find. I thank God that he didnt put that in his mouth. It is a great soother for the baby, but be sure there are no defects every day! 

Like I said before, other than this, it has been great.

In order for a cordless monitor to have any privacy, you need it to be digital and use digital-spread-spectrum (DSS) technology. 900 Mhz is the best frequency for a baby monitor, though. Here's why: It is important for people to know that if you have a wireless network in your house, that it cannot share the same frequencies at any other 2.4 Ghz devices. This includes baby monitors and cordless telephones. The correct arrangement should be:
Baby Monitor: 900 Mhz Digital-Spread-Spectrum (DSS)
WiFi Netowrk: 2.4 Ghz
Cordless Telephone: 5.8 Ghz Digital-Spread-Spectrum (DSS

We have had nothing but problems with the receiver.  We have it in our kitchen and it's no more than 30 feet from our son's bedroom.  Any time we walk near the receiver it beeps from loss of signal.  The beep is very annoying because it won't stop until you move out of the way.  If we open the fridge door it beeps also.  We've tried all the frequency combinations with no luck.  It is also very subsceptible to interference and makes loud crackling sounds, even at low volume, until you change the frequency.
When it works the sound quality is very good, although it is hard to lower the volume enough so at night you are not awakened by your child simply rolling over or babbling in their sleep. 
We recommend the Angelcare Movement Sensor and Monitor by Bebe Sounds.  The sound quality is great and it comes with a sensor pad that you place under your baby's mattress. It senses each time your baby takes a breath.  If there is no movement it sounds an alarm.  Great insurance against SIDS!

This monitor is only great if your house is smaller than our Tokyo apartment. Although the monitor is sensitive and clear, moving the receiver any more than 15 feet away from the transmitter results in intermittent and loud beeps indicating a loss of signal

We live in a 1.5 story home where the master is the only thing upstairs &amp; my husband runs an ISP from home - LOTS of computers in the house, so we had to find a good monitor that would drown out the static of the electronics &amp; outside world, but allow us to hear our little pip-squeek clearly.
At first I was thrilled the Sony when I used it downstairs during her daytime napping &amp; loved that I could set it to voice-activated &amp; only hear it when she's reallllly awake! But that night when we used it upstairs it kept picking up interferrence in the form of a loud static chirp after several hours of silence even though it was on voice-activated mode. I tried moving it several times, but finally ended up going back to the old FP sounds &amp; lights one we had which really wasn't any better! (AND having to run up &amp; down the stairs to try all the combinations of 9 channels on the receiver &amp; transmitter of the Sony was a royal pain!)
 The next day I went to Target &amp; found The First Years Digital 2.4ghz Monitor &amp; what a difference! It was about the same price as the Sony, but it searches for a clear channel like your phone does. I was afraid it would interfere with out 2.4ghz phones, but after a week, no problems &amp; we have NO static/interferrence! It's crystal clear no matter where in the house (hubby even took it into the computer room &amp; was able to hear her wake up just fine!) I know everyone's environment is different, but the Sony definately didn't work for us

This product is not a safe product and should not be used with your child. Not only does it give additional padding that was not intended, nor tested with your safety seat, but it also voids the warranty of the safety seat. NHTSA (National Highway Traffic &amp; Safety Administration) is the government agency that sets standards for child safety seats and states that "after-market products" should not be used. It also does not meet FMVSS213 standards as stated in the manufacturer's description

We had to buy a new pack n play because our other one was coming apart. I chose this one because of its features and colors. My daughter hated this and screamed every time we put her in it. We tried for days to get her to use this, but she never would. So, we returned this and got a different that she absolutely loves.

I wore the baby plus with my first pregnancy.  I will say our child is a bright, out-going 8 month old now, but in the beginning she WAS colicky and a terrible napper! I thought this was a brilliant idea, but began to realize that many of the bright, gifted children I know didn't have exposure to this system.   It is loud to wear and not so comfortable.  You are instructed to wear it an hour at a time and can be quite maddening. Good luck if you choose to purchase, but just think, einstein was fine with out one

I love this swing because it goes side to side, she can sit when awake, lay down when asleep, and once you put her in she is out cold. After 6 weeks of using it I thought the battery was going, but when I changed the battery the music was still slow and I still had to keep the swinging motion on high, two weeks later it just stopped working. I'VE ONLY HAD IT FOR TWO MONTHS AND HARDLY USE IT, JUST A TOTAL OF 3 HOURS A DAY GIVE OR TAKE A FEW

The Leak-O-Matic fully lived up to its name.  As a new parent, I don't have time to do things once, forget about doing things twice.  I need simple and reliable- the Leak-O-Matic is neither.  It worked OK for the first few times, then I partially filled the tub and put all the items nearby necessary for bathtime.  By the time I returned with baby in hand, the Leak-O-Matic had dribbled all over the laundry room counter, soaked all my other items on the counter, water ran down onto the floor, under the baseboard, and dripped from the upstairs landing onto the downstairs foyer floor.  The Leak-O-Matic is the Hindenburg of all baby bathtubs.  It is too bad that I cannot give it zero stars. 

There are many people who say that you just have to assemble them correctly, but judging from the number of irate mommies here, I conclude that it is either too a complicated design or just plain crappy engineering.  Think about it- the number of people with young children who took the time to go online and tell everyone that this thing is a piece of cheese!  

The cups on the feet stick to the countertop so you are unable to positon the tub once it is attached.  The fabric mesh incline allows the baby to slide down into the water, so you're always repositioning the baby.  I'm surprised that this thing didn't come with a built in toaster for 'added safety'.

I did not research every single item on the registry- I figured that if the big stores carried it then it must be at least "OK".  Back it goes.  If you buy this thing, then good luck to you, and don't burn the toast!

WORST PRODUCT EVER! Safety 1st should recall this item if they have any sense at all. 

I'd like to smack the so called engineer that designed this infant tub.  My 10 month old son pinched his little privates so bad it gave him a blood blister. Yeah, OUCH!!!  The stinkin bar that goes between the legs slides in and out of place when the baby moves --SNAP! It pinches their private part.  Everything was just fine and then suddenly my son looked at me with such panic and then screamed and cried. I realize what had happened and quickly moved the bar.  OUCH! It still makes me grit my teeth when I think about it.
 
Horrible product especially for baby boys.

I'm not certain why there are so many glowing reviews for this product.  My wife registered for this item because the 4 stage tub looked good in theory.  Unfortunately, because of the collapsible design this "bath" tub does not hold water, it just runs out of the seam where the two sides come together.  There is a foam gasket around the seam that is intended to hold the water in, but it is useless.
The sling is useful for bathing an infant, and the removable ring does it's job of keeping an infant upright while learning to sit.  Unfortunately, by the time our infant was ready to sit we had already replaced this piece of junk.  I guess they call it Safety 1st as your kid can't drown in a dry bath tub

I bought this because I love all the other Fisher Price Aquarium stuff we have. But... we haven't been thrilled with this tub. The hammock can only be used until the baby is 10 lbs if i'm remembering correctly -- well our child was over 9 lbs at birth... so she used it like 2 weeks. Even so, the hammock sags onto this HARD BUMP in the middle of the hammock so the baby's back rests on this bump. Never seemed comfortable. Then we used it with the hammock attached only at the top like the instructions say but our daughter outgrew the infant side because her butt would slide right over the bump that was supposed to support her but she can't sit up to use the other side. There are better tubs out there

I am just writing to say that I LOVED this tub until my baby was 2 months, and at 26 inches tall her head was hanging over the edge and we could no longer easily shampoo and rinse without getting water everywhere.  Also, the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out...wet Mommy and Daddy!  So it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we'll use it when she can sit up, but I'm thinking we'll just use the big tub when she can sit up!

This high chair was great to start, but after a while the tray table would come loose on one side during meals. I thought it was me, at first, not latching it correctly but we soon realized it was my 9 month old releasing the clasp. 

Reluctant to change chairs we persevered and now, 3 months later, she can remove both sides entirely and send the tray and its contents crashing to the floor. I am worried that she will either trap her fingers as the tray comes loose or bruise her legs as the tray falls to the ground. 

If you are looking for a chair to last you into toddler-hood and your child learns quickly, don't buy this one. I am looking for a replacement before my daughter hurts herself

I bought this chair because of the great reviews, I hesitated at spending so much, but figured that all the features would be worth it considering my son would be using it for a couple of years. 
Pros:
I like that I can roll it around to the table, or to the sink to clean up after meals. The height adjustment is easy and convenient. 
The cons:
Folding it up didn't quite work as I thought it would. It didn't lock into the folding postition...and didn't really save that much space. I would prop it against the wall, and hope that no one knocked it down. We finally stopped folding it up. The toys that connect to the tray were too dangerous for my son, as he would usually hit himself in the face with them when he was younger, by the time he was older, I didn't really need them. The battery operated toy has a funny smell to it whenever it's been running for a while. He did like it...but the buttons were too hard for him to press when he was younger. My son discovered at 7 months how to pull off the extra tray that can go into the dishwasher, so we don't use that. He's 13 months now, and last week discovered how to disconnect the tray itself and fling it off of the high chair. I washed the seat cover per the instructions, and half the time did not use the dryer, even though it said it could go into the dryer, and now the seat is bubling and cracking...I have to place a cloth diaper in the seat to protect my son's legs. If I had not spent $90.00 on the chair I would not be as disappointed...but he's only used it for 7 months.

I don not like these washes at all. The scent is very very overpowering!!!!! I had to mix only a little of one with another unscented brand and it is still too strong. I do love the case though. It is sturdy and has lots of room

In order for a cordless monitor to have any privacy, you need it to be digital and use digital-spread-spectrum (DSS) technology. 900 Mhz is the best frequency for a baby monitor, though. Here's why: It is important for people to know that if you have a wireless network in your house, that it cannot share the same frequencies at any other 2.4 Ghz devices. This includes baby monitors and cordless telephones. The correct arrangement should be:
Baby Monitor: 900 Mhz Digital-Spread-Spectrum (DSS)
WiFi Netowrk: 2.4 Ghz
Cordless Telephone: 5.8 Ghz Digital-Spread-Spectrum (DSS

We have had nothing but problems with the receiver.  We have it in our kitchen and it's no more than 30 feet from our son's bedroom.  Any time we walk near the receiver it beeps from loss of signal.  The beep is very annoying because it won't stop until you move out of the way.  If we open the fridge door it beeps also.  We've tried all the frequency combinations with no luck.  It is also very subsceptible to interference and makes loud crackling sounds, even at low volume, until you change the frequency.
When it works the sound quality is very good, although it is hard to lower the volume enough so at night you are not awakened by your child simply rolling over or babbling in their sleep. 
We recommend the Angelcare Movement Sensor and Monitor by Bebe Sounds.  The sound quality is great and it comes with a sensor pad that you place under your baby's mattress. It senses each time your baby takes a breath.  If there is no movement it sounds an alarm.  Great insurance against SIDS!

This monitor is only great if your house is smaller than our Tokyo apartment. Although the monitor is sensitive and clear, moving the receiver any more than 15 feet away from the transmitter results in intermittent and loud beeps indicating a loss of signal

We live in a 1.5 story home where the master is the only thing upstairs &amp; my husband runs an ISP from home - LOTS of computers in the house, so we had to find a good monitor that would drown out the static of the electronics &amp; outside world, but allow us to hear our little pip-squeek clearly.
At first I was thrilled the Sony when I used it downstairs during her daytime napping &amp; loved that I could set it to voice-activated &amp; only hear it when she's reallllly awake! But that night when we used it upstairs it kept picking up interferrence in the form of a loud static chirp after several hours of silence even though it was on voice-activated mode. I tried moving it several times, but finally ended up going back to the old FP sounds &amp; lights one we had which really wasn't any better! (AND having to run up &amp; down the stairs to try all the combinations of 9 channels on the receiver &amp; transmitter of the Sony was a royal pain!)
 The next day I went to Target &amp; found The First Years Digital 2.4ghz Monitor &amp; what a difference! It was about the same price as the Sony, but it searches for a clear channel like your phone does. I was afraid it would interfere with out 2.4ghz phones, but after a week, no problems &amp; we have NO static/interferrence! It's crystal clear no matter where in the house (hubby even took it into the computer room &amp; was able to hear her wake up just fine!) I know everyone's environment is different, but the Sony definately didn't work for us

I registered for the entire Locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it. I love the theme, but the mobile was a big disappointment. It didn't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available, he just couldn't attach it safely and we ended up returning it. Also, although the mobile matches the theme, I found that the colors weren't very stimulating.

We bought the Tiny Love Symphony In Motion Mobile instead and although the colors didn't match, our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it.

Alas, we have the entire Locomotion set but the cute little mobile won't fit our sleigh-style crib.  I called Babies R Us to see about some sort of conversion kit, but there's no such thing.  I'll be returning it this weekend and getting some crib toys instead.  :-

We bought this when our baby was born (6 months ago, only used it a few times until recently). He loves it now to get him to sleep. The problem lies in that at 4 am, my husband and I awake to hear the mobile playing...scares us to death since no one else should be around to start it. We go into the nursery and our child is holding it playing with the animals....the clip that holds the umbrella part had broken off, causing the mobile to fall on the baby. (He thought it was the funniest thing in the world, he was okay, thank God.) But the little plastic hook piece was in his hand. If you have a 6-month old child you know that they eat everything they can find. I thank God that he didnt put that in his mouth. It is a great soother for the baby, but be sure there are no defects every day! 

Like I said before, other than this, it has been great.

This product is not a safe product and should not be used with your child. Not only does it give additional padding that was not intended, nor tested with your safety seat, but it also voids the warranty of the safety seat. NHTSA (National Highway Traffic &amp; Safety Administration) is the government agency that sets standards for child safety seats and states that "after-market products" should not be used. It also does not meet FMVSS213 standards as stated in the manufacturer's description

We had to buy a new pack n play because our other one was coming apart. I chose this one because of its features and colors. My daughter hated this and screamed every time we put her in it. We tried for days to get her to use this, but she never would. So, we returned this and got a different that she absolutely loves.

I wore the baby plus with my first pregnancy.  I will say our child is a bright, out-going 8 month old now, but in the beginning she WAS colicky and a terrible napper! I thought this was a brilliant idea, but began to realize that many of the bright, gifted children I know didn't have exposure to this system.   It is loud to wear and not so comfortable.  You are instructed to wear it an hour at a time and can be quite maddening. Good luck if you choose to purchase, but just think, einstein was fine with out one

I received this swing as a gift. I really liked that it was more of a cradle swing, that the tray was removable(in fact I never even put it on and it was great), and the fact that it swings side to side, like a crade, or front and back, like a normal swing.  My baby loved it, the music, the mobile, etc.  In the early months, it was the only place that she would sleep without me, so I loved the few moments of sanity that it gave me.

What I didn't like about it was #1, it uses a zillion batteries if you use the mobile regularly, and #2 the speed control was pretty stupid, I thought since all the speeds were the same, no matter which setting you have the swing on.  But if you can live with these complaints then this is an awesome swing

I love this swing because it goes side to side, she can sit when awake, lay down when asleep, and once you put her in she is out cold. After 6 weeks of using it I thought the battery was going, but when I changed the battery the music was still slow and I still had to keep the swinging motion on high, two weeks later it just stopped working. I'VE ONLY HAD IT FOR TWO MONTHS AND HARDLY USE IT, JUST A TOTAL OF 3 HOURS A DAY GIVE OR TAKE A FEW

The Leak-O-Matic fully lived up to its name.  As a new parent, I don't have time to do things once, forget about doing things twice.  I need simple and reliable- the Leak-O-Matic is neither.  It worked OK for the first few times, then I partially filled the tub and put all the items nearby necessary for bathtime.  By the time I returned with baby in hand, the Leak-O-Matic had dribbled all over the laundry room counter, soaked all my other items on the counter, water ran down onto the floor, under the baseboard, and dripped from the upstairs landing onto the downstairs foyer floor.  The Leak-O-Matic is the Hindenburg of all baby bathtubs.  It is too bad that I cannot give it zero stars. 

There are many people who say that you just have to assemble them correctly, but judging from the number of irate mommies here, I conclude that it is either too a complicated design or just plain crappy engineering.  Think about it- the number of people with young children who took the time to go online and tell everyone that this thing is a piece of cheese!  

The cups on the feet stick to the countertop so you are unable to positon the tub once it is attached.  The fabric mesh incline allows the baby to slide down into the water, so you're always repositioning the baby.  I'm surprised that this thing didn't come with a built in toaster for 'added safety'.

I did not research every single item on the registry- I figured that if the big stores carried it then it must be at least "OK".  Back it goes.  If you buy this thing, then good luck to you, and don't burn the toast!

WORST PRODUCT EVER! Safety 1st should recall this item if they have any sense at all. 

I'd like to smack the so called engineer that designed this infant tub.  My 10 month old son pinched his little privates so bad it gave him a blood blister. Yeah, OUCH!!!  The stinkin bar that goes between the legs slides in and out of place when the baby moves --SNAP! It pinches their private part.  Everything was just fine and then suddenly my son looked at me with such panic and then screamed and cried. I realize what had happened and quickly moved the bar.  OUCH! It still makes me grit my teeth when I think about it.
 
Horrible product especially for baby boys.

I'm not certain why there are so many glowing reviews for this product.  My wife registered for this item because the 4 stage tub looked good in theory.  Unfortunately, because of the collapsible design this "bath" tub does not hold water, it just runs out of the seam where the two sides come together.  There is a foam gasket around the seam that is intended to hold the water in, but it is useless.
The sling is useful for bathing an infant, and the removable ring does it's job of keeping an infant upright while learning to sit.  Unfortunately, by the time our infant was ready to sit we had already replaced this piece of junk.  I guess they call it Safety 1st as your kid can't drown in a dry bath tub

I bought this because I love all the other Fisher Price Aquarium stuff we have. But... we haven't been thrilled with this tub. The hammock can only be used until the baby is 10 lbs if i'm remembering correctly -- well our child was over 9 lbs at birth... so she used it like 2 weeks. Even so, the hammock sags onto this HARD BUMP in the middle of the hammock so the baby's back rests on this bump. Never seemed comfortable. Then we used it with the hammock attached only at the top like the instructions say but our daughter outgrew the infant side because her butt would slide right over the bump that was supposed to support her but she can't sit up to use the other side. There are better tubs out there

I am just writing to say that I LOVED this tub until my baby was 2 months, and at 26 inches tall her head was hanging over the edge and we could no longer easily shampoo and rinse without getting water everywhere.  Also, the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out...wet Mommy and Daddy!  So it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we'll use it when she can sit up, but I'm thinking we'll just use the big tub when she can sit up!

This high chair was great to start, but after a while the tray table would come loose on one side during meals. I thought it was me, at first, not latching it correctly but we soon realized it was my 9 month old releasing the clasp. 

Reluctant to change chairs we persevered and now, 3 months later, she can remove both sides entirely and send the tray and its contents crashing to the floor. I am worried that she will either trap her fingers as the tray comes loose or bruise her legs as the tray falls to the ground. 

If you are looking for a chair to last you into toddler-hood and your child learns quickly, don't buy this one. I am looking for a replacement before my daughter hurts herself

I bought this chair because of the great reviews, I hesitated at spending so much, but figured that all the features would be worth it considering my son would be using it for a couple of years. 
Pros:
I like that I can roll it around to the table, or to the sink to clean up after meals. The height adjustment is easy and convenient. 
The cons:
Folding it up didn't quite work as I thought it would. It didn't lock into the folding postition...and didn't really save that much space. I would prop it against the wall, and hope that no one knocked it down. We finally stopped folding it up. The toys that connect to the tray were too dangerous for my son, as he would usually hit himself in the face with them when he was younger, by the time he was older, I didn't really need them. The battery operated toy has a funny smell to it whenever it's been running for a while. He did like it...but the buttons were too hard for him to press when he was younger. My son discovered at 7 months how to pull off the extra tray that can go into the dishwasher, so we don't use that. He's 13 months now, and last week discovered how to disconnect the tray itself and fling it off of the high chair. I washed the seat cover per the instructions, and half the time did not use the dryer, even though it said it could go into the dryer, and now the seat is bubling and cracking...I have to place a cloth diaper in the seat to protect my son's legs. If I had not spent $90.00 on the chair I would not be as disappointed...but he's only used it for 7 months.

We ordered one, it didn't work well.  It seemed great, but it was a bear to fold when there was a little bit of wind.  based on all the reviews, we thought we must have had a defective one.  We ordered a replacement, but it seems to have the same issues.  Very disappointed.

I have had this swing a little less than 2 months. I bought it for my 5 month old because she wouldn't sit in a traditional swing and I thought this looked like a comfy place to nap. It was a lifesaver til a week ago and and the motor burned up. I called Fisher Price and the part is on backorder til mid- May. I guess I just got a lemon because everyone else's seem to be fine. I am TRULY disappointed in Fisher Price. They usually exceed my expectaions. I paid $150 for this and it lasted til the water got hot and thats about it

My almost- 3 yr old daughter needed a new umbrella stroller (she's tall, but still gets tired sometimes, especially if I take her shopping). I researched the options and picked the Maclaren Volo. My first stroller before it was Chicco Capri, and it always bumped against my legs, which was annoying and uncomfortable. When the canopy broke, I got rid of it and decided on buying a new one for plane travel and local outings.
The Volo seemed great - light, handsome, convenient, and highly rated by parents.
I ordered the stroller and, upon unpacking it, was quite pleased with its appearance. I read the instructions and learned to use it. The stroller seemed sturdy, well-made, and easy to maneuver, not to mention chic.
The washable seat was a good idea, I thought. I liked how large it was (perfect for an older child), and how easily it moved.
When I took the new Volo around the block, I noticed that one of the double back wheels was not aligned properly (one was higher than the other and did not rotate, which caused the stroller to make a scraping sound). Then the other set stopped rotating when one(!) pine needle got stuck in it! I had to carefully remove it with my hands in the middle of the street. Needless to say, that's not the quality I expected, since every parent I know raved about Maclaren. 
The canopy kept sliding off the rails, as well - something you would NOT want at the airport, with your toddler and luggage and the car seat in tow.
When I got home, I looked at the wheels closely and tried to adjust them, but to no avail. They were flimsy (I could dent them with my finger if I wanted to!), way too small and just poorly designed. I immediately packed up the stroller and returned it to Amazon. 
I was very disappointed. One would think that for such a high price, the wheels would be usable - after all, they are the most important feature of any stroller.
I will stay with Chicco and order a C6. At least I know that the wheels are great, and you can't beat the price

I usually love The First Years products.  I already had the fisher price healthy care booster seat and loved it.  I wanted to leave that one at my parents and have one to travel with so I thought I'd try this one.  I was expecting to love the swing feature, it was the one thing I thought was missing out on the fisher price one.  Well, I returned this chair w/in 24 hours and bought a second fisher price one.  Here are the reasons why; The base of the chair is hollow and wobbly, it is also very wide and didn't comfortably fit across a normal kitchen chair.  You have to attach the straps yourself when purchased and they are also too wide.  At their tightest level they were still way too loose to be secure.  Thought the swing out feature would be great but when the tray swings out, and then you wipe baby's hands, as you're putting your hands under his pits to lift him off, he's already got his hands in the leftover mess on the tray.  The back of the chair comes off every time you fold it down.  You have to take the chair apart to adjust the level.  And when folded up, it's not as compact and portable as fisher price's model.  Do yourself a favor and splurge the extra $5 for the healthy care booster seat.

This seat is a great concept, it just doesn't stay together very well.  I took it back to the store and they marked it as "defective".  For a few dollars more, I got the "Healthy Care Booster Seat" from Fisher Price.  I've had much better luck with it

We got this for my son. We had it for 2 months. When he would get excited and try to Bounce he would end up hitting his head on the hard Toys. Last week my son hit the play bar hard enough that he loosened his top front tooth. It was the scariest thing that has ever happen to me. Nothing is worse than seeing your helpless baby bleeding from the mouth. Over the course of a week he was crying and not wanting to eat much. He lost the tooth on the 8th days. When he hit the play bar it cracked his tooth just below the root. Now he will be with out a tooth for 4-6 years. Please choose another product for your child. It's not worth the risk

I bought this seat for my fifth child. She loved it at first, but then about the second week we had it, the plastic at the top of one of the legs snapped as I was putting her in it. Luckily I had not let go of her yet, because the whole thing fell apart on the floor.  The rattle ball also broke off within the first couple of weeks.  Upon investigation, the company only offers a 15 day warranty and that does not cover "material failure". I will not buy anything else from this company.  Not only are their products poor they are down right dangerous

  I bought this for my 4month old for Christmas, I liked the pretty, bright colors and the sounds the foot pad would make.. she was a little small when I put her in, but nothing a thin blanket tucked around her for support wouldn't fix, and a pillow under her feet.  She wasn't heavy enough yet to push the foot pad to make noise, all of those things she would grow into though.  The part I couldn't over look though is how close all the toys were to her head and how hard the toys were.  She tried to chew on the see-saw (teething, everything goes to the mouth) and it was too hard and hurt her gums so crying she jerked her head back and bumped it on the mirror behind her.  It was a pitiful sight. Poor baby. I don't know why they didn't allow just a little more tray space  and curved that silly bar out more so they wouldn't bump their heads.  I think a little more thought put into the product and it could be a great toy, but as it is now I think it's just a little too "rough around the edges".  I took mine back to the store and then bought an Evenflo, she fits in it much better and so far she LOVES it.

For all the things we had heard about it being a suffocation hazard at a later age, it actually had potential even in the very beginning. Our little one actually used to slide down it as the night progressed, leaving her in between the wedges by the time she would wake. We tried tightening it to her as much as possible, and she still scooted down it. After a few too many attempts of this we stopped using it altogether. Maybe our baby was just too squiggly, but honestly I just found it dangerous. I think it is a great idea, but the product needs some work.

I got this as my older son, 8, had the regular type of wedge. THis one doesn't keep my new infant from going from a side position to his back, nor does he stay at the same height on it.
Every night he slides down from his head being towards the top to his head being between the wedges. This to me is a tremendous suffocation hazard. I was very excited to get this as a gift and had even registered for it, but have been very disappointed with it's performance. Also, the foam lost its bouyancy after less than a month. THere's an indentation where I laid my son.

I read several of the reviews on this site to choose a new mattress for my babies room.  I have a great crib from USA baby and I noticed how the first review stated that she didn't buy the super expensive mattress from USA Baby (160.00) which I did for my first baby and it was great.  It was a super snug fit in the crib and now in her toddler bed it still is a perfect fit.  I decided that for this baby I didn't want to spend as much for a mattress because it did seem silly. HOWEVER, this mattress didn't fit snug in my crib nor did it have the firm feel.  This is a medium quality mattress for a medium price.  I bought it yesterday and took it back today.  I am going to go with the expensive mattress that I know fits and is perfect for long term use.

We received this mattress as a babyshower gift 4 years ago (I was registered at Babies R Us).  My first child used it for a little over 2 years.  My second child has used it for nearly 2 years.  Neither child is big (in fact, one is rather petite). Even though the mattress was not abused, it cracked and ripped in numerous places.  I'm currently researching the 'lifetime warranty' policies from Kolkraft.  I don't recommend this mattress.

We had a really cheap monitor before we bought this one because it was just so noisy.. so we bought this one thinking it was going to be quieter.  Well, it is ALOT quieter than our monitor, but like others said, it makes this awful beeping noise!  It has gone off twice in the middle of the night before!  We also have another digital phone, so it is constantly switching channels as well trying to find an available channel.  I would look elsewhere for another monitor.. The beeping is what gets to me - I dont like being woke up by a very loud beep in the middle of the night!

We had the Fisher Proce sound and lights monitor and decided to go digital.  This was the one we picked in our price range.  We had it for a few weeks and absolutely loved it...until there was some weather changes.  Every time the weather was not clear the monitor could not find a signal and made a terrible beeping sound!  Buy the sound a lights for $15 and save the extra money!!

After a concerted effort to get this monitor to work acceptably, I returned it. This is one of the few products I've had that truly made me ask, "What were they thinking?" The monitor gives off a loud "out of range" beep whenever it's not in good communication, and there's no way to shut it off. Compound that with the fact that it will intermittently think it's out of range even when it's just in the next room, and it is completely unusable when parents are trying to sleep. But that's the least of it. The voice-activated mic clicks loudly in and out when it decides to transmit, or not. This is annoying, but all the moreso because when it decides to transmit seems to have absolutely no correlation to when there is actually sound in the room. And finally, the transmission is absolutely unintelligible: it's marred by a lot of what sounds like digital compression artifacts that garble the sound--speech absolutely cannot be understood over this monitor. In short, in no respect is this a functional product

This was the worst monitor we have ever had, and we have had several with our kids.  It says the range is 600 feet, but it doesn't even reach 200.  Our cordless phone reaches twice the distance.  The light makes it very annoying at night.  It beeps loudly for no reason and cuts in and out frequently!

OKAY, FOR STARTERS, I DID LOOK AT THE VARIOUS OTHER REVIEWS AND THOUGHT I WOULD TAKE MY CHANCE. IT SEEMED THE GOOD OUTWEIGHED THE BAD. UNTIL...I BOUGHT IT AND AM TRYING TO INSTALL IT (AS WE SPEAK BUT GOT IRRITATED SO AM TAKING A BREAK TO WRITE THIS.) WHERE TO BEGIN, THE LOCKING MECHANISM SEEMS TO BE FINE IF YOU CAN GET IT TO INSTALL IN THE FIRST PLACE. HOWEVER, THE MANUFACTER ONLY INCLUDES SCREWS FOR WOOD WALLS. WHICH MEAN, IF YOU DONT HAVE WOOD WALLS YOU HAVE TO GO BUY OTHER SCREWS! I HAVE DRYWALL AND THE SCREWS ARE NOT RELIABLE. SECOND, I BOUGHT THIS GATE WITH THE EXTENSION (24", THE ONLY ONE THERE IS) BECAUSE THE TOP OF MY STAIRS MEASURE 44 1/2 INCHES. THIS GATE IS SUPPOSED TO FIT THAT WITH THE EXTENSION. IT DOESNT. I HAVE TRIED FOR OVER AN HOUR TO GET IT TO FIT AND IT DOESNT FIT EVEN WITH THE EXTENSION. IT WOULD WITHOUT THE EXTENSION HOWEVER THERE IS ABOUT A 5 INCH GAP FROM THE WALL TO THE BOLTS ON EACH SIDE AND THAT IS WITH THE BOLTS ALL THE WAY UNSCREWED ALSO. NEEDLESS TO SAY IF I WANT THIS GATE TO WORK, I HAVE TO GO TO MY LOCAL HARDWARE STORE AND BUY NEW HARDWARE SO THIS WILL MOUNT SECURLY OR I HAVE TO TAKE IT BACK TO THE STORE AND FIND SOMETHING ELSE. UNLESS I CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE IT FIT HOW IT IS, THIS GATE HAS BEEN A WASTE OF MY TIME AND MY MONEY. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT 2 STARS IS BECAUSE IM SURE IT WOULD BE JUST FINE IF I HAD WOOD WALLS AND IT FIT TO WHERE I CAN INSTALL IT. NOW I HAVE HOLES IN MY WALL AND CONFUSSION TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT FIT IF ITS AT ALL POSSIBLE. DOESNT LOOK LIKE IT IS THOUGH.

I got this bra when I was pregnant and wore it confortable until my delivery.  After my delivery the bra was too small.  With the engorged breast after delivery and just carrying mature milk afterwards it is just too small.  I wasn't told that my breast would get even larger after delivery.  I thought they were big just before delivery.  

I decided to go w/ bravado bra.  It has worked out much better.  It is comfortable to wear day and night. And as the milk comes in and out it is comfortable either way.  The sizes are more flexable then medela.  The strap support is better then medela.

I have packed up the medela bras and will just use them during pregnancy if i have another.  No use for them when i am not pregnant or for breastfeeding.  And breastfeeding is their main purpose

This bra is very comfortable once on.  Getting the bra on however is not always as comfortable since it goes over the head.  It rolls together and is hard to get adjusted correctly over your body.  As far as function it is not easy to resnap one handed, which with a baby is all you usually have to work with.  The star rating is only for comfort, 0 stars for function

I like the idea of all this in one case (and it's hard to complain at this price), but some of these things would be better bought separately. We've either traded up or found a substitute for most of the things in here. Here's what I found: Item #1) The case is fine, but things do fall out all the time.  #2) I haven't used the tweezers yet, but the magnifying part sounds nice.  #3) The nail clippers were WAY TOO SHARP. We cut my daughter's skin more than once (but one was serious enough that we considered a hospital trip!) Now we use my regular clippers, and I haven't gotten her skin since. The soft grip thing actually make them slide around more, so it was tougher to cut where you wanted to. Trust me, it's easy to clip skin on fingers that little!  #4-7) The emery boards are very handy, but any emery boards would work.  #8) We got a different thermometer; this one was too slow. Faster ones are more expensive, but they're worth it for a sick squirmy baby.  #9) I haven't used the medicine dropper, but the one time she did need one, I actually asked at the pharmacy desk at a grocery store, and they gave me one for free (then later I found out we had this one.)  #10-11) The brush and comb are nice. I'm sure they can be purchased separately from the kit for less.  #12) My daughter's only 7 months old, and has no need for a toothbrush for awhile, since there are no teeth (and even when there are, I believe you wipe them with gauze, not a toothbrush for awhile.)
Basically, although this kit had tons of things that could be helpful and it wasn't very expensive, we have either gotten an upgrade on the things we use (thermometer), or have found other things that would work just as well (regular nail clippers, free medicine dropper.) I'm certainly not saying that you shouldn't get one, because I'd hate to say that and then have you find that you needed it. If you get it for a shower gift, great; if not, you can find substitute items just as easily

I have seen this product( and others similar to it) .  As an RN,we encouraged prospective parents to refrain from being drawn in by the "cuteness" of items that are geared only to be sold, not to be useful.  Although each category of item in this kit is certainly useful,and some essential, it is far better to spend your money on the items purchased separately.  In this way, you can check for quality and longevity.  Put together your own kit.

This was given to me as a gift, and although I have used it, it would not be my first choice in infant care.  The nail clippers are mediocre at best, I understand they shouldn't be sharp for an infant but I have to exert tremendous pressure just to clip my son's nails.  The syringe is too hard of a push to administer medicine and the tweazers couldn't pull a hair out of my head - they have absolutely no grip.  I have never used the brush, comb or toothbrush (I have others) but they do make for good entertainment when diapering!  The case is cumbersome and of poor design.  Everytime I open it - everything falls out!

I have small hands, so I actually can't grip this product with one hand. It slips right out, because there is no hole. The items are okay, really don't like the nail cutters though, and they don't stay in there places.

I'm sure there are better kits out there

The thing you are likely to use most is the nail clipper. But it is very blunt!!! And the special cover on the clipper makes cutting the nails impossible, unless baby's nail is very very long. If I wait until the nails are long enough to cut by this thing, my 3-month-old would have scratched his face and head. I end up buying a new baby nail clipper with a big handle and magnifying glass from nearby pharmacy. That worked much better.

I will never order an item like this again as it came destroyed! They need to repackage items like this for shipping. It it the second and the last item of this type I will order online. The other was a bassinet and it also arrived broken with the box destroyed. I have complained before but never get a response...too bad too as I like Amazon

This was the only gate on the market that I could find that would fit the 12 foot doorway between my livingroom and dining area. It stated easy to install but when the screws kept breaking off inside my new woodwork and I kept having to redrill holes I was a bit angry!!!! I suggest predrilling your holes!!! The hinges  also won't stay on and the swinging gate doesn't line up. You need 2 hands to close the gate which as a busy mom of 5 children you don't always have 2 hands free! By the end of installing this gate it was about to be throw out

I bought this to puree my 6 month old daughter's homemade baby foods.  You put the blade at the bottom of the cup, load the food in, then put a protective plate and finally put the top piece (which contains the motor) on top.  The concept seemed good and it is a compact size.  CONS:  1) The cup holds less than 1 cup of food...if you go over that amount, any liquids in the food start to splatter through and make a mess, and sometimes causes the motor to stop running...guess it shorts it out and I have to wait until it dries out before I can start again.  If you're trying to make enough to freez cubes of food, you'll have to puree several batches.  2) You can only run the motor for short periods of time...up to 20 seconds max or something like that for some foods.  This is fine for soft foods, but if trying to puree meats, for example, it sometimes takes longer than that and it becomes a hassle having to grind, wait, grind, wait....3) the motor that powers the blade is way too slow, cooked chicken or beef ends up being too lumpy, since you really need a faster blade to puree them.  I've found that the for pureering baby foods, the best thing to use is a blender, since the blade speed is much faster and the design helps to draw foods down to the bottom so things can get more evenly pureed.  Don't waste your money on buying this

Before I even had the opportunity to use this product, it has disappointed me.  I have washed this item per the manufacturer's instructions.  The bottom pad came out of the drier all pilled.  I wonder how many more washings this pad can stand.  Truly a disappointment

This is one of those products that is good in theory but not in practice.  I thought, "OOh what a nifty idea, a head bumper!" The whole idea was great; BUT if your baby is a wiggle worm like mine, then the head bumper guard is a waste.  I actually found this item to be more of a hazard than anything.  Because my son wiggles while he sleeps he ended up with his arm stuck under the side guards wrapped in a semicircle around the bumpers.  Don't ask me how he did this.  The good thing was that if he wet through his diaper the pad underneath absorbed the urine.  Other than that it was a hassle to keep in the crib

I thought Tiny love products were good, so I bought this.  The first one I received had the water leaking out.  The second one doesn't make bubbles and after a few days the music already sounds like the battery is dying.  My baby seems to like it, but it does not live up to what it advertises

I like the music, but we have to have it on auto to play.  Because I have a mirror in the seat to see my son(he is still backward facing), I can't move the seal up farther so that he can reach the part to kick and make the item turn on.  Also, I have never been able to create bubbles like the instructions claim.  So just music plays.  There are plenty of other smaller items that can do that.  This thing also eats up batteries like you wouldn't believe.  I am changing them every couple of days, and we aren't in the car much.  What a disappointment!!  Good concept, but doesn't work well at all

Frustration is how I sum up my experience with this product.  On the front cover, and with the directions on the back, there is a photo of a key that locks and unlocks the magnetic lock.  However, after opening the packaging, there was no key.  There were four locks, alright.  And, lots of little screws in case you felt like screwing the lock in, despite the product's claim to be the only child lock that doesn't require tools.  With how the packaging is designed, I don't even think there's room for the key.  Which makes me wonder...do you have to buy the key separately?  I'm returning this product and am bitterly disappointed for the wasted time and energy

If your baby has fingers or teeth this is NOT a trap. They can easily take the lid off and scatter snacks about with glee.

For the first couple of weeks the Snack Trap worked perfectly. After that, my daughter (7 months old) figured out how to remove the top (it is just a soft plastic cover like a tupperware, but easily removed), and we have since been struggling to keep her from dumping, throwing, or shaking the snacks all around the house.

On the positive side, the flaps for the top are very soft, and when she does reach in, there is no worry about her harming her hands or fingers. If only the lid had a locking mechanism or was screwed on, then this would work perfectly. As it is, my daughter loves it, but we hate cleaning up the mess

It worked great the first time my 14 month old son used it but the second time, he figured out how to take the lid off and spilled his Cheerios everywhere.  I tried it a few more times after that and got same result.  The lid is WAY too easy to remove.

We are "training" and really were looking for a useful aid.  It didn't work for us, allowing the entire car seat and straps to become saturated.  We will continue to use it with our younger child, IN HOPES of avoiding a diaper "leak through" accident.

I bought two for my kids' seats.  They constantly bunch up and slip around.  Now I have to lose money in shipping to send them back for a refund. 

Don't bother with these.  Just fold up a towel.  It will be cheaper and just as convenient as these things

This product is absolutely useless.  Save your money.  The first problem with this product is that the area that is supposed to fit over the buckle part of the car seat carrier simply does not fit over it.  In addition, there's no way to attach it to the carrier, stroller, or whatever.  So when you try to put your child into wherever you wish to use it, all it does is slide around.  So it's more hassle trying to use it every time than just dealing with the occasional blowout

I ordered this item based on the great rating it got, yet when I received it I was unimpressed and found the size measurements to be wrong. I ordered a medium based on the manufacturer's notes yet when received found I needed a longer one. After researching how to return, since it came with no information on this, I found out you can not return this product from this store. I wanted to warn everyone before they purchase.

I purchased this rail today for my daughter's crib that "converts" into a toddler bed.  Everything on the outside of the box looked great, until we got home, put it together and put it on the crib.  There is only about 6 inches of space for my daughter to climb in and out of bed.  Also it sits in about 3 inches which significantly reduces the amount of sleep space.  After playing with it for awhile, I decided to look over the instructions again.  It states in the warning section that this rail is only for a bed with a box spring and mattress and is not intended for a crib or toddler bed.  My question is "WHY DIDN'T IT SAY THIS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOX?!"

I don't care what other reviewers say, but this bed rail sucked!!  I used it on my sons toddler bed since it seemed to be the only product that would accomodate that type of bed.  It took up so much mattress space that my son barely had room to sleep in his bed.  And it would constantly come unlocked.  And if I buy another bed rail for our next child it won't be a mesh one cause they get too dirty.  I can't remember if this cover was removable or not, if it was I'm sure it would have been a pain in the a** to remove

We bought this bedrail for a vacation home and thought it was great at first.  I realized I didn't like it sticking out so far from the bed when it was folded down, but could live with it.  The second weekend we used it, my 2 year old and his cousin, also 2, were climbing into the bed by stepping on the bedrail because it stuck out so far, and the side popped out of position, never to go back in.  As far as I am concerned, this product needs to be rethought by the manufacturer.  There should be some way to fix it when it pops out.  Definitely would not reccommend it.  To make matters worse, Babies R Us would not return it becuase we no longer had a reciept

If you have an infant that enjoys mental stimulation, this item is not for you.  Since she was brought home my daughter has enjoyed looking about and being held so she can see all around her. She was bored to tears (literally) every time we put her in the lounger (the baby faces the ceiling.. not too exciting).  I thought it was a cool concept, however, my daughter did not.  She did much better in her papasan, or bouncy seat where she could nap if she wanted to, but have the option to look around and play as well.  Looking up at the ceiling was not fun for my daughter

I received this sheet and was immediately disappointed.  The quality is very cheap and it wasn't a perfect fit.  I am surprised that this is made by Graco - usually their products are good.  I would not recommend buying this. I would buy a regular crib sheet instead.

Just a note to thank all of the parents who take the time to post their opinions ... I find the "customer reviews" a tremendous help when trying to make decisions on "grandma" needs!  I also advised my pregnant daughter to check them out before making a final decision on anything!  Thanks to all of you again!

I don't have an abundance of money, but I would definitely pay double if the quality of the sheets was better. I don't even want to know what the thread count is on these sheets... From what I understand, these are the only sheets that fit the thing, so I guess I'm just out of luck. Hope to see an alternative to these sheets real soon.

The product says that around 20 weeks you should be able to hear the baby's heartbeat.  Well, I'm 30 weeks now and I still can't hear the baby's heartbeat while using it.  It was a total waste of money.

doesn't dry your bottles at all. It leave a condensation and doesn't dry completely. I give it one star for all the stuff it holds, but water leaks out so you have to put something underneath it.

We bought this item, because we could not find what we were looking for anywhere else. We had it about 3 weeks and the piece that holds the nipples/caps broke off and now everytime we go to set bottles on it, we have to attach it back on. Not very durable.

I researched many car seats and settled on this one. Safe and cute! But it has a *major* flaw:

The strap that comes up between the legs is too close to the back of the seat. My daughter, only five months old, was already almost sitting *on* the belt where it comes out. This mean that the buckle was way too low and tight, forcing the belts to cut into her chunky thighs and pushing uncomfortably on her pubic bone. 

I asked around online on some forums, and found many other mothers who returned this seat for the same reasons. Many mothers didn't find it a problem until their child was at least 20 lbs, but it was a problem for me already, because we use cloth diapers, so my baby's butt is bigger due to the 'padding.'

This car seat wouldn't work well if your child is chunky or uses cloth diapers... and even otherwise, I can't see how it would work for a child over 25 lbs or so... The Britax Roundabout has the croth belt at a different location, a few inches further out from the back of the seat, so it is the one I am getting as a replacement

Save your $$ if you plan to run with this on a jogging stroller.  On a mild windy day it flips up towards you and off to the side.  I didn't think it really shielded my baby from the sun like I thought it was going to either.  I would not recommend this product. It's very cumbersome. When I returned it to the store, there were two others on the counter behind the customer service cashier that had just been returned recently.

I read the reviews for this and decided despite some negative comments to give it a try since it was so cheap....at first I was impressed with this shade because it attached quite easily to my stroller and actually provided shade to my baby (although not as much as it looks like it would - his legs were never protected from the sun even though it looked liked they would be because the shade is so big). My stroller is a pretty typical stroller, nothing special or comlpicated about it.  But yes, it did flip up in the wind or even a small breeze very easily and i had to weigh it down which didn't really work because it is so flimsy.  After about 2 weeks it lost its shape completely and the front of it flipped up and no longer provided coverage AT ALL.  Piece of junk.

We should have been much more careful and read other customers' negative reviews on this crib mattress pad before purchasing three of them (eventually cancelled one).  We would not recommend this item.

After only one wash (despite having followed the laundry instruction), it shrank so much that it became impossible to fit our standard crib.  When I tried to stretch the sides around the mattress, they tore..

I loved this mattress pad when I first opened it, it's made of soft, natural cotton and offers a nice cushion for baby. However, after washing it, I found it's too small for the crib mattress, which is a standard size. I think they just skimped on material, or didn't pre-wash. It's a good 2 inches too short! It doesn't have much stretch to it, so I'm afraid I won't be able to use it all! Very disappointing

Well, I just tried the Bundle Me (toddler size) with my 20-month old in our jog stroller for the first time today and I am disappointed because it is definitely already too small. He really can't sit in the bag unless his legs are bent, which he hates. Plus, when I have the bag pulled as far down as possible in the stroller (the only way I can get him in at all), then it only zips to just above his waist -- definitely not high enough to really get warm and snuggly.

I'll keep the bag for baby #2, but I'm really disappointed I can't use it with my not quite 2-year old.

The Tubbly Bath Dispenser fit our spout just fine, but minutes later it would work itself off.  We tried everything to get it to work with no luck.  Fortunately, the company that sells it agreed to let us return it weeks later without a receipt or packaging.  Don't even try it...it's not worth it!  Look for something else.

I Bought this product for my 3yr. old.  At first I thought it would help her go to the bathroom when we went out but when she sits on the seat she has been pinched a few times.  At first she didn't want to sit on it again &amp;amp; she cried when I took her to the bathroom, but I told her I would sit her on it &amp;amp; I would lift her off.  Since I have been doing this she hasn't been pinched, but it took me a while for her to trust me. If you buy this product you have to be very careful or your child will get pinched

This seat is very dangerous and set my daughter's potty training back months. The seat folded and fell into the toilet while she was sitting on it! Thank goodness I was still holding her! She did get pinched and was afraid to sit on the toilet for a few months after! Potty training is stressful enough on a child without a defective product making it worse! The only reason I gave it a star is there is not a way to save the review with out one

When I ordered this product, I was hoping that my baby girl will enjoy it. I was so excited when my baby likes to spend time in it. This happiness only lasted two days before the mobile, lights, and music stopped working. I am a little bit concerned about the quality of this product. I have to return the swing and consider another type of swing for my baby.

For the price of this cradle/swing, I'd hoped for a lot more quality and reliability than I got.  First, the stand seemed a little wobbly--you really need to make sure that the feet are as wide as possible when setting it up as they don't lock into an optimal position.  Even worse, however, is that after less than two days of use, the lights, sound, and mobile stopped working.  Calls to "customer service" were a complete waste of time and I ended up returning the item.  While the netting and other features appeared attractive and desirable, I'd have to recommend purchasing a less expensive Papasan cradle/swing

I though it was just me but after reading several other reviews I see that others agree on just how difficult this thing is to assemble/disassemble.  The locks are impossible, the items do not quite fit right, and it would be impossible to get this thing into its "travel bag."  The mattress is thin and very lumpy; each fold in this mattress causes hard lumps.  I bought this product thinking I could use it as a portable play yard after my baby out grows the co-sleeper aspect but there is no way.  I recommend you avoid this product!

After my husband and I put this together using the TERRIBLE directions, we've been using this as a free-standing bassinet for the past 5 months (not attached to the bed, as some people do).  My daughter has been sleeping in it just fine.  However, we attempted to fold it up to take it with us on a weekend away from home recently.  What a nightmare to collapse!  Again, the directions are of absolutely no help.  It was impossible to get the whole thing into the carrying case and get it zipped up.  Also, this thing weighs a ton.  I now realize I need to buy something else to use when travelling.  How annoying.  Bottom line:  if you're going to set this up and never take it down, it's fine (once you initially get it put together, that is).  However,  if you think you'd like to use this on an occasional overnight trip away from home,  forget it!

I have a 3 and 4 year old and this device did little to deter or prevent them from raiding the fridge while their mom and I were asleep. A couple of good, hard yanks by your child and this device fails. This might me a good product for infants and toddlers, but if your child is over 2 years old, try something else like the Lock Release Fridge Latch by Safety 1st (but be aware that even though these are by far superior, you'll still have to place about 3 of these Safety 1st latches on your fridge door to keep the little ones from defeating them. That's what worked for us anyway. I'll be so glad when they grow out of this fridge fascination.

I think that I've tried every bag that I have found and have been disappointed with all of them.  These were just about the worst!!  My daughter was born prematurely and never really got the hang of breastfeeding.  I wanted her to recieve all of the benefits of breastmilk so I pumped.  I have pumped everday since the day she was born btwn 5 and 8 times a day.  I went through ALOT of bags (I use bottles now) and these were a pain.  They were small, thin, punctured easily, and those twist ties (although pumping directly into the bag is a great concept) were just a pain in the butt.  I love Medela's pumps (I own the Pump in Style Advanced, a seperate manual pump, and used the Lactina hospital pump for 3 months), I like their storage bottles, I even like their nipple cream, but these bags need some more work put into them

I do not like these bags.  The twist tie closure system is cumbersome.  The bags are small.  The plastic is thin and leaks in the freezer when frozen.  The only advantage I can see to these bags is that they are easy to hook to the medella breast pump and pump into directly

If you are looking to make a mess, lose milk and get frustrated, these are the bags for you.  First, these bags do no stand up on there own and it is very inconveniant to carry a little cup around to help fill the bag. You have to string the twist-tie into each bag by yourself.  Also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out.  It's not that easy.  The first time I did it I lost a whole bunch of milk.  Your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there.  The worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk.  This never happened with the other bags on the market.  My favorite is lansinoh.  Another bag thing about these Medela bags are that they are more expensive than the others.  Pass on this and try others

These bags leaked for me from both the top and the bottom.  The fold-down mechanism is very cumbersome especially because the plastic is very stiff.  I lost three bags of milk due to leaks.  If you have to transport the bags anywhere, like back and forth to work like I do, I would avoid these bags.  They just leaked all over the place for me, even after I carefully re-sealed each one exactly according to the package instructions.  I would recommend the Lanisoh bags over these.

The idea behind these bags is great - you can pump straight into the bag and store them. The execution, however, is lousy. Using twisties to seal the bags is cumbersome and annoying. 
I prefer the Lansinoh bags with the double seal. Even though you can't pump straight into them, sealing them is quick and easy

I registered for and received these Medela bags.  After using all 50, I got a few free Lansinoh bags with my breast pad purchase.  Wow!! I will never go back to Medela.  The reason I registered for them is because everyone says they are strong and don't leak.  Well this is the only good feature.  The Lansinoh bag is strong as well, easy to close (DOUBLE zip-lock Vs. Medela's bothersome twisty ties), easy to get the air out (unlike Medela's), and the Lansinoh's take-up WAY less room in the freezer! Stacking Medela bags in the freezer is difficult because of their shape...and thawing will be difficult because I can see I'll need to watch that the milk doesn't spill out the top.  With Lansinoh I won't have to worry about that.  My medela bags haven't split in the freezer...I'll give them that.  But neither has my Lansinoh bag.

I've tried lots of storage bags, and by far the Medela ranks the lowest.  These spill, you have to store them upright in the freezer...and if your freezer is as compact as mine with food to feed five people, storing milk upright is just too hard to do.  These bags do NOT have a ziplock seal on them, which means that they are leaky and unreliable if you are in a hurry (like if you have more than one kid and you work).

Buy the Gerber or the Lansinoh bags with the zip seals on them.  They can both be stored flat for more convenience, and they can stand on their own.  Pumping into a bag is fine if you are someone who wants to fumble with attaching it to the pump (the Medela bags), or you can use your Medela pump with your reliable pump kit and pour your milk into a Gerber or Lansinoh storage bag for ease.  I use the Medela Lactina Plus, and I find that this method works the best for me.  Simple, clean and easy.

I love my Medela Pump In Style but their breastmilk storage bags are awful.  The twist-tie closure is complicated.  They also spill milk easily when pouring into a bottle after thawing.  I recommend the Lansinoh bags.  They have an easy-to-use double zip closure to ensure that the milk will stay fresh and it's very easy to get the air out of the bag before closing.  You can also lay them flat to freeze so they won't take up much space in the freezer.  They pour great - no spills!

Well the fact that it is a leash was really not the problem, cause I mean when you buy it, you already know that! LOL 

My daughter would have more tantrums wearing it than not. Every time I would put it on her, she would scream and beg me not to put it on. It was really heartbreaking. On the plus side, this item really taught my daughter to walk next to me and listen to me LOL

We used it a couple of time and put it aside. She really hated it and I felt that it caused more tention than it is worth

Unfortunately you are correct - these are not the same Premium Heavyweight Cloth Diapers that used to come from Gerber.  When I called the company (I use these cloth diapers in my business) to ask, they told me this was the same product.  It is not. They quilt and wrinkle after one washing, and just don't hold up their shape in general.  Amazon needs to update their site, because the packaging has changed as well.  I miss the old diapers!

The item pictured and described is not the item you will recieve.  I ordered 4 pakcages of these diaper service diapers and got a completley
different diaper.  These are thicker, better quality and have blue stitching and "Gerber" stamp on them that distinquish them to be the diaper service diapers.  The diapers I got were thinner, plain white and had no stamp. Buyer beware!  You will not get what you see in this current photo

I started using these for cloth diapering with my first child.  They hold plenty and have held up pretty well.  the ones I havn't bleeched are still going strong after 6 years!  These aren't as great as Chinese Prefolds but then again they are a little bit cheaper, trimmer and you can get them when you need them rather than having to wait a week for them to arrive in the mail.  these are the best diapers sold in stores

After trying almost every bottle, I tried these and waht a nightmare! There are to many parts to clean and they leak! I called Dr. Brown's customer service line and they were on the defense and said you can not shake the formula to mix it- you have to stir it. As most people who use powder formula know this is not an option as just stiring very slowly as they say does not mix the formula. I saw no difference using these other than they leak and a pian to clean and have to use a special brush to clean them. I went with the Playtex Natural Disposables and never looked back

We used these bottles for three weeks, and we are very skeptical that they actually work as well as they are supposed to.  There are some additional drawbacks as well.
1)  These leak in travel.  Twice we've gone to the park with 7oz, and arrived with 4 and a mess in the bag.
2)  We see no difference in reducing gas. And while these are designed to take gas away from the collar on, what about all the air in the nipple where the air first enters?  Is this a gimmic?
3)  The flow is too fast.  We went from bottles with smaller holes and less flow to these, which are far too fast for an infant

I thought this product would be helpful for sleeping, since it was recommended from a friend. However it doesn't work for me. I took it out of the box and it was just in a plastic bag. After trying it for 5 minutes I decided that I didn't like it and tried to return it. The company would only issue store credit because I "opened" it. What a rip off

I tried Fisher-Price's Take-Along Jungle Swing then this Open Travel Swing. In both swings my baby would lean forward and fold himself in half in the seat. The Jungle swing was difficult to haul around since it didn't stay closed well and the "palm tree" was always in the way. Finally I bought the Fisher-Price Aquarium Swing. I found the seat of the Aquarium swing to be deeper and it clicks in place (so it won't fold over on baby) and it is easier to assemble and haul around.

The size of this swing is about all it has going for it and it is far from the best swing out there. I put the swing on the 5th speed and it barely moves, so much for the other 4 speeds. 

My daughter is starting to explore her surroundings and get into things which brings me to what I hate most about this swing. My daughter pulls herself into a straight up sitting position by holding onto the bars and stops the swing, looking like she is going to fall out. I just pray that buckle is secure! She also likes to get her head trapped in between the legs and the swing bars to where her head is hitting the bars. So, I don't like leaving her in the room by herself when she is in this swing. If you don't like to get house work done or take showers, this swing might be for you

We bought this about 6 weeks ago, and it has already stopped beeping when the nipple is sterlised or milk is warm. Now the markings on its measuring cup is coming off. 
Basically, I believe Minchkin has cut corners with poor quality product. Not recommended at all...I would prefer some other brand

I'm currently in the process of adopting my son, and I bought this to take to Guatemala with me when I visited. It never worked - it didn't matter how much water I put in the chamber, it would never cycle on more more than 30 seconds. I then had to wait approximately 5 minutes for it to cool back down before using it for another 30 second cycle. I ended up filling the ice bucket with hot water, and letting the bottle sit in that to warm up. 

Needless to say, it's been sent back. I think I'll just use the microwave when the baby gets home - it's got to be easier and quicker than this thing

The warmer made such a loud beep when it completed its task that it woke our baby up. So much so that we ended up staying near it to shut it off before it went beeping! Had to also physically pull out the power cord after each use as it had no auto shut off.

This stroller was great for a year and a half. My only complaint until now was the sunshade.... it doesnt block much sun when up and falls off when down and seems to always catch on things when folded... but I could deal with that for how light and easy this stroller is. It's easy to steer one handed when needed and folds down very compact. However, now I am suddenly having problems with it folding while in use. It does it with both my 2.5 year old and my 9 month old, so its not related to weight. Every time it's happened I have been right there, so there have been no injuries, but I am leary to put my children in it now. I contacted Chicco and was told, "Sorry, you are out of warranty" Their products carry a 1 year warranty, and I purchased mine a year and a half ago. I only gave 2 stars because it was 4 or 5 star worthy until it started folding on its own,..... otherwise I would try to give it no stars. Every Mom wants to feel that their child is safe, and I am now uneasy about the safety of this stroller

I tried this swing then this Fisher-Price's Open Travel Swing. In both swings my baby would lean forward and fold himself in half in the seat. The Jungle swing was difficult to haul around since it didn't stay closed well and the "palm tree" was always in the way. Finally I bought the Fisher-Price Aquarium Swing. I found the seat of the Aquarium swing to be deeper and it clicks in place (so it won't fold over on baby) and it is easier to assemble and haul around

I purchased this swing because we wanted something to take back and forth to our parents house. Though I am VERY sorry I purchased it. When you place the baby in the swing- the seat lays almost flat/horizontal (with the foot part of the swing MUCH higher than the head position??)Very weird?? While it swings, I am afraid my daughter could end up tipping the seat backwards and land on the floor. Also, there is no head support. On the box it says that it is age appropriate from birth to 25lbs- THIS IS NOT the case. My daughter is only 4 months old and she can hold her head- but not too great yet and there is NO HEAD support with this swing. My daughter ends up leaning way over to one side of the swing- it doesn't seem to have the support that other swings have. I have another swing the head support and positioning of the way the swing sits is MUCH BETTER. To add- the mobile is horrible. It's really pitiful and hard to believe that Fisher Price put something like that on the market. The entire swing has a poor design to it.

I purchased this swing because we were out of town and it was much needed.  We have the full sized Papasan swing and the travel Ocean Wonders swings at home (which in retrospect, we were wishing we brought with us).  While neither of those are 100% perfect, they are much better than this one.  The open frame allows the child to kick the swing frame, stop the swing from moving, and potentially get their feet/legs stuck in between the bars.  ALso, the swing seat almost lays horizontal (with the foot part of the swing MUCH higher than the head position)while swinging, to the point that I am afraid if my daughter would wiggle a bit, she would end up tipping the seat backwards and land on the floor. Lastly, the mobile is horrible.  It's pitiful and I find it hard to believe that Fisher Price put something like that on the market.  It's a plastic leaf that has little notches for two toys on strings.  The strings have a not on the end of them and you slide it into the notches.  These toys remain on the notches for approximately 3 seconds.  It's a very poor design and needs a LOT of work.  And my daughter ends up in a crumbled up ball on one side of the swing more times than not - it doesn't seem to have the support that our other 2 swings have.

That said, the swing is very attractive and appealing.  I only wish it were better made and more thought out.

I have looked at alot of other reviews before I bought and wished that I hadn't because. You can't go off someone else's experience, you REALLY have to experience it for yourself. First of all it's too bulky. The suction thing on the tub didn't stick and it was in the way when I tried to shower and kept falling down. My poor baby kept sliding because there is no non-skid at the bottom of the tub, so I had to go out and buy a small mat to put at the bottom. 

I bought this tub only because my baby was out growing the fold away bath chair but it looks as though I will have to continue using it and buy a larger one for her. I was very temped to send it back but I'm just going to sell it on ebay. 

I'm sorry but it was a waste of money for me. I'm happy that it did aleast work out for the other moms, maybe mines is defected!

This was the first bottle I purchased for my daughter when she was born.  I was breastfeeding but since she had jaundice, I had to suppliment formula for the first 2 weeks of her life!  I had the worst time with this bottle!  It leaked everytime I went to shake it and whenever I would try to feed my daughter she would literaly drown because the flow was too fast.  SHe would also gag and had horrible gas! I stopped with the formula till she was 6 weeks and I thought maybe since she was older she could take it a little better.  It ended up being the same problems again!!  I switched to the playtex nurser and those bottles are great! I would recommend them to anyone who is breast and bottle feeding!  My daughter did not get confused and she did not drown in formula!   Even though it is a little more work with the drop in system, I dont care!  I can push the air out of the bottle and she swallows less air and she has less gas and spits up less!

I was really disappointed in this "Sealy Ultra". It does not feel like a very good mattress. We'll use this for a couple months and replace it with something better. I'd say you need to see the mattress, decide the one you want and then look for the best price on the internet

I purchased this item from Target and had to return it to the store.  The wedge comes in 2 pieces of foam, and the foam is inserted into the cover.  The foam isn't the problem, it's the cover.  The zipper goes right down the middle, so it can't be comfortable for the baby to lay with the zipper poking out under their head/neck.  I would recommend the crib wedge that comes in one piece.  If the zipper were on the side, the product would be great

I bought this Thermometer when my second son was born, thinking it would be easy to use and good for the money. My husband and I tested it on ourselves to see how accurate it was. We both got 5 different readings. I didn't see what the need of the plastic covers were for, since we ran out of them quickly.(Not to mention, you can't find replacements anywhere.) My biggest complant was that after a month, the product completely stopped working, even after changing the batteries. I would suggest paying the extra money to get a better thermometer

I don't usually bother complaining about products, but this thermometer was such a waste of $, I just wanted to save someone else the trouble. The temperature readings on this are SOOO inaccurate. EVERY time that we check a temp. it is different, it varies alot. Just to see if it worked we tried 8 times in a row on ourselves to see what we got. Every time it was different sometimes by a few degrees. It reads low sometimes, so you may have a temperature and not be aware. And we couldn't even take it back to the store. Do yourself a favor by the regular digital thermometer.We didn't have any luck with a diffferent brand either, the ear ones are all off, but not as bad as this one

I bought this thermometer for my daughter when she was first born. It is AWFUL! It gives strange readings like 94.5 and 95.1, when in fact I know that she has a fever! I bought just a regular digital rectal thermometer at the pharmacy and it gives more accurate readings. Don't buy this, its a waste of time and $$$$$$

This thermometer is not very accurate or consistant. Whenever my son was sick and we used this it would give a normal temperature reading and I knew that it couldn't be right. We would take our sons temperature 3 times in a row and never get the same reading twice. I even check my own temperature and it would come up with crazy readings like 95.1! We got rid of this one because fever-induced seizures run in my husbands family and we needed something more accurate. It has been my experience that nothing digital gives accurate readings and that the old-fashion oral and rectal thermometers work best

I bought this to take my infant's temperature, since she doesn't like to sit and wait for her temperature to be taken under her arm.  I decided to test it before she was sick to make sure it was accurate, and it never gave the same reading twice.  First it was 95.5 and then 98.5 and then 96.2, etc.  I tested it on myself, my daughter and my husband.  Then I gave the directions and the thermometer to my husband to try to see if maybe I just wasn't doing it correctly and he had the same results.  I have taken it back to Target and am trying a different brand.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT

I was excited when I purchased this ear thermometer because I had an ear thermometer years ago that I loved. I was unfortunately very disappointed with this one's performance. The temperature seemed innaccurate when we were testing it right after purchase. Then about two weeks ago my daughter came down with a fever. I could feel that she was burning up, but the ear thermometer read 97.5 when I checked it (twice). I got out the oral thermometer and discovered her fever was actually 102.1!!!  
  
 Needless to say this thermometer went back to the store. I won't buy another ear thermometer until I can afford to get a better brand, like the one I had years ago (ThermoScan). :o

Okay, maybe I should have read the laundering instructions, which say to machine wash and then "drip dry" - but who makes BABY items that can't be machine dried? How many parents have the time to line-dry delicates?

The upshot is that this fell apart - melted in the dryer and got fluff all over EVERYWHERE - the first time we ever washed it. If you need something you can throw in the washer/dryer when it gets dirty and not worry about sorting, this is NOT your product. Grrr

I bought this for an older model Graco pack n' play we got from friends who no longer needed it.  The mattress measures 27" x 39" and before washing it my husband and I tried it out to see if it fit.  It's too small.  I know it's supposed to be snug but the mattress won't even lay flat with this sheet on it.  It seems like it'd be a great product, if only it were slightly bigger to fit properly.

My son is 8 months old.  He has outgrown his infant car seat, and is now in a larger seat, but still rear facing.  I bought the cradler to prevent his head from slumping forward when he falls asleep in the seat.  It does not help in this regard at all.  In fact, it just annoys him.  I have taken it off the car seat entirely, and I'm not using it at all.

Very disappointed in Californi

I bought this sling when my son was 8 months old and 19 pounds. He hated this carrier because he couldn't turn around and see the world. I hated this carrier because the rigid straps cut into my hips and shoulder every time he tried to move. The seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly (I tried numerous positions. There isn't a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable) and also said to tighten the straps so the baby couldn't move around. I did all of these things and still found it very uncomfortable to wear. The seller was helpful and the product arrived promptly, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. (Note: there is a $5 return charge.)

The biggest disappointment was that after 6 months, the tub began leaking air through an unseen hole- maybe in the seams (thus patch would not work).  Kel-Gar does not warranty the product, and the store that the tub came from (via amazon) only offered a 90 day warranty.  

Also, the tub is too wide to fit in a standard tub- only half the water from the tub spout lands in tub, the rest flows behind it.  Thus wasted water and it takes longer to fill

We ordered a tub from Baby Because which was delivered.  Then they mistakenly sent us formula someone else ordered. On route the formula fell off a UPS truck and was lying in the street for over a day.  A neighbor saw it and gave it to us. Baby Because contacted us saying they wanted the formula back to sell it. We expressed concern that they wanted to sell baby formula that had fallen off a truck and been lying out in the street for a day.  They said it wasn't our concern and to just give it back

I just received this product after much research, and I am really disappointed with it's quality. The mattres is so stiff and hard especially for a baby, and the sheets provided are like an emory board, scratchy and stiff. My baby is too long for this, so her feet fall off the edge of the mattres. I just thought it would be much better than this. Looks like I will be returning it.  My daughter is now sleeping in her bouncy chair, tied down at the back to reduce the bounce and with a fluffy pillow underneath it to also reduce the bounce

I only have the turtle and the fishing net.  
Turtle:  The turtle was used for about 5 months while my nephew stayed with me and then was put up until my new baby would be able to use it.  I dryed out all of the bath toys and they were stored in an open air toy bin for about 6 months.  I finally felt my daughter was ready for toys in the bath and put the turtle in the water and noticed black stuff floating in the water.  There was mold/mildew growing inside of the turtle.  I tried washing it with bleach water, but more kept coming out even after repeated washings.  I finally just gave up and threw it out. I had several other squirt toys stored with the turtle and none of them had the same problem. 
Fish net:  The paint on the fish net is peeling off after only 5 months use.  The fish themselves are fine.

A great idea, but very time-consuming to put on.  My advice is to use a regular Maya type sling for the first few months, and then get the Patapum.  It's the least pricey of the "structured" carriers which are the ONLY ones that put the weight on your hips, rather than your shoulders, and therefore spare your spine.

This item was suggested to me by my local birth center. I should have noticed the word "wrap", but I didn't give it too much thought. There are two main problems with this baby carrier:
1. You have to wrap every time you want to use it which is problematic if you have other kids who need attention and if you are wanting to use it out of the house. I live in SW Florida where in the summertime it is 100+ degrees. There is NO way I could stand in a parking lot, wrap myself up, put the baby in and get my other child without suffering from serious heat exhaustion.
2. It is HOT. Yes, this is a nice, stretchy breathable fabric, BUT, the fabric is much, much bulkier than standard baby carriers. Again, I hate to harp on the weather here, but there's no way I could take my other child to the park and wear this unless all I had on underneath was a tank top.
I'm also unsure how you would nurse while wearing this unless you had those special nursing shirts with slits in them. Otherwise, you'd have to jack your shirt up underneath the baby and the carrier to feed them.
On the plus side, it's easy to get wrapped up and easy to put a baby doll in and out of.

My 11 week old breastfed baby was diagnosed with mild acid reflux (she doesn't vomit, it comes up in her throat causing crying spells from the heartburn).  She also has a sensitive stomach and is gassy so we decided to try these when she was 8 weeks old.  They were horrible!  We like the Playtex Premium Nurser and the Playtex Ventaire (chubby bottles) MUCH better.  We tried the regular Dr. Browns, but she choked on the nipple so we ordered the chubby bottle that has the nipples more like the breast.  With both kinds she sucked too hard and ate too fast...when I sat her up to burp her after her usual 5 minutes (@ one ounce with the Playtex bottles), to my surprise she had already sucked down 3 ounces!  We had a horrible night both times we tried the Dr. Browns - she cried all night from a bad tummy ache from the fast flow (we used the slow flow nipples even!).  I also have a friend that had the same problem with her baby choking and gagging on the slow flow nipples' too-fast-flow (formula fed baby).  I HIGHLY recommend the Playtex bottles - they are easy to clean and never leak.  We only tried Dr. Brown to see if it would alleviate the GERD symptoms - it did not!!!!

I bought this wipe warmer as the weather got colder here in Georgia and so far have not been impressed. Two problems. 1) The wipes stay warm for about .0042 of a secod so by the time you pop them out and get them to your son's tushy they are lukewarm at best. 2) They advertise how intelligent their top warming design it, but that's only for the wipes that are touching the top of the product. Once you get half way through your wipes, there isn't any way for those wipes to benefit from the warming device (placed directly below the lid) since they cannot reach it. They should install some sore of spring device so that all wipes are touching the warmer no matter how low your wipe supply is getting. I will continue to use it but wish I had though more about the product's design

My husband and I purchased this warmer with gift cards we received for our second baby's birth.  We don't really like it.  Our wipes dry out down to about the third, sometimes fourth wipe.  That's makes for a 6-8 wipe diaper change!  (that's a lot of wasted money) Other reviewers are right about the wipes staying moist when it is not as full.  But with a newborn, infant or even a toddler I prefer the convenience of opening a refill pack and placing all of the wipes into the warmer instead of half the wipes in and then finding something to keep the second half moist until it's time to refill with the other half.  We had a wrap-around warmer with our first child.  It wore out around the time we started potty training her.  That's the style of wipe warmer I would recommend for new parents, not this one

We have the All Clear Swing Gate (hardware-mounted, not pressure-mounted) installed at the top of our basement stairs. Earlier this evening, I opened the lock, and as the gate swung out over the stairs, the top hinge snapped off the wall and the gate tipped away under my hand.

Fortunately, enough of my weight was behind me that I was able to correct my balance (just!) and did not fall headfirst down the stairs. But it was a close thing. An inch or a pound or a second either way and I -- or, god forbid, one of our children -- would certainly have been badly injured. While I was taking a photograph of the broken hinge, the gate itself, which was hanging precariously by its remaining hinge, fell off and tumbled down the stairs.

The gate has been in place for six weeks, but has only been in actual use for a tiny fraction of that time as we have been out of the house for five of those weeks. NB this was a product failure, not an installation fault. The screws are still firmly attached to the wall, along with what remains of the plastic flanges around the appropriate holes in the hinge. 

I purchased the gate after reading the enthusiastic reviews here, but after my experience tonight, I would not recommend that anybody buy this gate, ever. (The review gives one star, because NO stars is not an option).  And I would expect to see a product recall very soon

I went to the CHP office to get my car seat checked, and the officer said that car seat protection mats are not approved and considered a major safety hazard because it causes the car seat to become loose. If you use these mats, the car seat will not be installed tightly enough and can be a real danger during automobile accidents. DON'T BUY!

I have a volvo 960 sedan and wanted to use the seat saver in the middle seat and it DID NOT work.  The bottom section was too large for the space between the seat belt/buckle and did not allow the carseat base to be properly placed. My friend has one of those nylon seat protectors and it is much better

First of all the diapers get stuck in the lid, and then the room starts to smell like baby poop. Yes you can use reg bags for it, the only + about it. First day after changing the bag it smells OK but buy the 2nd WOW it stinks so badly and when you open it to change the bag the smell is unbearable.

Buy anything.  Buy a regular old trash can and throw your diapers in there because you'll get pretty much the same end result.  I don't have the pink Diaper Champ because I have a little boy but it's still a Diaper Champ and it is horrible.  I had a Diaper Genie with my older son (now 4) and gave it to my brother.  I wanted to try something else and was drawn to the Champ because you can use a kitchen trash bag....woo hoo...NO REFILLS!!!  So for three months now (that's how old my little butterball is now) I've used the Diaper Champ and the first day it's not so bad (maybe because the diapers are floating in the enormous amount of Lysol I spray in there and the fact that I use ForceFlex trash bags (for the prayer that they won't break when I'm disposing of diapers and flood the house with old baby poop) which also have Odor Shield (so the bags start out smelling so nice!) but already by day two, my husband is walking in the nursery saying "HOOOOOOONEY, it smellllllls!  I clean the thing all the time....the stench remains.  This week I ordered my Diaper Genie online.  I feel like throwing a party when it gets here.  I'll spend the extra few dollars on some refills if it keeps guests that enter my home from wondering what on earth died in my house.

I also had the older Diaper Champ and it broke so I got this new one, "New And Improved"! I don't know if they've ever tested this product. It's impossible to get the diaper bag out of the Diaper champ. It's big from the bottom and small from the top so when you try to get the bag out of it, it always gets stuck and if you try harder then the bag rips! It's absolutely horrible product. NEW OR SOON TO BE MOMS - DO NOT BUY THIS!!

We first had the original diaper champ, which I would have given 4 stars.  It kept the odor in pretty well, was easy to use, used regular trash bags...etc.  We really liked it until one day a velcro tab on a diaper pulled the foam out of the lid.  Since it was letting the odor out, we decided to replace it with the new and improved model.  WORST DIAPER PAIL EVER.  As soon as the diapers start piling up, the lid grabs tabs, wipes, etc and jams the top so you can't flip it.  I spent so much time shaking, wiggling and kicking the thing I was very quickly exasperated. When you flip the top, it created much bigger gaps on the two sides than the older model.  This is why things get jammed...also why it lets a huge waft of diaper odor out every time you flip it.  HORRIBLE

This step stool is a safety hazard. The sides are not angled enough so a two-year-old can easily step too close to the edge and tip it over. In fact the stepping surface is so small that it's hard for a little guy to stay in the middle of it. And when the stool is tumbled over a little explorer can hurt himself badly when he falls onto the sharp edges of the legs

This cute turtle was terrific for about a week.  My toddler loved it and enjoyed the stars and color options.  Unfortunately, the button you press to turn it on fell off inside the turtle after about a week of use.  I was the one pressing the button when it came off, and I wasn't being rough or using excessive force.  We had to shake the turtle to get the button out but couldn't re-fasten it easily.  For a few days we stuck a finger in the small hole where the button used to be to activate the turtle, but then the rubber sensor fell off as well.  With no way to turn the thing on, we threw it away.  My toddler was sooooo sad, but it was worthless to us.  Since this is overall a popular product, I suppose we just had bad luck.  I wouldn't buy another one, though

We bought this for our son after experiencing some dirty or too large public toilets.  
My husband tried to use it for the first time yesterday and could not get it to fit the toilet at a restaurant and there was no way he could lift my son on to it without it slipping.
I thought I would give it a try today when we were out for breakfast.  Typical toilet at Einstein's bagels.  
I had a hard time getting it to stay, lifted my son up and placed him on the seat.  He let out a horrible scream and I lifted him up and threw the seat cover to the floor.  
He was bleeding.
THE PRIMO FOLDING POTTY SEAT CUT HIM ON HIS BEHIND!!!!!!
This product does not fit on toilets, the handles are blocking where the legs should go and instead of protecting him, it hurt him.
We will just bring disinfecting wipes from now on.
DO NOT BUY THIS!!!

I bought this product because my little girl always wants to use the toilet.  We have a regular potty trainer that goes on our toilet at home and thought this would be similar.  It is not!  It has not fit on ANY public toilet we have tried and slips all over the place.  She doesn't want to use it, which leaves me with nothing!  I would not purchase this product

  We went through three of these before we finally gave up.  Our poor baby was crying and we didn't know cause it stopped working in the middle of the night.  I luckily am a light sleeper.  Also the static is bad especially if you have a cell phone any where near.  We bought a cheaper,  safety first brand and have not had any problems

While sometimes this works well, I'm frequently woken up in the middle of the night to static that wasn't there when I went to bed.  It doesn't matter what channel it's on.  I also get a random drumroll sound frequently. 

If you like being woken up in the middle of the night because your monitor is a piece of crap, then I highly recommend this

We bought this monitor about a year ago to replace the one we had gotten at a yard sale and it seemed to work great at first, however after about 2 months the 1st receiver, (it came with two), just suddenly stoped working! I thought maybe one of our family members got water on it or something because it was kept in the kitchen, but sure enough a few months later the other receiver that we kept in our bedroom just suddenly stoped working! There must be some kind of defect in the production of these things because as I can see from reading the other reviews that we're not the only family having problems. Save yourself the headache and purchase a different brand/model

The product claims to carry children up to 40 lbs. my daughter is only 27lbs. and it could not hold her. While it has all the pockets and looks like the higher end carriers it is not. After one day at the amusement park the straps started to strain and seperate fromt he carrier. I returned this item and got the Sherpani Rumba which has a wight limit of 70lbs. I love it. 
Also, the cross terrain claim to " Load balancing straps distributes weight off parent's shoulder and onto hips" it does not. I was in horrible pain after about an hour. in both my upper and lower back. I suggest you don't waste your money and go with the higher end products like Sherpani and  Kelty. 
This will work for a smaller child, but only if you can compfortably carry the weight. I did like the easily adjustable seat and back. I was able to adjust from my height to my husbands.

I never got to use this sheet. I pre-washed it and put it to dry on low heat as I've done with all the baby clothes. I later saw the label said to air dry, which seems ridiculous for something that'll be washed so often. Anyway, it shrunk and doesn't fit over the co-sleeper mattress. If you have time/space to air dry it, it's probably a fine product.

Baby Age sent me a funny pink feeding pillow with the same value of the crib set, refusing changing it to the crib set. I have to return it by Amazon A-Z Guarantee,wasting a lot of time.

I bought this for my son thinking that the pee guard would be okay.  My son pees over the top of this, plus it being on isn't to comfortable for an adult's back and having this also makes are toilet seat loose and we have to tighten the screws often.  The whole on it is also pretty small

I had a winter baby and I can't begin to imagine what I would have done without this item.  I have personally inspired 2 other new moms to purchase this already as well.  The absolute best thing is that you never have to put a coat on the child.  And what a time-saver that is if you are a woman on-the-go like myself.   

I was excited that right before I had my baby girl they came out with the new Limited version.  I have the Diva color for my little and I get a lot of compliments on the look and ease of use.

I disagree with others who thought it was difficult to adjust the item around the harness straps and that it was cheaply made.  I installed the sack and made the adjustment one-time.  The material allows weather and some liquids to just roll right off the fabric.    

I would consider this a must for any first-time moms (as I was) on their registry.  The price definitely a lot higher than I would like to see it, but still a must if you can afford to make the purchase.

I bought several versions of the Bundle Me only to find out today that they should not be used because they go under the baby and interfere with the way the safety straps fit! I am so frustrated by this! Why are they allowed to sell products that are not safe??? We took our car seat to the Katie Cares Safety Check today and they took all of the accessories off. We had a neck support cozy on the seat as well that they said was also unsafe. Save your money and buy a version that goes OVER the seat and baby, not under... Kidopotomus makes one.

We have switched bottles with my daughter more times than I would like to admit.  She's had gas and discomfort with all of them.  I decided to try Avent bottles...I bought twelve of them and at first they seemed to relieve some of the gas.  But they leak horribly.  Sometimes it's a few drops.  But most times it's like a continuous stream of formula.  

A couple of times I wasn't paying close enough attention to the bottle while feeding and formula ended up soaking my daughter's bib, her sleep sack, her onesie, and my shirt.  The entire bottle emptied all over us before I knew it...the leak was that fast!  I tried every suggestion given to me:  mixing the formula in a seperate container, mixing it in the bottles, and using sealing disks to mix in the bottle; heating before adding to the bottles, heating in the bottles;  wetting the nipples, not wetting the nipples;  making sure the bottle rim was properly inserted into the nipple ring, etc.  

I wrote a letter to Avent and called twice about this issue.  Each time, the customer service rep spoke down to me and said I must not have read and followed the directions (which I had).  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE EXPENSIVE, POORLY DESIGNED BOTTLES!!!  These are the worst on the market in my experience.

I heard lots about the Avent brand while pregnant and registered for all Avent bottles.  Boy am I glad that someone gave me Soothies and Parent's Choice Anti-colic bottles too!!  The nipples are way too tough and it was a constant fight to get my daughter to drink from them.  She loves the other two brands, and I love the Parent's choice because it truly does help with her swallowing air and the tube in the middle shows when the formula is too hot.  Don't waste time or money with Avent!

I have three kids, and for the third time, I am utterly dissapointed with Avent's product.  With each new child, we bought a fresh supply of bottles, hoping Avent had fixed this problem.  We really wanted these bottles to work, as they seem to be the most durable and stylish ones on the market, and our kids never had any problems with the nipples.  However, each time, we ended up having to switch to another brand.  

The leak is not just a spot here or there.  It is often a torrential downpour, leaking out the sides of the white cap.  I know many people who have had the same problem.

For as expensive as these bottles are, I would think Avent would take more pride in their product, fixing such simple things as a leak.  

Don't waste your money

When I learned I was expecting triplets, I bought a large inventory of these bottles which I thought were the best out there.  Boy, was I wrong!  These bottles leak, not just once in a while but with almost every feeding.  I am constantly "double checking" them in hopes they won't leak all over my babies.  I now cover my babies with a cloth diaper so that they don't get soaked when - surprise! - the bottle leaks all over them.  Yes, I've read the directions and no, I don't over tighten the bottles.  You can't take them with you for feedings on the go since they will leak all over your diaper bag or cooler bag.  They are especially leaky when I prepare bottles in advance and store them in the refrigerator.  There is something about the cold or condensation that affects the seal.  The bottle must be disassembled, the top wiped dry and then reassembled.  Lots of fun with three bottles - especially for 3 am feedings.  Even if I am doing something wrong, a bottle that requires this much precision in assembly not to leak is not a very good product.  If I hadn't bought so many, I'd throw them all away and get something else.  Take it from someone who is using these bottles three times as often - they are a waste of money and a source of constant aggravation

Good things: (1) Baby loves watching the hanging toys. (2) The nature sounds are very well done and very pleasant.

Bad things: (1) VERY troublesome to assemble. The supplied screws are a cheap metal and they are screwed into plastic threads. In the most critical support structure (the kickstand) I could not get all of the screws into their holes completely before the screws stripped out. But I did get it together well enough to use. However, I considered returning it to the store during assembly. (2) The vibration feature broke after about 1 month of use. (3) Baby cannot reach the toys, even at 3 months of age, and we have a very tall baby. (4) Toys are very easily removed from their "holes" so that you can't really move the chair without the toys falling out. (5) The rocker has a very big "footprint". It takes up about half of the surface area of our four-seat kitchen table

Shoppers beware:
The item itself is a great item but I have received the worst shipment ever from my online orders:
1-Even though the item is advertised in Amazon as new, I received an item which was previously used and apparently for a long long time. The rocker seat was dirty and smelled.
2-Even though the seller charges more than 9 dollars for shipping, they did not bother to put the manufacturer fragile box in a mailing box. Therefore the package arrived cut in several locations with some of the items bulging out.
3-Some of the accessories are missing and I can bet the previous owner forgot to return them

I purchased this seat because of the safety factor that Consumer Reports reported on.  In comparing the seat to Graco Snugride, however, I am very disappointed on the tough, very dense foam on the low back/sacral region of the seat.  The foam goes down to a certain point on baby's low back, and then disappears, leaving a dip for baby's buttocks.  Just imagine sitting in a recliner with support only down to the low-back region (with buttocks not supported) ...not comfortable.  I wonder how a baby's backside would stand up to a traumatic jolt in that seat...well, I'm not going to take any chances.   Baby Trend should have consulted a Physical Therapist (like me) before designing this seat.

We bought this car seat (and the snap 'n go) based on good reviews (not the ones listed here). It did not meet our expectations. I give it 2 stars just for the safety of it. Otherwise, I have a hard time finding positive things to say. It is way too heavy. Our baby was 7 lbs+ and from his early days, it was heavy to carry around. Now that he is almost 20 pounds at 5+ months, it is nearly impossible to carry him for any length of time. The adjustable strap often gets stuck and we really have to tug to make it work. On most grocery carts it is too big to have it face towards you as you shop. When you do clip it on to the cart, the front end is suspended in the air. I just put it sideways which is a pain. Also, the handle bar is built to be easier to carry...I don't agree. It is still awkward- I end up hooking it under my arm. Lastly, to put the handle bar up and down is very difficult. You have to squeeze the taps on both sides and really push hard to get it to release. I'm sorry that I don't have any others to recommend. I had hoped to like this and am just suffering until he doesn't need the support in the grocery cart---that is really the only reason I still use it

The noise the toy makes running is lounder than any of the music to sooth baby.  We were greatly disappointed

We loved this toy when my daughter received it for Christmas.  She loved to lay in her crib and look at it and recently even learned to turn it on by herself!  This morning I looked at the toy and noticed that the water compartment was almost empty!  The water drained out of the compartment it belongs in and back in to the part which contains the musical mechanisms and the battery connections!  It's not exactly fixable, so we will move on to another crib toy

We got this in lieu of another similar one because it was in stock, but lo and behold it only lasted a week. Our son lays on his back and kicks everything in his crib, so when he kicked this, the knob securing it to the crib through the strap broke off. Luckily the broken piece fell on the floor and not into his crib, where it could have posed a choking hazard! Pass on this and get a Fisher Price one - Ocean Wonders or the one we got, Flutterbye Dreams, which he loves

We received this toy as a gift when our son was born.  It was installed on our crib once and was removed once to replace the batteries.  When I went to put it back onto the crib, I noticed that the plastic straps that affix it to the crib were cracked and starting to break.  I need to stress that this toy was only affixed to the crib one time and my son never pulled on it or put stress on the straps at all.  Also, like other reviewers have stated, the company recommends removing it from the crib at 5 months of age - yet that's when my son started interacting with it, so it's a little age-inappropriate.

I contacted the company about the straps to see if there is an at-home repair kit or if they offer a replacement...I'll repost if I hear from them.

I bought the Baby Einstein Sea Crib toy based on its look.  I brought it home, put batteries in it and it worked for 5 minutes before it quit playing sounds.  I was also disappointed that the ocean sound only played for a few seconds.  I had thought it would play for 12 minutes like the music.  I took it back and purchased the Fisher Price aquarium and it is great.  It plays every sound for 10 minutes and seems more durable

I had purchased the Dr. Brown bottles after the birth of my boy/girl twins in hopes of helping my son with his gasiness.  They did help ease his suffering but he was also put on soy which seemed to help the most.  By this point, both babies had become attached to these bottles and wouldn't use anything else. 

At first I thought I must be doing something wrong for them to continually leak, and sometimes POUR out of the rim of the bottle. (I have a total of 4 kids and have been through lots of different types of bottles, none this bad!) We tried Everthing to stop the leaks - 
*using only all dry parts for each new bottle
*not heating or storing in the fridge with the valve and stem inside
*not overfilling

After an entire year of frustration with these leaking bottles I noticed that when my son would hold it by the nipple or squeeze the nipple, that milk would come pouring down the sides!  Finally, the answer to the leaks!!!  

Is truly a great idea and I hope they try to perfect it, but these have a MAJOR DESIGN FLAW - and babies drenched with formula in the middle of the night is no fun.  These items were meant for baby use, and for the price  it should help make babies' &amp; mom's life easier.

Stick with Avent or Playtex with liners.  Thank you &amp; Good Luck

We asked for 2 of these and got both. The material was itchy and scratchy and never got softer. It was very thin and you could see the pattern through the sheet. It was easy to put on mainly b/c it was a bit big. They ended up in the closet in no time

I recently purchased two of these sheets and ended up taking them right back. They say they're fitted but they aren't elastic so they're not that well fitted. They are paper thin. Apparently Graco hasn't put these on their pack n plays and observed the quality! I purchased the Koala portable sheets which were cheaper, thicker, and truly are fitted with elastic! Don't waste your money on these

We got 2 of these and had the same problem with both.  The cloth on this cover already had some snags on it when we took it out of the package.  After washing it as directed, it has gotten even worse.  It has strings hanging all over it.  It's a very useful item, but the quality of the fabric is terrible! A friend of mine had the same problem, and she recommends the Especially for Baby brand (less expensive and better quality)

I washed the cover for the first time and it didn't hold up.  The ends are frayed and there are even holes where the elastic band  attaches to the terry.  Also little pieces of the terry got all over everything else I washed with it.  I'm extremely disappointed with this product

I loved the gate. So when I moved to my new house and found that the doorways were wider than the gate, I needed the extension. It was well worth it. My daughter is always pulling on it and hanging on it, and it still stays very sturdy within the doorway. I am also happy that we got to re-use the hands free gate because I would have hated to fasten a gate right onto the wall and make holes in my wall. This gate was a great purchase

An OK gadget, but a large coffee cup with water heated in the microwave works just as well. It does not have an automatic shut off, so the water in the unit eventually evaporates leaving the exposed heating coil. Must unplug the unit after each use to prevent this

When your infant is crying because he's hungry and you're only thinking about how you want to be back in bed, you will not necessarily hear the very quiet "click" another reviewer mentioned unless you are right on top of this unit.  Did it already cycle through once?  Twice?  I don't know.  I never could catch it since it was in my kitchen and I was usually trying to soothe my child in the living room when the light went out.  Yes, it was in plain sight, but that doesnt mean I caught it at the right time.   
What I do know is that leaving the bottle in there, reagrdless of it being 4oz. or 8oz., makes the formula very HOT. Even if you have it on the proper setting according to the instructions.  Then you have to wait for it to cool down before feeding your now screaming hungry baby. 
This went in the trash.  The only reason I gave it two stars is because it did heat the bottle faster than if I waited for water to boil.  Otherwise, I just started giving my son formula made with room temperature water and had not one problem

I love the other sleep sacks, you can see my full review of them on their web pages. But this sack has different fabric which I really, really don't like. It isn't actually quilted. It is woven to look like it is. The material is such that it attracts hair and lint to it in the dryer and it catches in the fabric so it takes a bit of light tugging to get it off. It also catches on any hang nails or rough skin. When it is warm I use the cotton sleep sacks and when it is cold I use the fleece (polyester) ones. Great sacks, just annoying fabric with this one

I used this tub for my first born. This is small and holds very little water, therefore, the water gets cold fast! Also, there are holes where the tub folds up so the water spills out of the holes as the baby moves. It can be messy if you are giving your baby a bath on the floor as I did. 

Our baby would stick her foot and leg out of the tub because it's so small...when I used larger tub, that didn't happen.

One positive thing that I can say about this product is that it's compact...I kept it at my mother's house and it didn't take up much space.

I would recommend spending an extra $10 to $15 and buy a higher quality tub.

For our first baby, we were determined to stay away from the lure of cute but unnecessarily expensive baby items.  This was one of the few items we did not research and we purchased this tub thinking any tub would work.  We were wrong.

The tub is too slippery which causes his head to endlessly roll back and forth into the corners.  The slant of the tub is also meant for a larger baby which causes his head to dig into his chin which he hates.  Bathtime is about bonding, so after a month and a half of fighting, we ended up taking our baths together.  My son prefered the skin to skin contact anyways.   
The tub is also a poor fit for any oval sink bathroom, and the one time I put it in the kitchen sink I filled it with water and it buckled.  Never tried it again.  If you want to wash your baby in the sink, get a foam sponge or a bath support specifically made for newborns.  

Even for 12 dollars I would not buy this tub again.  Granted it might work for some, but if you have a fussy or even mildly fussy baby I would not recommend this tub.

This tub was great in the beginning - it fit perfectly in our kitchen sink and we were able to bathe our baby with no problems at all. It was great that she could sit in the warm water and not get cold while I was washing her, etc.

However, after using the tub about 10 times, it suddenly collapsed into the bottom of the sink with my baby inside. Basically, the top and bottom ends that fold up for storage just buckled. She wasn't hurt, but was very scared. Keep in mind that this problem started when my baby was 12 lbs - so I don't think her weight was an issue

At first I really liked these, until I realized that my baby just used about 100 liners in about 1 week. It's not easy to squeeze the air out. Since I keep track of how much our baby eats, how can I do that when the liner is all scrunched up! Not worth the money on the liners and there is plenty of air that gets into the liner even if once in a while you do manage to get the air out. I'm sorry I ever bought them

First off, the person who wrote about her ingenious husband who invented the trick of squeezing the air out before screwing the top on?  Yeah, I'd call him creative, but not the one who 'invented' that trick.  I had to giggle to myself and then post this publicly... myself and my whole group of friends used that trick.  Secondly, the liners are too expensive, and third, how in the world do you mix formula in these things?  They worked great for breastmilk, but the hassle of having to mix formula in a seperate container and then pour it into the liners was just too much for me at 3 am with a screaming kid.  Even waiting to warm it up under hot running water took too long.  Give me the regular bottles any day.  
PS- bisphenol-A... what about high fructose corn syrup, cargeenan (which is the sludge that comes from soybean processing and is put in nearly every food on the market as a preservative) and even - gasp- the probability that your kid might someday eat a bug that has eaten off a chemically-treated cornfield!  I'm all for protecting your kids but you can't save them from everything and there are much more harmful substances out there

Do not believe the manufactures claims that you don't need a jacket if you have this bunting.
We had a 7am Enfant bunting for our daughter for her first winter and loved it.  It had a hood (that could be unzipped) and completely covered her up and kept her toasty warm without any extra clothing. Now she has outgrown it and I bought one of these as a replacement.
There is no way by any stretch of anyones imagination that you can use this bunting without needing a coat and hat as well.  The zip only zips to about half way up the chest of my one year old.  Yes you could pull up the flap to cover her chest but she just pushes it down again since there is no way to keep it up!
It did keep her just about warm enough with a coat, hat and mittens at a temp of 35F, but I want something that you can use without a coat.

After much research I am returning this (after a single outing) and getting a Little Kazook instead (which zips all the way up and has a hood)

I looked at some other reviews and saw many people were having the same problem.  It's a great product for smaller children

This product is a good idea however:

1. The fill hole, is not large enough to fill the bottom of the dish      
   with hot tap water without getting water into the serving tray.

2. Can't be put in the Micro.

3. Extremely hard to open bottom compartment to clean.

4. Extremely hard to open and close ( I and my daughter have to use a 
   butter knife to pry open).

5. Not good for a grandmother's hands that has joint problems.

6. Doesn't keep food warm for very long.

Perhaps going back to the drawing board would help this product

Maybe in time I will figure this plate out, but I cannot get the suction to work and there were no directions with it as to how to take it apart, use the suction, clean it out. It may seem simple, but a harried mother needs these details! I am disappointed as it is utterly useless to me, at least as far as being a stay-put dish, which is why I purchased it.

We purchased 2 of these seats to give to the grandparents for when my son came to visit them. Right out of the box, the seat pad wouldn't stay on the seat and slides around during use. I figured I could live with that since it was just a cheap seat anyway. After only 5 or 6 uses however, the clip that holds the seat belt adjuster to the booster snapped while installing the seat into our second car a few days ago. 

I tried to contact Evenflo to report this problem, but they were completely unconcerned about the failure of their product. They told me that they only warranty the seat for 90 days from purchase (and you have to have proof of purchase). They did offer to send me out a replacement part, but under the circumstances, I don't feel comfortable using the seat at all, so I'll be destroying and disposing of it. I explained that we were thinking of replacing the seat with a different Evenflo model and asked if a discount coupon was available to reduce the cost of replacing the defective seat, but they told me that out of warranty it was no longer their problem. 

Thank goodness this part failed while installing the seat and not during a crash, or my son certainly would have been seriously injured. We haven't had any problems yet with the other seat, but I'll be replacing it anyway just to be safe. After their horrible customer service, I won't be buying another Evenflo ANYTHING ever again.

I've used the Diaper Dekor since the birth of my now 7-month-old daughter and I loved it to begin with. Very easy one-hand use--step on the pedal, drop the diaper through the flap, very easy to tie off a bag when it became full. In the beginning, it handled odors well too; even smelly diapers didn't cause problems. But as soon as I started feeding solid foods, things changed. It proved completely incapable of containing the ghastly stench of those diapers. My daughter's room is at the top of our stairs, and the stench didn't just fill the room, it flowed out her door and down the stairwell, so we were treated to a powerful whiff every time we walked upstairs. I took to leaving her window open and the fan on to air out the room during the day and emptying the pail before bedtime at night in order to prevent it from stinking up the house. That lasted a week -- I just bought a new pail (a Diaper Genie 2) and I hope that works better

We had the Diaper Dekor Plus and it seems that I'm the only reviewer here so far that has had a terrible problem with it having a bad smell.  The first couple of months weren't bad, but after about 3 months or so, it really started to smell bad.  This horrid smell only got worse with use as time went on.

We tried everything we could think of to get rid of the smell-letting it "air out" outside, cleaning it with bleach or some other cleaning solution, putting baking soda in the bottom of the liner and even leaving a small box of baking soda inside the can but outside the liner, letting it soak in a bathtub of soap and water...we even bought some scented disc type things (can be purchased at Babies R Us) that you can put in the bottom and it only made the smell worse.

We continued to use it, but frequently had to let it air out or spray it with Lysol or something.  Eventually we used it less and less, and we just threw it away when we moved to a new home a few weeks ago-we'd had it for almost 2 years.  We knew there was no way anyone else would want to use it with that smell and knowing they couldn't get rid of it.  It was a real shame because aside from the smell, it was a great product

After seeing the latest Consumer Reports article on infant car seats, I immediately replaced my Britax Companion with a Graco Snugfit. The Britax had previously been highly rated, but the latest test trashed it. We were surprised, becuase it is the first seat we have owned (on our 3rd kid), that really was rock solid snug once installed. I bought a Graco Snugfit, and I have nothing good to say about it. No matter how tight I got the straps attached to the LATCH in my 2006 Honda Odyssey, I could still flip the seat up and side to side with very little effort. For now, I'm sticking with the Britax

In our pursuit for ultimate baby items, the infant carseat topped our list. What's more important than the safety of your first child, especially in so unpredicatable a situation as driving? 

Our search led us to this Graco carseat, and we added it to our wish list and recieved it as a Christmas gift, just before our daughter's birth in January.

The seat is fairly attractive, but its good points stop there. 

It's a bear to install. Not because it's complicated, but rather because you need an extraordinarily strong man (or a woman, unlike myself certainly) to install the base. We ended up taking it to an inspector who spent about 5 minutes tugging on the belts with all his might, and then huffed and puffed and told us "That should be in there real good, now." We examined it, and asked why the seat was still able to flip up toward the back of the car, and he replied, "Oh they all do that, that's normal."
Unsure, but with the safety rating to back it, we continued to use it. 

Throughout her first 7 months it was a cumbersome piece of equipment. Lots of bumping and banging it about to get it into the car with the baby already in the seat (we have 3 4-door sedans, a 1992 Subaru Legacy, an 80-something Oldsmobile, and my mom's 2006 Saturn Ion. With the seat already in the car, it's a struggle to get the baby in without bumping her head or catching her legs on the sides at least once - for me. My husband simply can't put her in with the carseat already in the car. 

Not to mention that, the seat - while installed in the car - has never felt especially stable, with the exception of my mom's Ion, which has the latch system. Of course, the drawback of the Ion is that my 6'1" husband can barely fit into the front seat because the carseat is so large and cumbersome that he cannot move his seat back and so he is sort of smashed into the dashboard.

Then, in the past week the seat has begun to fall over while we're driving. Literally, go around a curve, look back, and her seat's at a 45 degree angle from the backseat of the car. My daughter is 8.5 months old still falls a bit below the weight and height limits for the seat. We've checked the belts that secure the seat, pulled with all our might, and the seat continues to malfuction. This is a safety issue if I've ever seen one. With enough force, she could end up directly on her side, say the force of a side impact in an accident. Upon closer inspection, I shouldn't be altogether shocked. The base of the seat is proportionately much smaller than the top where baby sits. Sort of like a wine glass, I suppose - so it's top heavy, and likely the heavier the load on top, the greater the likelihood it will topple at the slightest provocation.

Needless to say, we'll begin shopping for a new seat immediately. As for the Snugride, I would recommend parents think twice before purchasing it. I'd certainly never consider it for an older vehicle without the latch system, and I'd still take it for a trial run in a newer one that does have the latch system. In hindsight I wish I had shopped around a bit more.

I bought this mirror because my son hates to ride in the car.  I thought the lights and music would distract him.  After about 1 minute of hearing this annoying lady sing, I have decided that I would really rather hear my son cry.  It is far less irritating.  The remote is completely useless because you have to press the button on the mirror in order for the remote to work.  What genius engineered that?  Also, it is to heavy and it folds in the center after being in place for about 15 minutes.  Don't waste your money!!

I bought this product as I was going on a long trip.  I put the batteries in the mirror and it did not work.  I put the batteries in the remote and it still did not work.  All that would happen is that the little red light would flash and you couldn't even turn it off without taking out the batteries.  WASTE OF MONEY!

CONS
*WON'T STAY IN PLACE
I've tried several times to position this correctly and it always slips out of place (and baby is out of view) I even sent away for the extra tether thinking that was the problem but no luck.
*WHY A REMOTE?
Tell me what use the remote is when you have to press the on button which is located ON the mirror and then if you don't use the remote within five minutes to turn it on it automatically shuts off rendering the remote useless for the remainder of your car ride? 
*THE IRRITATING SONG 
too short and plays over and over and over (teeth gritting)
*LEARN WHAT?
I've also noticed in the teaching mode it doesn't light up the right item with what the voice is saying. My poor confused baby will now think a blue car is a boat and a yellow house is a car...

PROS
*Now I have $39.99 less to spend on snacks that will hinder me from losing those pregnancy pounds I gained..

These are a complete waste of money.  The nipples flow too fast for a newborn.  I tried using them many times during my return to work transition and my daughter choked and cried during each feeding.  She also swallowed so much air-I was burping her for what seemed hours.  The bottles are too expensive for just storage-you can purchase generic breastmilk storage bottles made by evenflow for $3.99...personally I like to use the storage bags laid flat in my freezer, they take up less space

Don't bother with these.  They are expensive for only 4 bottles and totally unnecessary.  It is much easier to buy storage bags.  If you are pumping full time, you will be storing alot more than 4 bottles at a time. I also found that I did not like these bottles for feeding because they do nothing to prevent air from entering baby's belly and the result is gas or worse, colic.
They also flow too fast for newborns

I had this when my daughter was first born. It worked OK but she seemed pretty curled up in it. When she was about 2 months old we were out walking and one of the buckles snapped-- luckily I had my hand under the sling and she did not fall out or anything. I was able to return the product, but I bought the Snugli carrier instead-- I would not recommend this or any other sling that has plastic buckles.

I bought this for my daughter while I was still pregnant, thinking that it would be helpful thru the first few months (as well as later) in terms of being able to keep up with my daily chores and my 2 1/2 y.o. son. It certainly wasn't cheap, so I assumed that it would be a good product, and appeared to be safe and comfortable for younger infants. Don't let the product description fool you! Just as it says in some of the other reviews, it is very possible for your child to fall when in this sling, because of it's crappy strap tightener. My daughter was a small newborn, only weighing 8lbs at nearly 2 months, which was the first time I tried using the sling. And even being that small, for the 2 minutes I had the sling on I could already tell that the strap was starting to loosen. (Definitely NOT safe!) Aside from that, this item is so big and bulky that I literally could not even see my daughter in it. I might as well have just put a duffel bag over my shoulder and plopped her into it. There wouldn't have been much difference between the two. I WOULD STRONGLY ADVISE THAT YOU DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! I want to get rid of mine, since it's brand new, but I threw away the box so I can't return it. And I absolutely cannot, in good concience, sell it to anyone else for their child. So, I have no choice but to just bite my tongue and throw the product in the trash. Don't make the same mistake I did!

This sling was VERY difficult to use I could never get it adjusted correctly and never figured out how to breastfeed in it without being obvious. I used this sling for about 6 weeks and it just about killed my shoulder and back. It was uncomfortable and not nearly enough padding in the shoulders. Plus you still had to carry a diaper bag and/or purse so that just added extra weight. Don't waste the money I would much rather have another front/back carrier they work so much better and are easier to use and feel a LOT safer. 

The only things I did like were the pockets on the strap to keep small things in like paci's, keys, money and cell.

I have three baby carriers. It seems eccessive but I never found one that really was doing it for me. I started with Gracco carrier and it turned out to be a nightmare everytime I had to put the baby inside. My son was crying while I was snapping all the 1001 snaps it has there but after that he was stopping crying even though he wasn't looking too confortable.

When he got older (5 mounths) we bought a backpack carrier. This is a really really a nice buy. We loved it and so did our son. The problem with it is that I wouldn't put a baby younger than 5 mounths inside. 

So when my other son was born we tried this new carrier. I think that's the best for newborns because they don't have to support any body part. More over, when the baby sleeps, he is in a nice position and they seem to like it (even though I though his head was in a weird angle ?!?!) As soon as the baby gets heavier (8 or 9 lbs) it's getting a bit uncomfortable mostly if you have I large breast as I do. It slips from its place so the head of the child doesn't stand on your shoulder anymore but on your lower chest (so when you have a large breast the baby's head is really really in a weird angle !). I think that it doesn't worth the price for the time you use it. Now that my younger son is 5 mounths, I don't use it anymore

I have owned my Diaper Dekor Plus for 25 months.  In 2005, I found glowing reports in the Wall Street Journal and most other places.  It definitely is easy to use and the refills do last quite awhile, BUT... the trapdoors have broken TWICE.  I contacted Regal Lager a year ago and they sent a free replacement.  That free replacement broke less than 6 months later.  You can't expect it to contain the smell when the trapdoors are always broken!  This week, I contacted Regal Lager again and they said a replacement is $10.  I loved this pail until the trapdoors broke.  Unfortunately, it looks like it is a common design flaw as I browse the reviews from the last year or so. I am an engineer and I don't know what to say, except I am really annoyed that the product is not more durable.  Regal Lager would do well to spend some time and money to engineer a more robust spring system, instead of relying on $10 replacement parts-especially since loyalty to diaper pails is so fickle!  Now I have to decide whether to spend $10 on another replacement, try to fix it myself, get a different pail or maybe none of the above.  At what point is enough, enough?

I've owned my Diaper Dekor Plus for just under 2 years.  At first, I thought it worked fine.  It was easy to deal with, and easy to empty.  The first liner that it came with lasted me 6 months (1 baby - using newborn diapers through size 2's).

However, the unit failed to control odors after about 9 months.  Since then I've had to hide it in various places of my home to keep the odor to a minimum.  Definitely not convenient.

The unit has one particularly fundamental flaw regarding odor control.  Unlike the Diaper Champ which allows you to deposit a diaper without opening the container and letting odors escape, Diaper Dekor has no such provision.  It has two "trap doors" that allow you to drop the diaper in easily, and then they are supposed to spring back into place.  Still, no matter how quickly you drop that diaper in, and let the top lid fall closed, strong odors inevitably escape.  Also, these "trap doors" are quite flimsy.  The hinge on one of them recently broke so that the door no longer springs back into its closed position, thereby contributing to the odor problem.  I inquired about a replacement from Regal Lager and they said I could purchase one for $10.  Instead I decided to purchase a new Diaper Champ, since I've pretty much had it with this thing.

Speaking of flimsy, there are two other flaws I've experienced.  Firstly, the plastic foot pedal has cracked and seems loose.  It still works, but I have to wonder for how much longer.

Also, the door on the bottom of the unit that enables you to cut off the bag and remove it does not close very tightly, once again contributing to a lack of odor control.  The door is only held shut by a small plastic latch, leaving a significant gap for odors to escape.

Overall, I have not been impressed with Diaper Dekor Plus.  However, contrary to what some people say regarding the liner refills, that actually was never one of my bigger complaints.  I did not find them cost-prohibitive at all, because you get 3 liners for $20 and I found that 3 liners will last me about 6 months of holding toddler-size diapers.  In the 1 year 9 months that I've owned this system, I've only had to purchase refills twice.  The only thing I didn't like about it was that I did find it inconvenient to have to purchase liners online (couldn't find any local store that carried them) and wait for them to be shipped to me, especially when there is no indication of when you will reach the end of your last liner.

Diaper Dekor is the only system I have used extensively, and I would not buy it again nor recommend it to anyone.  I'm hoping my Diaper Champ will serve me better

We bought this diaper pail when our newest baby arrived.  We had previously used a Diaper Genie, that we no longer had - it worked fine, but was expensive.  We decided to buy the Diaper Dekor because of the Odor Free Guarantee.  Don't buy it.  The guarantee or the pail!
It stinks up the whole house with just one or two diapers in it.  We have kept it in the garage, and also outside.  Not convenient.  Refills are expensive.  And worse yet - my one year old can get DIRTY DIAPERS out of it through the top - or get the bag through the door in the front!!! Who designed this thing???

I've bought this tub thinking that I can just fold it up and store it under the sink.  But that's not how it works.  It take many steps to fold and unfold it, one of them ivolves inflating the seat!  The mechanism for snapping it in place when it's unfolded looks like it would break if it was used a couple of times.  Also, the plastic inflatable seat smells like all of the plastic inflatable things, probably not very pleasant for a little baby.  I am returning this item

I read Dr. Karp's book and decided to buy a swaddling blanket.  After doing a lot of research and reading a ton of good reviews on this one, I decided not to spend the $30+shipping on the miracle blanket, but get this instead.  Boy, was that a bad decision.  We tried a few times, and my baby unswaddled herself within seconds!  Granted, we had a big and healthy baby, who was strong, so maybe if your baby is tiny and/or weaker than an average newborn for whatever reason, it might work nicely for a while, but otherwise, don't waste your time with this.  I ended up buying the miracle blanket, and that WORKED!  Do yourself a favor, spend the extra $20 and buy the miracle blanket.  I could have avoided many sleepless nights if I did that earlier

This product is nice at first but you'll find yourself time and time again replacing it just so you don't have to put anymore holes in your home.  I've bought 5 of them over 4 years.  We have an expanding family and this things keeps on breaking.  DO NOT BUY, buy something better and higher quality so that you won't have to replace in 6 months.  PLEASE LISTEN TO THIS REVIEW.  IT WILL SAVE YOU

We had better luck than some - the gate lasted about 2 years before the locking mechanism gave out. Called customer service, and they said it isn't a replaceable part. Too bad. It was easy enough to install, and worked well up until it didn't anymore. The click is pretty loud; we found ourselves trying to close it two-handed to avoid waking up the baby. Disappointed it didn't last as long as we needed a gate - but my daughter is only 2 1/2 and I still need a gate at the top of the stairs. I'l be replacing it with a different product, obviously

Like so many others have said, this was a great gate right up until it broke.  Each time the issue has been the lock freezing in place.  We are now purchasing our 5th one in 3 years, the previous 4 having broken after varying lengths of use.  Each time a gate has broken we've pondered what to do because we don't want to drill lots more holes for gates that might be equally disappointing, but we dare not go gateless with two toddlers and their not surprising interest in the stairs.  Argh!!!

Please spend your money on a different gate.  There are nice wooden stair gates out there that seem pricey at first, but after going through what we have gone through, I wish I would have gotten a different gate.  We have twin girls in a bi-level house.  A stair gate is a must.  The 90 day warranty is a joke, because naturally, each gate broke after 90 days.  Same problem with all four - the knob just wont turn.  I will say - when it worked, it was nice.  But read other reviews, and you will see the same problem over and over again.  Shame on me for buying it again.  It just broke this past Saturday, after six months of use.  I will contact the manufacturer, but as in the past, I'm sure I won't get anywhere.  If enough people complain, perhaps they will change the design.  Again, please look elsewhere

As with all other reviews, our gate worked well for a while then the latch broke as well.  There is no way to fix it.  The company did nothing to help us with the situation, except to suggest that we buy an whole new one.  No thanks!

I would encourage anyone who has purchased this gate to send your complaints to the company, as I am doing.  Though the company says they have made improvements to the product, the gates are still breaking and should be recalled.  Their representative told me there is no reason to recall the gates since it is not a safety issue, however, they advertise its use for the top of stairs!  I called The First Years, and they said to send your complaints to:

This gate only worked for 8 months and the latch broke!  The company would not replace it because they only offer a 90 day warranty.  They will not even let you buy a replacement part.  They want you to buy a entire new gate.  What a rip off!  Don't buy this gate, it is a piece of trash

The baby bjorn is a nice carrier. I received one for my baby shower. However, I hardly used it. I thought I would use it a lot but I found I hardly used it after the first 3 months cause my baby weighed too much. Before that, the many straps made me afraid I was going to drop the baby. But probably the same problem for other carriers. I was really surprised by how little I used it, since I really wanted to carry my bab

I wouldn't let my dog sleep on these sheets.  They are of the worst quality imaginable.   We took ours back and purchased plain ole porta crib sheets and they fit PERFECTLY.  I recommend the Koala Baby name brand porta rib sheet.  They are available at BRU and have elastic all the way around, making for a snug fit.  And the quality is 1000 times improved over the PNP sheets

don't buy this sheet!!  it is not much thicker than a piece of tissue paper!  spit up would go right through it.

i have a much better solution for you--buy a couple of sheet savers to use in your pack-n-play.  they are a couple of $$ less and are sold as "especially for baby"(which is B-R-US house brand).  they are great.  i use them for both my son's crib and for the pack n play. they come in a number of colors so you should be able to match them to just about any pattern

The swing was easy to install and I did not need extra tools or help.  Unfortunately the tree branch was not exactly horizontal and so it was difficult to make the swing horizontal.  It was even enough, however, and I put my daughter in.  The swing was tilting a little far forward but I could not adjust it.  The worst part was getting her out.  The tray was near IMPOSSIBLE to undo from its locked position.  I guess I did not need to worry about her falling out, I was just wondering if I would be able to get her out at all.  I'll be donating the swing

We received this product off of our baby registry a couple of months before our due date and never used it until a week before the delivery. It worked the first time, but never again! I repeat we used it one time and then it stopped working, it just would not turn on!!!!! I asked the retailer for store credit but it was after their return period. I then sent a email to The First Years explaining the situation and never received a reply. Lousy product!

I bought this right before my daughter was born and have used it every day since she was born 4 months ago. A week ago it just stopped working. I really liked this steamer and it had served me well but now was just not turning on anymore. So I went out and bought the exact same steamer. I used it for 2 days and then on the third day, yesterday, it wouldn't turn on anymore. I'm taking it back today and getting something else

We too had problems with turning the sterilizer on.  The unit would not turn on when the lever was pressed, but several presses got it to work a couple of times.  After about 6 uses it died completely.   Not sure what the hard part about making a hotplate that is switched on by depressing a lever (like an electric kettle) is exactly, but these guys found it.

This unit also left a LOT of condensation in the stuff we sterilized

I had purchased this sterilizer based on a recommendation from a friend.  After just a few uses, the steamer stopped working.  When the lever to turn the steamer on was pushed, it just wouldn't turn on any more.  I contacted the First Years manufacturer, and to say the least, they did have excellent customer service.  They had no problem replacing the unit.  Upon receiving the second unit, I used the steamer once.  And because the steamer couldn't hold every thing on the first run I had to run it twice in a row.  To my disappointment, I pressed the lever and again it did not work.  Frustratingly, I pushed the lever several times and then the light finally came on.  Unless you cool it for about a half hour or more, this is how my unit operated.  I'm sure that not every one's experience is the same but this was how mine was.  I definitely would caution buyers on the product - only because this problem occured twice with the units that I have used.

I accidentally ordered this one instead of the Kolcraft Universal carrier, since they are both called the Universal carrier.  This car seat carrier is over-engineered with too many moving parts that are completely unnecessary.  Rather than returning it, my husband wanted to eat the $59.99 plus shipping by beating it up with a baseball hat.  We went out and purchased the Kolcraft Universal carrier-- it is much simpler, easier to fold, and has a large, functional basket underneath the car seat.

   We tried these after getting one of the portable mats that didn't work out.  This item too didn't work for us.  It won't stick it there is a table cloth.  Then 9 time out of 10 when we would get it stuck our daughter would pull it up with one hand!  It really ended up being more trouble than it was worth.

We started carrying a package of cleaning wipes in her bag...we wipe down her part of the table really well and let her have at it.  At 14 months she doesn't really make too much of a mess and if she does we just had an extra couple of bucks for a tip and apologize for the mess on the way out.

I wanted something thick and soft so my baby couldn't feel the plastic under his sheet. This one is so thin you can almost see through it. There is hardly any quilting. Another down side is you have to take the mattress completly out of the crib to put it on. It is a safe fit, and washes well. I ment to give it 3 stars

I was happy when this product arrived. It arrived in great time. I like the fact that it runs on a 9v battery and has the option of using two head sets. It states that it should be used in the last trimester, I am now 7 months pregnant and it still wont pick up my babys heart beat. I have even went to my appointmets with it thinking I am using it wrong. It will pick up my heart beat, but not the babys. I can't say it doesnt work because every woman is diffrent but it hasnt worked for me and as I mentioned it says to use it in your LAST trimester. The greatest thing about this is the cd's I play them for the baby every now and then

I ordered this item. I have bought directly from Baby Universe before, but now I've had several problems. I ended up cancelling this order because after I inquired to Baby Universe, I was told that the item was backordered.  They didn't know when it would be available. I also ordered a JJ Cole Bundle Me Lite from them.  It arrived fairly quickly, but was slashed through by a box cutter. I've been trying to get it exchanged, but their customer service is  lacking.  I won't exchange it and am trying to just get a return done now.  I'm not so sure that I would buy from this company.  They seem to be slipping - perhaps they can't quite handle the amount of business they are getting.  Disappointing. Just got an RA number for the item, but it has to be shipped back to JJ Cole and who knows when I'll get the item shipped to me.  They don't even give you the address to ship the returned item to.  Won't let me do a return.  This is a bad way to run a business

My experience has been similar to that of other reviewers. The one movable positioner secures very loosely with a small piece of velcro. My two week old daughter managed to slide down in between the positioners and had her face against one of them when I checked her in the middle of the night. Honestly, the only way a baby would stay on this thing is if they didn't move their arms... so perhaps the designers had no children of their own

My baby slid both down and off the side of this.  I thought it would be a good positioner because it was elevated, but instead the right bumper which is detachable does not securely fasten onto the base, rather it acted as a swivel and I found that my baby had her head hanging off the side of the positioner.  I am involved in a SIDS research study and this product alarms me!  She could have suffocated!  I am trying to contact the company to report this item...please do not buy

I had been told that these were wonderful, to keep your baby safe while sleeping on his side or back. But my little man slides down to where his face is between the foam sides. This worries me more than if he were to sleep on his stomach

I thought this would be a great way to keep my newborn son's head elevated while helping him feel snug and secure when he slept.  The first night we used it, my husband went in to check on him and he had wiggled his way down so that his head was right between the side supports.  He was horrified that our son could have suffocated.  This was after I had made sure our son was snug between the supports and they sat under his armpits.

I suppose the sleep positioner would work if your baby didn't move at all

I need something that I can use on top of a regular dresser,  but this one I don't particularly feel safe to use because it has velcro-on sides, 6 pieces that wouldn't stay in place when the baby tries to roll on his side. Also it has a fold line in the center that is not very comfortable for babies back, cushion kinda sinks in that area. The diaper cloth cover that came with it is made of cheap looking dirty white fabric.  It looks used even when its not. Which also does not fit snugly in the pad.  The belt looks flimsy and generally useless, especially when the velcro-on sides of the pad wiggles around and unstable.  I purchased another changing pad by Childkraft. It is way better than this one,  just one solid well made piece and so much stable for over the dresser purpose

This wipes warmer dries out the upper wipes overnight.  The screws in the upper lid rusted after a few weeks.  The rust dripped down into the wipes container and contaminated the wipes on the bottom. I have another wipe warmer by Dex that doesn't seem to dry out the wipes and I have never seen rust

I am an adoptive mom that was told that this pump was hospital grade and it has not helped at all, therefore I would not reccomend it for those that are trying to induce lactation. I liked the concept of this item and it was comfy. I had this pump for a year and had to return it to the manucaturer 3 times because the pump body stopped working. I would not recomend this pump, at least not to adoptive mothers. The customer service was awesome though!!! They were understanding and helpful. I eventually ended up getting a refund and then buying a medela.

IMPORTANT: Find a mobile with the option of it working, while being silent w/out music.

I thought this mobile was great for the first 5 minutes, but then I quickly realized, I couldn't get the thing to shut up- darn it- they didn't put that option on it! How can this be? It is a $40+  dollar mobile. My baby just wanted to see it go, but the music, and sliding beads put him over the edge. This mobile is too loud, and the sliding beads are loud as well. It stimulates baby too much. Even after covering it up and arranging it under the bumper pad- it was still too loud.


The motion is actually quite hypnotizing and great, but "Tiny Love" RUINED it by not putting a "silent running feature button" on it.  I'd pay $60 for it if it would just be quiet!!!


If this mobile worked without sound it would be wonderful. As it is now, I can't use it that much- only when baby is at his happiest. Even then, the mobile wears him out- and ruins his happy state, because it is too loud.

I think I shall pry it open and try to break the speaker.  I am serious.

I rated it with one star, because I can only use it when my baby is at his most rested and happiest state. If he is the least bit tired, it overstimulates him and makes him cry.

I have the Safari TT Dbl jogger from In Step and  I bought this shade because the shade on the stroller is non-existent.  

I have seen this product work well on single strollers, but it keeps blowing up and back from my canopy with the slighest of breezes, so it is not doing such a great job of keeping the sun off my kid's faces.

I've used a binder clip to keep it in place, but it still blows back more than I think it should..

This was the WORST sunshade ever!!!  Don't waste your money.  It is so flimsy that it offers no sun protection at all.  We used it on our double jogger stroller but it just flopped down into the faces of our babies.   I do not recommend this product.  I only gave it a one star because zero star was not an option

I just bought the Dora folding potty seat today at Walmart.  It doesn't cover the entire toilet seat.  It starts at the front of the toilet, and doesn't go all the way to the back.  The result is that there is no support in the back.  My daughter is 3 yrs, 4 months, and this seat is much too weak for her.  Any movement she makes causes the potty seat to sink in the back.  I'm afraid that if we use it, it will soon break and she'll fall in.  She definitely can't sit back, or even sit straight up because it sinks so much.  I'm returning it and I'm going to look for something else

Before purchasing this item, please check with your safety services division in your state regarding the use of this product with carseats.  I purchased this item with the hopes of keeping my newborn warm - but after I received it I was told by the Director of Safety Services in our state that these items compromise the integrity of the belts in the carseats.  I also had a very hard time tightening the belts in the carseat because the openings for the belts did not line up well. Instead, I returned it and purchased a Kiddopotamus, which is shearling-lined and zips but fits OVER the carseat.  The Bundle-Me item is perfect for strollers, but NOT for use with a carseat.  While I want to keep my baby warm, I think it is MUCh more important that she be safe and secure in her seat

Had to return this item.  It was way too small.  Forewarned when you order that it won't fit an average baby up to six months.  I would say it would fit up to 6 weeks at most!!  It is very cute and would be a great addition to a Bundleme (cover), but the company needs to reanalyze their sizing.  More disappointing was having to pay shipping return on a $9 item.

This seemed like a great idea but it doesn't work very well for cloth diaper users, like me. I use the top shelf for the wipes warmer and the side pockets for grooming items such as a brush and cotton swabs. However, since my cloth diapers won't fit into the diaper organizer, I'm not sure what to put there. Because of this, there is a lot of wasted space. 
  
 I would not recommend this product if you use cloth diapers

Monitor itself works fine -- but not if you plan on using the AC adapter.....

Fisher Price customer service recommends that the AC adapter should not be plugged into the reciever for more than 13 hours at a time or the rechargeable battery and/or unit will be damaged.  In my mind that makes the product useless if you intend on using the AC adapter -- you'll have to remember to unplug it every morning or risk wrecking the thing! (the fisher price rep actually told me I'd "fry it").

This monitor interferes with our cordless phones on all channels - a shrill noise emits when the phone rings or when you talk on it. ALso, it beeps out of range even when at distances much less than the stated 800 feet (- from our daughter's bedroom to the kitchen). I would definitely not recommend this product, and had I not lost the receipt, I would have returned it

$52.00 less weighted down by cash, and I was on my way with what was the most expensive non-video monitor available at the local Target. Surely being the most ridiculously expensive with all the highlighted bubbles beside features like "clear reception" and "no interference" I would be able to hear the baby's every move from every household location and beyond. 

We hooked it up in short order, turned it on, and *SCREEEECH*. Apparently a volume level that might permit us to hear the baby one room away would also cause some sort of massive interference between monitor and reciever. We tried shutting that monitor off, and plugging the second in the kitchen outlet - the entire length of the house away. No screeching, but it sounded like someone speaking from inside a tin can. Totally distorted, useless. You couldn't tell if the baby was banging on her crib bars or if someone was moving heavy machinery about in her bedroom. 

We've packed it carefully back into the box, and are hoping Target will take it back without a fight. Needless to say, I'd steer clear of this one. Our $20 Safety First monitor far surpasses this one - even on its last leg

I was excited to find a canopy for my daughters car seat to get the sun out of her eyes.  The ad said "universal fit".  Well, it fit, but second size up  car seats are taller and kind of lean back.  When you attach the canopy, it doesent pull forward enough to block any sun.  A hat better serves my child then this aparatus.  It now sits in the garage with all the other failed  baby devices

I bought this potty because I thought it was SOOOO cute, looking like a real toilet with the toilet paper roll and everything!  I still think it's cute, but just like many other reviewers say, all the music and talking and sounds are WAY too distracting to be able to actually learn potty training.  And, like other reviewers say, the sensor is NOT accurate, so it's always saying the child went potty when they didn't.  Very confusing for a child who's trying to learn to really "go" in the potty.

We're currently potty training our daughter, and we have three training potties -- this one, an older one that has a soft seat, and one that fits into the ring of the big toilet -- and this potty is the last one my daughter will pick when it's "potty time."  When we first got it she had a blast with it, using it as a toy and nothing more.  Now that the newness has worn off, she shows very little interest in it.  

If I had it to do over, I would have given her this potty without the batteries in it and without her even knowing it had the capability to make all the sounds.  

Here's a suggestion:  Don't put in the batteries until your child has mastered potty training.  Then, as a reward for his/her accomplishment, put batteries in and show your child what the potty can do.  With the training part out of the way, the sounds won't be such a distraction anymore

We bought this thinking our son would love the neaty gadgets and sounds...

We had several major issues with it.

1)  The pee guard.  It doesn't really latch on and STAY on.  Our son was irritated with the pee guard we he was first learning and kept ripping it off the seat then throwing it accross the room.  As luck would have it, when I would go retrieve the item, he would pee and since there was no guard, the pee would go everywhere BUT in the seat/ pot.   

To resolve this I had to use special adhesive for plastics (super glue didn't work AT ALL) which took 24 hours to set which interuppted our potty training.  It also turned part of the seat yellow which made it look dirty even when it was not.  But I had no choice- the guard HAD to stay on.

2) The sensors were too sensitive and would go off even when he did nothing.  He could just sdjust his position in the seat and it would tell him he did a great job going potty even though he never went.

3) The sounds and gadgets were TOO distracting.  He wanted to play with them and would turn around in the seat and this would sometimes be when he was about to pee and it would end up all over me/ the floor/ whatever was nearby.  I finally just took the batteries out and told him it was broken.

4) When he was ready to use the actual potty, we took it apart per direction and placed it on top of one of our toilet seats.  Everytime he pees I have to hold down his "bits" because the seat does not go all the way down to make a seal between the potty seat and the toilet seat, thus it leaks out from under the potty seat onto the toilet seat and then down the front of the toilet and onto his pants/ underware/ etc.  The pee guard is useless for this feature. Sometimes even when I do hold his stuff down, if he wiggles or moves, then he is not in position... There is only one position he can be in or it will go all over the seat and down the toilet and onto his clothes.

It was the most expensive toilet seat available at the store.  We thought we would be getting a top quality seat from begining to end of our son's potty training experience.  The price is what motivated me to try and make it work for us.  Finally, I threw the darned thing in the garbage and just got a circo toilet seat with a pee guard for the toilets.  It was the least expensive toilet adapter and it turned out to be the best.

If we have another child, I am going to get the basic toilet seat/ no frills and the inexpensive toilet adapter.  Both together were a fraction of what we paid for this seat and would be a million times less aggrevating.

DON'T waste your money

I bought this sling when my son was 8 months old and 19 pounds. He hated this carrier because he couldn't turn around and see the world. I hated this carrier because the rigid straps cut into my hips and shoulder every time he tried to move. The seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly (I tried numerous positions. There isn't a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable) and also said to tighten the straps so the baby couldn't move around. I did all of these things and still found it very uncomfortable to wear. The seller was helpful and the product arrived promptly, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. There is a $5 return charge.

I wish I could give this stroller 0 stars because it doesn't even deserve the one I gave it. It's a light stroller..there...the only plus. Where do I start...how about how after using it for one week the wheel fell off and they wanted to charge me shipping to replace it because I didn't have a reciept ( it was shower gift) After arguing with their lack- luster service team and proving with a birth ceritficate that my daughter was only a week old and that is as long as I had been using it, they shipped a new wheel free of charge...Fast forward to our vacation in Hawaii. The sun shade is non existent and I had to use a light blanket draped over the hood to protect my baby from the sun. The steering stinks, I have spilled drinks all over me and my baby because the cup holder moves AND doesn't hold anything but a small water bottle. The basket is hard to get to and holds nothing easily because it is so awkward. My husband and I went on a hike and came to the end of the path that wasn't paved. He asked me, "Are you worried about leaving the stroller so we can continue on the sand?" I replied "PLEASE....I hope someone takes this piece of @8!!8#!!!" End of story...I wouldn't invest in the Pliko P3 either. Don't get me started in the Peg Perego car seat either...JUNK!!

I bought this stroller from my daughter, thinking we could transition into it around 6 months.  She hated it.  The stroller lacked back support and she would slide down in the seat.  She would cry within five minutes of riding in the stroller.  After several months of use, the wheel fell off.  Also, the stroller is hard to stear.  You need both arms on the stroller to push.  If you try to guide it with one hand then it goes in another direction.  Even now that she is 16 months old and able to support her own body, she prefers other strollers.  I bought a cheap stroller from Wal-Mart and have been ten times more satisfied.  This stroller was recommended by my brother who has twins and uses the Aria tandam, which I assume is better.  I would not recommend it to another consumer

We purchased this stroller because of the weight (10lbs) ease of lifting it/out of the car. Two weeks after purchasing the stroller we noticed that the stitching on the sun shade was already coming apart. The shade is barely big enough to shield anything, let alone provide protection for the child. We received a replacement cover, but was advised that this would be a one time replacement. The tiny cup holder that was not big enough to hold a bottle has already broken off. Our 8 mo. old is 17 lbs. and the stroller is very difficult to maneuver. For straight paths, great. If you have to take a turn or change direction quickly, do NOT plan on having the stroller transition with your directional shift. The front wheels get stuck and you have to kick them back forward or the stroller will not steer correctly when you are going straight. Having had a Pliko previously for my 4 yr old, we thought we could trust the name of Peg Perego. Unless you are seeking a light weight stroller that does not maneuver well, we woud not recommend this stroller to anyone.

I bought this stroller last year when it went on sale at a local story.  Luckily it was a floor model so it was even further discounted.  I bought it because it was lightweight, had a front tray, adult drink holder and was in a very stylish orange color.  I was looking for a stroller with all the features of my full size Gracco but light weight and smaller to put in my trunk.  Well, after a couple weeks, I changed back to my umbrella stroller and use my Graco for longer trips.  Here are the negatives I experienced with the Peg Prego Aria:
- Poor steering.  Can not handle quick turns.
- Sun shade only works for direct overhead sun.
- 5 point harness is poorly designed.  The plastic hook is always coming undone and gets tangled.
- My drink holder broke.
- Overpriced for features and quality.
My positives are:
- Nice looking
- Easy to fold
- Lightweight
I keep this stroller in our attic now as an extra stroller for when we have company.  Thankfully it folds up small and does not take up too much room!  I would not buy a Peg Prego again

When we first received this stroller, we loved it!  It handled well--very smooth, easy turns, could be directed with one hand.  My one complaint was that the handle was too short for someone with longer legs.  But as we started using it more and more, we found it was not very "user-friendly."  For one, the way it opened was not intuitive.  We had to push it out and forward while pulling up on levers on each side of the handle bar. Forget trying to do this while holding a baby.  Also, the canopy was too small and doesn't meet the baby carrier canopy when used as a travel system.  As a result, to keep the sun off baby, we needed an extra blanket.  These were minor inconveniences, but the real trouble started when my son outgrew the baby carrier and began riding in the stroller solo.  We quickly realized how stupidly designed the harness straps were.  They simply slid into a clip on the back support, so my active son could easily move forward and unclip the straps.  He was still held in the harness, but he was able to move about a little too freely and could easily lean over or forward to grab the wheels.  Too, after about a year and a half of daily use, the handling deteriorated.  The wheels stick when climbing hills and when turning and I constantly have to backtrack to get them realigned.

Somehow we ended up with no less than three strollers: a nice Zooper 3-wheel outdoors stroller, a MacLaren umbrella stroller, and in the middle this red Peg Perego Aria stroller. We have had nothing but bad news with this Aria stroller. What a clunker! As an Italian, I am ashamed to say this confirms to me the stereotype that they can make nothing that works but everything looks fabulous. I am only being slightly facetious. This stroller is very sleek and stylish, and light-weight, but that is where it all ends. 

The biggest flaw is the poor handling/wheels. Pushing and steering is a constant battle. Sometimes it just doesn't want to go. I have really tried to inspect where the problem is, and it does not look like the wheels stick. Rather, the whole body seems to flex too much when you push the stroller. Just gently rock the stroller side to side and you can see what I mean. Other nits include the Aria stickers coming loose and eventually needing to be torn off, and the baby's cup holder being both too shallow and too easily removable.  But the biggest problem is the handling --- it is not pleasant and we never use it anymore.

I got so excited when I saw this tummy-time mat.  My enthusiasm was hedged when I read that the water pouch needed to be EMPTIED DAILY.  If had known that little detail, I would not have registered for this mat.  I must also confer that the neat little toys do stick together - bummer.  Honestly, now I am skeptical of any "tummy time" mat.  I think my boys prefer a brightly colored, patterned blanket, toys within reach, and lots of parent encouragement to stimulate their tummy time needs.  Better off spending the money elsewhere

I was initially very happy with this product.  We purchased it to transition our 2-year-old to a double bed.  However, the plastic hinge bracket broke after several months of use.  Since I liked the product, I thought maybe I didn't have it adjusted correctly and bought a second one.  It, too, broke; so I'm now looking for a sturdier alternative

I bought this for my son, who was just over 2 years old at the time.  Within about 9 or 10 months, the railing broke at the plastic hinge.  Obviously, since this is major stress point for the product, it cannot be fixed with just some heavy duty glue.  I was disappointed that this railing did not last longer

My neighbor had the Nojo and liked it so I was going to get one too. I tried hers, but I couldn't get it tight enough so my baby hung down too low which didn't seem safe and hurt my back. I thought I could order a different size, but found it only comes in one size. I then read all the reviews here and followed someone's advice and ordered a from babymoon slings. It fit me better (I'm petite) and was a lot easier to use (and prettier!). I think it makes a big difference to get a sling that's not bulky and comes in sizes - I don't get why they use so much padding in the nojo, it makes it really hard to use with a newborn compared to other slings.

I registered for this sling, and was thrilled when I received it as a shower gift. I couldn't wait to use it. When my son was about 3 weeks old, I tried to put him in it. We both instantly hated it. Its far too bulky to use with an infant, and it doesn't adjust small enough to fit my frame (I'm 5'6&amp;quot; and FAR from skinny). I kept it, thinking that my son would eventually fit in it, and perhaps as he got bigger I'd be able to wear it. WRONG. I wish I'd brought it back when I could still return it. My son is now 11 months old and we still can't use this sling. There's no way he can sit in it securely. He hates being held but can't walk yet so I was really hoping we could use this, but it still doesn't fit me, and my 24 pound son isn't held safely in it. He can wiggle his way out in less than 3 seconds. I'm expecting again, and hoping I can find something much better than this for this baby

There are so many other sling out there.  Don't waste your timeor money on this.  I hated the padding as it was bulky constricting and hot.  It was also impossible to adjust.  I got a couple of slings from www.equanimitybaby.com and one from www.peppermint.com and love these. Bottom line, check out the other options, this one is a waste of $$$

This is by far the worst sling I have ever tried!  The padding is bulky and hot.  It is impossible to adjust.  Total waste of money.  I bought a pouch from www.equanimitybaby.com and it was perfect! easy to use and very comfy.  The bottom line is there are many other options out here besides this peice of junk.   If you can't use this sling, its not you, its the sling

I think the idea behind the sling is great but it is not for every baby.  Everytime our son is put in this he crys or screams.  He is an easy going fellow but he hasn't liked being held to closely.  He wants his freedom and this doesn't give much freedom to a newborn.  Also, the &amp;quot;training&amp;quot; video is more of a promotional advertisement.  I had to go to the web site to get more information about how to use it

A friend gave this to me for my 6 month old daughter - the walker itself is wonderful, but the light and sound feature is just the worst - as others have said, it dies after about 2 months, and the battery is non-replacable. My daughter loved the sounds and now they just die and warble and I can't stand it! If you buy it, don't get it for the music/lights - they will let you down

I would have given this walker 5 stars the first couple of weeks.  The walker seemed great for the price, it was easy to maneuver and the baby loved it. Unfortunately, the design is terrible on the Sounds N'Lights feature.  It began fading out before the baby had time to become bored with it.  After much frustration trying to get "to" the battery compartment to replace it, we discovered it is not designed for replacement at all.  The internal battery is soldered in place.  Once it loses it's original charge, you are left with a dismal fading off of the sound and a potentially unhappy baby

If you research the toxic gas theory for crib death (which has been around for 15? years) you will see that this item can produce toxic nerve gases just like crib mattresses can. This product is not safe at all, no matter what they call it. Get a BabeSafe mattress cover to prevent toxic nerve gases from getting to your baby, and use only 100% cotton on top of that (between your baby and the mattress cover). Do not use polyester fleece or acrylic blankets or comforters and use 100% cotton blankets. Run from this product

The "Breathe Safe Padded Sheet" also left a mesh imprint on my baby's face. Placing a sheet over the Breathe safe pad defeats the purpose of lessening the current routine:
1) Untying bumper guard &amp; moving it out of the way
2) Struggling to "pull" out heavy mattress from crib
3) Removing &amp; washing sheet &amp; mattress pad
4) Wiping off mattress with soap &amp; water
5) Replacing sheet &amp; mattress pad
6) Returning heavy mattress to crib
7) Re-arranging dust ruffle
8) Re-tying bumper guard
Other than that, it seemed like a good idea. Searching for a better product.

Got this for my then newborn and thought it was a life saver until she started soiling it months later and then realized it isn't all that easy to get on and off.  With 8 snap on straps, it's a hassle to move the crib away from the wall and snap on/off on a regular basis.  I realized changing the crib sheet was just easier.  With crib mattresses being vinyl covered, why do we need waterproof sheets anyway.  I just slip off her fitted sheet and wipe up any wetness off the vinyl - so simple.  Sometimes good marketing convinces us that we need useless products.  By the way, two of the straps broke off in the wash, thank God it was after I realized I didn't need this anyway

When we first bought our baby's mattress, it did not have any unusual odors at all. We washed the Ultimate Mattress Pad before using it, but after a short time, we began to smell an odor on the mattress that became stronger with time. We finally replaced the mattress and once again had a mattress that was stench-free. By this time we had purchased an organic mattress pad as well. Use of the organic did not cause any problem, but since we had not yet put two and two together (not smart), we put the Ultimate Mattress Pad on our new mattress just one time and sure enough it began to smell. We now use only organic mattress pads and only one side of the mattress. The side that never came in contact with the Ultimate Mattress Pad smells just fine, but the side that we did use it on has a stench you don't want your baby sleeping on. I guess you need to make sure you put a sheet between the mattress pad and the crib. We actually put the sheet over the mattress pad because the surface seemed so rough that we didn't want our little boy sleeping directly on it. When we did try that, he woke up with a mesh-imprinted face

This worked great for a couple months.  Then the monkey that moves up and down started making a loud clicking noise.  The gears must be slipping.  My poor baby gets really excited to kick the parrot to make the monkey move, then gets scared at the loud clicking/popping noise and starts crying.  Really sad

This is a very cute bouncer chair.  However, I feel it was poorly designed.  It sets the baby almost laying down so it is difficult to play with the toys.  In addition, our baby has acid reflux and it was not a good chair for him because it sets him back too far.  We had to find one that set more upright

These bottle leak, they're expensive... and you can't mix formula in them unless you buy the special tops or it sprays formula all over!  Don't waist you're money - they're a pain to wash, too many pieces, and they just plain leak.  After 9 months of using them I'm ready to toss all 30 of my bottles and start over with something else.  Plus, even with the top on, if they fall over in your diaper bag the whole bottle will leak all over everything

I bought this hoping it would help my newborn calm down or sleep the same way a hair dryer or vacuum cleaner work so well.  This thing doesn't have a white noise sound but I thought maybe the Womb sound might work. However the volume was not even close to loud enough to compare to a hair dryer.  It's just become a toy for my older child who likes to play with the other sounds.

The AC adaptor and sound selections are great, but the sound is way too low, even on the highest level. I foolishly bought this, knowing that others thought it was too low...but it really is SO LOW you can't hear it 4 feet away. Turned out to be a 20 buck paperweight for me.

My 8 1/2 mo. granddaughter got her leg stuck between the bars in the middle of the night.  I've got the correct bumper pads, etc. but babies do move.  She had bruises on her ankle and was throwing up she was so upset.  I've only had the crib 1 week, she's gotten her leg stuck 2 times.  We caught it within minutes and it frightens me to think that she could have gone longer.

Very poor construction and does not "fit most sleigh cribs" as advertised on the box.  This company should be ashamed of themselves for charging $70 for this product.  The concept is a good idea and could be so much better, but this company fails in execution.  "Tots in Mind" definately has something in mind, however it is not your Tots.  Buyer beware

Bought this crib tent after reading all the "fine print" about returns.  Besides, toilet seats etc. which Allegro Medical does not allow for returns due to hygenic reasons, Allegro Medical made it appear that you can make returns within 30 days.  Not when I tried to return this.  Allegro Medical said all returns were "up to their discretion".  They would not allow me to return this despite the fact I didn't even open the box.  Very misleading &amp; will never buy from Allegro Medical again

The aspirator has no suction power and only irritated my son.  The nail clippers are not sharp enough to cut a newborns soft nails.  I use my own Revlon clipper especially since I am comfortable with the feel of it already.  The thermometer is sooo... slow, I get make an educated guess faster.  The case is cute and I am sure the medicine droppers are ok...haven't needed those yet.  But all in all, I threw half of this kit in the garbage

The one star is for the bag it comes in. You can take these things along with you...but honestly, how many of these things will you really need? Maybe just two of them, the nail clippers and the bulb syringe...I have the set, given to me as a gift. I say, just buy these things separately, it's cheaper and then go out and buy a simple bag to take along with you...it's more practical than buying this whole set..

I was so anxious to get this and when I finally did, my daughter was just  not that interested with it. She barely plays with it. I was hoping that with this she would spend  more time on her tummy because she normally hates that. Maybe that's why she didn't care much for this.

I bought this play gym because I figured it was a baby einstein play gym it has to be good...plus the reviews I read were good. Our local BabiesR'Us didn't have displays of the playgyms so I had no idea that this gym would suck.  I HATE IT!!  My son only loves it cause I put other toys on there.  Notice the pictures that people have shared who state they love this play gym and so does their babies that the toys hanging on the playgyms aren't the ones that originally came with the gym.  Why buy extra toys??  I paid $69 for this gym...it should come with more toys.  I tried to return this for the Gym by Tiny Love that comes with lights, music and lots of toys but when I opened the product the original packaging got messed up and I was unable to return or exchange.  What a waste of money for me.  I received another playgym that my friend bought for $20 from my baby shower. That only came with 3 toys and hung all these toys on there and my son loves that too.  My point is that you don't have to spend so much money on a playgym.  Your babies will love anything as long as there is lots to look at OR if you are going to spend money find one with lots of toys so that you dont 'have to buy extra toys.

I bought this product thinking it was different than the standard square playmats.  I like the scalloped edges, the pillow and the colorful pictures, but I am disappointed in the playmat overall.  The pat mat leaks so bad that I can't use it. The playmat is cute, but it isn't functional, not to mention, WAY OVERPRICED.  The arches have netting which I think freaks my son out.  He has never liked this playmat.  I have a square one that he seems to enjoy more

We bought this product so that I could see my 6 month old son from the front seat.  But everytime I put the rear view mirror on the back window it would pop off and hit my son in the face.  The blinds don't stay up either. Their suctions don't stay if there is any moisture on your windows and when you shut your car door.

I received a SwaddleMe as a gift.  The first problem I discovered was that even with the small size I had received that when I wrapped it around my son, the velcro pieces didn't meet.  In other words, the wrap was too large.  I attached the velcro at the tightest position possible but my son still managed to squeeze his little arms out the neck - not a pretty sight. The next problem I ran into is that while the bottom of the wrap is supposed to support the baby's feet like a womb, my son out of frustration to get out of it would just bust the bottom completely out so that his legs were completely exposed.  In fact, he tore the velcro that secures the bottom pouch to the top.  A friend recommended the Miracle Blanket and although it looks like a straightjacket it works and he has never busted out of it.  It is one size fits all because of its design which is helpful as well

We have this stroller and aren't really thrilled with it.  In fact, we're going to buy a different double stroller to replace it.

Our children are aged 2 years and 4 months.  While the 3 month old was still in his car seat/carrier, this stroller worked well for him.  He's now out grown the carrier, and we've put him in the seat of the stroller.  The shoulder straps are too tight for him and don't adjust well.  The seat isn't padded well and there is no head support.

Our 2 year old does not like the back of the stroller.  With the infant in the front, we have to keep it reclined, so my daughter has to lean forward if she's sitting in the back.  She hates standing on it because she is very short and she can't see anything.  She would much prefer to sit in the front.

We find that the basket in the bottom is practically useless. We can't reach it so we never use it.  There is no cup holder or tray for the parents.

It is also a bit bulky when folded and heavy.

So, I think that we will put this stroller in storage until the kids are older and get a double stroller with 2 seats for now

The idea of the stroller is great. However after purchasing and using it, it isn't well equipped. There is no cup holders, the basket for storage is not easy to get to and isn't even big enough to hold a diaper bag, let alone any bags when shopping. I also have to take it apart to even fit it in my trunk. Need less to say I don't even use it much b/c it is too hard to maneuver with two kids. I wasted my money on this.

Graco has a new one out that looks so much better and much for equipped for on the go Moms like me. Wish I would have waited. It is the same price. Wish I could have exchanged it.

I was very disappointed in this liner.  It seemed like such a great idea, but I could not get it to stick to the tub when there was any more than 2 inches of water in the bath.  Once the water level rose, so did the liner. We ended up returning this product to Amazon

I brought this gift for my son and his wife; their daughter was born on 2/21/07.  when I questioned them as to why they had not used the bottle warmer, they just didn't get around to using it. I insisted they read the directions and start using it. the next day, my son stated. wow mom this is the best baby shower gift.  they could not believe how fast the bottle warmer worked. how much timed it saved them as new parents, and the milk was heated at just the right temperature each time.  my son was so thankful, that I insisted he use the product

I have tried several types of pads and these are the worst! They are very small, thick, and do not hold much, causing them to overflow and leak. I'd recommend the Gerber pads

I have no idea why these itch, but I have tried on multiple occasions to wear these pads and found myself wanting to claw my skin when they are in use!  I haven't had that problem with any other brand and will NOT buy these again.  I'm not continuing to wear the ones left in the box I have, but they make fine sponges for mopping up small spills

I will not buy these again.  They are tiny, thick and do not tapper on the edges.  This means you will see the lines thru your shirts. The adhesive isn't enough and the pads shifted durring the night.  I highly recommend the Lansinoh or Medela, they cover more, are thinner and stick better.

I used these pads when I first started nursing.  They did a good job of keeping me from leaking onto my clothes.  However, my nipples were incredibly sore.  When I took my baby to her first appt., the pediatrician suggested cloth pads.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  Yes, they did cause me to leak through a little, but that was needed.  WHen ALL the moisture from let down is pooled up against your breast it causes sore nipples for some moms.  Don't use these.  Buy some cloth ones instead that will allow your nipples to breath (I use the Imse Vimse)

This accessory system does not fit my Kohlcraft umbrella stroller.  I can find a place to put the parent cupholder, but there is no place at all to put the child's snack tray.  The stroller will not close when it is attached anywhere on the stroller.  The whole purpose of spending the money on this "system"  (which was considerably more expensive than others in the store) was for my child to have a snack tray.  Therefore, it's going back to the store.  There are plenty of other cup accessories out there that are far cheaper than this... even the Prince Lionheart cupholder alone was very expensive... 

The product itself is also very cheaply made.  The "s" hooks look so flimsy I wouldn't trust them... again, they sell thicker, sturdier "s" hooks that look like they will work much better than this, so that's what I'll purchase.  Plus, the parent cupholder is also extremely flimsy... already the "arms" have fallen off several times and that was just moving it from the table to the kitchen counter!    

Thirdly, I'm not sure if it was the "clips" that came in my packet (perhaps a defect) or if they are all made this way... but it is extremely difficult to get the screws into the clips... and then they didn't fasten correctly.  No matter how I tried (I worked on it for close to an hour and I consider myself pretty good at these things!), I could not get the clips to tighten properly.  They continued to be loose... even with using the smaller screws.  Perhaps my stroller tubing is "too small"??? Very unlikely, but it just might be the case.  

This is going back to the store, where I will purchase the insulated parent cupholder for $5, a package of two (thick) "s" hooks for $3 and my child will have to learn to "deal" with holding her snack cup and straw cup.  I will save myself $10, a headache and backache from attempting to continue to get this on correctly, and my child will get the added bonus of learning to be responsible for her own items!!!  Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this product!!!

If I could rate it no stars I would.Let me tell you that my son is now 8, and is perfectly normal, especially as a baby, but I'll tell you what YOU DON'T NEED A MICROWAVE....technically they are dangerous for the fomula,the safest thing to use is room tempature distilled water pour that in with the powdered formula give it HARD shake then your all set...It's that easy don't be lazy and take away vital nutrients from your baby by microwaving their formula

I got this sterilizer because of the Avent name.  My main complaint is that the lid doesn't lock into the base when closing.  You have to use alot of power for it to close.  I have to place it on the floor and stand on it for the sides to lock.

sometimes you just have to spend the money to get the superior product.  buy from pottery barn and order additional covers from them as well.  same pillow but the fleece-like cover exclusively at pottery barn is actual "luxury."  more comfortable for mom and baby.  wears amazingly well due to thickness and stains lift right out.  we have used one cover continuously for over 4 months and it's still like new.  in another class from the "chintzie" alternatives offered at other stores

I was very excited to try out this tent at the beach.  We got it set up and my 4 month old was taking a nap in it out of the sun.  Everything was great until the cabana suddenly collapsed on him.  One of the supports had broken.  It was the first time I'd used it.  I was very disappointed

I received this as a gift and loved it at first.  But after using it just 3 times one of the support poles snapped when we were putting it up.  I was bummed too because I loved it so much.  If you do buy it, be careful when you handle it - it's not as durable as it seems

We cannot get the refill bags into our Diaper Dekor Plus. Are there different size bags depending on whether you got the regular or plus unit? The lady in the store said NO so we bought 3 boxes of extra refills. Now we cant use any of them. What should we do

I can't begin to convey the frustration I felt when trying to use the refill.  I struggled for 20 minutes trying to slip the too-tight bag over the cartridge.  The Diaper Dekor works wonderfully as a single-use item, but at about $30-40 a pop, it is the most expensive garbage can outside of Ted Kozolowski's apartment.  The printed instructions were clear-- it's just that they product does not do what it supposed to do

Some assembly is required.  I consider myself to be fairly skilled at assmebling things...  I have an engineering degree... I've put together bikes, furniture, installed car stereos, and this thing was an absolute pain, especially for such a simple device.  I found the instructions to be woefully inadequate.  

I found the images to be useless, and the instructions leave out fairly critical steps - like how to orient various pieces together.  Takes 10 times longer to install then it would if they had taken the effort to provide more guidance.

It was aggravating enough to make me go straight to Amazon upon finishing to leave feedback...  I didn't even buy it from Amazon.

The gate itself is fine

I purchased this potty for my son. I thought that the "royal" turns would give him an interest in using it, it didn't. He used it once and cried! He would not sit on it again. I was very disappointed. The potty would sing for now reason sometimes and EVERY TIME you would touch it. I do not recommend

I would recommend just buying one that sits on top of the toilet and a stepping stool. You don't have to clean #2 out of the cup and you'll probably already have a stepping stool so that your child can reach the sink. It really saves a lot of hastle

My mother-in-law and I both bought this potty for my daughter.  (One for her house and one for mine.)  It was hard for me to put together, my Mo-in-Law couldn't get it together at all.  

It makes a loud trumpet sound every time "water" passes a sensor inside the toilet that scared my daughter terribly at first, but luckily it took a lot of batteries to work and it died.

The other thing I'd like to point out is if your child actually likes the noise and the batteries die, they are almost impossible to replace.  In order to replace them you have to take almost the whole toilet apart, which again is very hard to put back together.

We got ours on sale so I don't mind the expenditure.  When you are buying these things just remember it is only a toilet that they will be using for a year or so tops...

My husband and I were so excited to receive this as a gift when our daughter was born.  He has been using it up to now, and I used it this week for the first time.  Our daughter is 9 1/2 months and 21 pounds.  It was easy enough to get it on and off my back alone.  The problem is the horrible pain it caused while walking and the excrutiating neck pain I have after just a two mile walk!!!  I can't wait to get rid of this and buy a quality carrier that allows you to enjoy a walk!!!  I would NEVER recommend that someone buys this!

I bought this for my son who is almost 1 year old.  I ended up returning it 3 days later.  I am a petite woman (5'2") and this item was totally uncomfortable!  I still have bruises under my arms from this item.  I followed all directions and no matter what could not get it properly positioned as shown in the pictures of the manual.  It bounced on my back and the straps dug into my armpits.  I would NOT reccomend this item for anyone who is as petite as I am.  NOT WORTH THE MONE

The good thing is that, except for the spring, the jumper is pretty nice. Unfortunately, the spring is THE most important part and it is not good. It has low elasticity and our baby did not like it as he had to push really hard to get anything exciting out of it. We gave it away for free and will buy a different one for our new baby girl

This seemed like the original johnny jump-up I had for my first child 13 years ago.  We loved that one, so I got this one for my baby and after spending almost half an hour figuring out how to put it together, it didn't work very well.  It just didn't seem as SPRINGY as it should be.  I ended up returning it and getting the $40 version with the tray instead (the Jump &amp; Go).  People have complained about the tray pinching baby's fingers against the doorway, but we have a wide doorway, so it works well and is a lot springier.  Also, our little guy likes the toy tray on the Jump &amp; Go version a lot

I unpacked this warmer which we received as a gift - did not use one with our first child.  I got as far as filling the removable reservoir with water before I decided to return it.  You literally fill a plastic reservoir with water and turn it upside down so that the lid to the reservoir, which slides on, has no rubber seal or other watertight implements, can leak everywhere.  Judging by the other comments, I'm glad it leaked before I had a chance to use it and burn up a box of wipes.

I should have checked this out before registering for it.  The lid won't stay shut, the bottom wipes brown, the unit leaks.  I contacted the manufacturer.  When telling him about the lid not staying shut, he asked, "are you sure there isn't a ghost in the house"...they offered to replace it if I returned it to them,  offering to compensate for shipping charges with some of their other products.

After reading these reviews I think I'll just trash this unit and buy a different manufacturers product

We received the wipe warmer as a gift and our baby was happy with the warm wipes... that is... until I lifted the unit up and found that it had damaged the wood changing table it was on because water leaks from the bottom.  Upon further inspection I noticed that the bottom wipes were all burnt and brown even though I had filled it up at least once a day.  It seems that all the water going in was subsequently coming out the bottom.  Originally I had thought that perhaps I had a defective model, but after searching online, I noticed that a vast number of parents had the same experience we had, and now have decided to buy a different brand.  I did keep the water filled, and still had a poor experience.  Save your money and invest in a different brand

This wipe warmer is more trouble than it's worth.  The water resevoir would not hold the water and kept leaking all over the changing table.  As a result the wipes would dry out and the warmer burnt the wipes.  I emailed the manufacturer regarding this product  to see if they had a fix or if my product was defective.  They failed to respond

This wipes warmer was to replace the one that got broken in our move. We use cloth wipes it has burned a few, smells moldy no matter what I have done to clean it (never happened with any of our other wipes warmers) won't stay closed. It actually got so hot it melted the 'moisture dispenser' and melted/burned the little foamish piece in it. Then last night we refilled it one last time before we could head out today to buy a new different one and leaked water all over the changing table. GET a different warmer this one is awful

We actually went through two of these in two weeks. The first one cooked the bottom 20+ wipes, so we returned it thinking that it was simply defective. The second one did the exact same thing! We wasted so many wipes with this warmer, since they were "cooked". We have even emailed the company and sent them pictures, but never heard back from them. Save your money

I have 2 wipes warmers - one for upstairs and one for downstairs.  At one point, I had this particular wipes warmer and it just does not work - mine took FOREVER to warm the wipes and would only warm the bottom section; same as previous reviews, the lid would not stay shut and the wipes would not pop up properly.  I have two other different brands of wipes warmers that work fine.  Do not waste your money on the Munchkin warmer

This wipe warmer does not function simply because the lid won't stay closed.  I waste time trying to get the lid closed while my baby is crying on the changing table.  The wipes cool off and dry out because of the poorly designed and flimsy lid.  Don't buy this wipe warmer, there are better ones out there.

I bought this for my baby who, at 6 months was barely 16 lbs. She didn't hit the 20lb mark until she was past 18 months old, so she was rear facing for a long time. She loved kicking this but the mirror never worked well, I could adjust it and within a day or two it was all over and I couldn't see my baby again. The water seemed to evaporate and now just over a year later has hardly any water in it. We can't find any leaks but there's little water. The little fish inside stuck together right away and we could never get them back apart. Sadly we just gave up on it by her first birthday. It never worked for us as a mirror to see her and the toy part, while it was fun to kick at, was just worthless. My sister in law wanted one for my niece but I am glad she saw how worthless mine was before wasting her money on this

I picked this up at my Babies R Us store because it looked like so much fun for my baby and with the mirror, I would be able to keep an eye on her. From the minute I brought it home, it smelled awful, like artificial grapes. I have aired it out in our garage for two months now and it still stinks.  At this point I am just going to throw it out because I can't imagine having that smell in my car! (I have since been back to Babies R Us to see if the other ones they have smell as bad, and they do.) Don't buy it without smelling it

This toy is very cute however my 8 month baby has difficulty kicking the feet pads to make the fish move.  It ends up moving all around and I can not see in the mirror.  The plus is that it is something for her to look at instead of just the seat.

I just took a course from the Florida Highway Safety program.  I thought something like this would be wonderful, especially for little ones in the rear facing position.  I was dead wrong.  Anything put in front of, on the side of, in fact, anything in the car is a real safety hazard in case of a crash.  This toy, even latched down, poses a threat to the baby.  He or she may just have to be bored for a while.  On long trips have Mom or Dad or sibling in the back seat with baby for entertainment

This is very cute but my baby is chubby. It gave him a cut and bruises on both legs. The seat isn't big enough for chubby babies so it cut his legs off. I wish it was bigger cause this is really cute. So if you have a chubby baby avoid this because it can cause bruising and cuts

I bought these because they come with foam inserts to help collect leakage. I'm a 38 DD and use the large flange for my medela pump, so I too found the sharp edge that contacts the breast was cutting into my sore areola/nipple. The ameda shells had a round edge and were much more comfortable, although leakage city!  My sore nipples got nearly instantly better using my brest friend (great proper latch!), and treatment for a mild yeast infection. Hope this helps

I received a Diaper Genie as a shower gift, and gave it a chance.  After 8 weeks, we replaced it with a Diaper Champ, which is much better at containing odor.

The problem we had with the Genie is that it is too  hard to use.  You're supposed to put the diaper halfway into a neck thing, then twist twice.  When we did this, about 50% of the time, the twists would come undone, leaving the room exposed to the diaper smell.  Neither my husband or I could determine how to fix this once it happened, and ended up emptying the darn thing at least daily.  

The Diaper Champ, however, is one-handed operation, which the Genie is not (you can't open the lid with one hand holding a baby and the 2nd a diaper!).  It contains the smell incredibly well, as long as you follow the directions (fold your diapers into balls, and don't leave smelly stuff exposed to mess up the lid).  We actually keep a small roll of diaper disposal bags for the "blowouts", which we have about once a week, to keep the Champ clean.  It has been a wonderful new baby tool

Years ago when the Diaper Genie first hit the market. I was given one as a gift for my baby shower. It did not work the way I thought it would. The Genie was supposed to dispose of the diapers by sealing them so that no odor would be present. This was not the case. The smell seemed to linger in the room longer then just disposing of the diapers as normal in the trash. Also the smell that the Genie left after opening the Genie to dispose of the long tied knots of diapers was horrible. I had to clean it several times just to get the smell out. Needless to say when I had my second child and once again received one. It remained in the box and it still sits in the box after five years. I would definitely not recommend this item for new moms. Too much hassle

I didn't use mine for the first two weeks of my daughter's life because it was waaaaaaaaaaaaay too complicated! I figured it out, sort of, but to this day when I push the diaper in the film rips. Then when it comes time to change the film, the top doesn't cut the film so I have to use scissors. My sister-in-law told me to register for it. Why did I listen to her!
Don't buy it! Dont register for it! It's not worth it! I want a refund

I thought this would be a great idea to keep the jars in, but really, it took up too much counter space.  I ended up putting it away and putting the jars into all the nooks and crannies in my cupboards as I personally do not have the space to waste for something that is completely unnecessary, I found.  Save your money

I bought this potty seat for my daughter and I took into consideration that this was supposed to fit regular and elongated toilets. The second I put my daughter on it she nearly fell into the toilet! The seat is not very stable and as far as being able to go on most toilets, that is a lie. My toilet seat is as regular as they come and it still falls through. A waste of money and a safety hazard

I bought this product for childproofing purposes.  I was disappointed to learn upon delivery that the manufacturer's instructions state not to install gate against drywall (which was not in the item description), so i cannot use it where i needed it.  Also, the unlocking mechanism is quite difficult to open and close, especially with a small child in your arms.

This is a great gate if you have a strong, healthy back and always have two hands available.  But how many people with kids have both of those!  It was great at keeping my baby in the room, but my 4 year old couldn't open it and neither could her grandma.  And it made me and my husband want to cuss.  It is back in the box and in the return pile.  Don't waste your money.

The quality of this swaddle blanket is very good, I'm not complaining about that. The problem we've had with our newborn is that as he squirms the blanket rides up and hits his cheeks.  This triggers his newborn rooting instinct, which makes him search around frantically for a nipple to suck on. Instead of lulling him to sleep it gets him frantic with hunger. 
I recommend the sleep sac from this same company instead of this item. We own two of them, and they keep our baby very cozy and warm

I bought this sling when I was still pregnant.  After my son was born I tried putting him in it but he just didn't seem secure, so i threw it in the back of the closet.  When he turned one, I dug it out again, thinking it would work well as a hip carrier,but it is even worse for this!  I had him in this a total of five minutes and it was awful.  First of all, the buckles should not be placed so they hit the wearer either on the neck or the shoulder bone, it is very painful with a heavier baby.  I took him out of it and will never touch the thing again

My son was 7 lbs 1 oz when he was born and 20 inches long... He wasnt the tiniest baby... I tried putting him in the sling and it just looks like he's falling and being enveloped by this huge orange thing... It's the WORST product ever, I am definitely NOT using it and will probably donate it to goodwill..

I bought this seat to travel with my toddler and found it extremely annoying and difficult to use.  The tray stuck and never loosened up and was difficult to get my child in and out of.  Also, it was close to impossible to keep clean, unless you unstrapped it and took it completely apart after every use.  It was very unwieldy to travel with.  It folded up, but didn't stay together and so was not very portable.  Because it was so cumbersome, it ended up getting dropped on a laminate floor and promptly broke.  The cheap plastic its made of shattered at the bottom corner where the side and seat fit, so now it is in the garbage where it belongs.  I only owned it for five months and used it barely three times a month for the average.  Yes, it was cheap, but as they say, the poor man buys everything twice, and now I'm out fifteen dollars and have to buy another booster.

We bought this toy for our 10 month old daughter, who just love to make noise with anything. She also loves to stick things in her mouth because she's teething. One day, she was trying to stick the shaker with the bells in her mouth. the metal from one of the bells cut her lip! We let her play with the other ones still, but the one with the bells is put away at least until she's older

Don't buy this stroller. The only good thing about it is that you won't be sad if you leave it somewhere. The "restraints" don't restrain at all. My one year old twins barely stay in it so when we're in a store they can reach very far to pull down all sorts of things. (not safe) The stroller barely fits through regular door ways - and I mean barely fits. It does not maneuver well at all and is difficult to stear. The "adult drink cup holder" snaps off when struggling to go through doors and I don't have to describe what a mess that is. I'm just lucky I don't drink hot coffee; otherwise I would be suing the manufacturer for burns to the children. There is no storage. The "saddle bags" can hold a few small things but you should only use it for things you don't mind the children being able to reach. This stroller is not only a nuisance, it has potentially dangerous features, so please don't buy it

Exactly 3 months after I bought this stroller, a bracket on the back that holds the bars together popped off, making it dangerous and impossible to use.  Luckily I bought the extended warranty and will receive a full refund (in-store warranty expired just 3 days previously).  

When I tested the stroller at the store, I thought it seemed very flimsy and felt it wouldn't last long (which is why I bought the warranty), but the idea of having such a great stroller is why I decided to take the chance.  PROS for the stroller:  very light, compact and easy to fold; easy to maneuver; great for tall people like me--don't have to hunch over to reach the handles.  There are some nice little things too, like ventilation for the back, a headrest, a cup-holder, and a reclining position.

CONS are: only rated for carrying children under 40 lbs in each seat (didn't know this when I purchased it)--I have a 35 lb. 2 y.o. and a newborn, so we don't exceed the limit there, but my 42 lb. 3 1/2 y.o. can't use it.  The canopy doesn't cover kids well from the shade (only the face--and that's a big deal when living in southern AZ--or if it's raining)--and when the seat is reclined (for my newborn) the canopy doesn't even cover her head (I have to clip on a blanket and drape it over).  My 2-y.o. practically is too big for it--her head extends above the top of the seat.  And finally, the general construction of the stroller is not sturdy.

Overall, this COULD be a GREAT stroller, but it's just not sturdy--obviously not, it broke--but one would expect that with a brand name "Jeep" it would be built better.  We only use it for walks and going out, no off-trail stuff--we used it about 10 times before it broke.  My umbrella stroller I bought 6 years ago is still going strong--why can't they make this just as well-built?   I would love this stroller if it were just built better

Heed the bad reviews. I think the problem may be Medela's definition of "occasional use." I used this pump about once every other day or two for a month and a half--and apparently that is deemed more than occasional, because the pump yields very little now... about half of what it used to. So this is yet another review that leads to the same conclusion: I should have gotten a different pump

I agonized over whether to buy this cheaper pump or go straight to one of the high-end ($250+) models. In an effort to save money I started with this one. But I quickly realized I'd made a mistake -- it took *forever* to even get one ounce of milk. I ended up getting the Medela Pump In Style and loved it. I just wish I'd gone straight to that one and saved my money on this one.

For those of you who are trying to decide between this or a more expensive model, here are my two cents:

TRY THIS ONE IF...
- You have a very abundant milk supply
- You only plan to pump one or twice a month
- You wouldn't mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended period

INVEST THE MONEY IN A HIGHER-END MODEL IF...
- You're going back to work
- Your milk supply is medium to low
- You plan to pump more than two or three times per month
- You are opposed to giving your baby any formula, ever (with a higher quality pump you could build up reserve breastmilk to have in case of an emergency)

Also, it's worth noting that most of the more expensive models can be safely re-used by other people so could be sold to someone else when you're done (unlike this one)

I was very disappointed with this pump. It was very loud and stopped working after 3 weeks, and I only used it once a day. Even more disappointing was the companys return policy. You have to ship it to them at your expense, wait for them to send you a new one, and return that one to the store. Do not waste your time

This was the second pump I purchased. I was hoping that it would turn out better than the first brand I bought. This pump is a pain in the neck to put together and the pump that is not hooked to the AC plug in is much weaker than the other side. The motor died out after 2 weeks of use. This pump is not meant for everyday use. I just bought a Medala and I hope to have a better expeirence with it

I wish I would have read the reviews on this before I bought the pump. This is a bad breast pump. I couldn't get anything out of my breasts with this except for sore nipples. It has very poor suction, is a pain to put together, and is uncomfortable to use. [...] So don't waste your time and money buy something different. If I could have rated this a negative I would have

This is the worst pump you could buy.  I have gone through 3 of them because the motor breaks down.  It also has put me behind in what my daughter is drinking while I am at work.  PLEASE don't waste your money.......  I also spoke with hospitals and they mentioned that they have many many complaints about this product.  If you don't believe the bad reviews call the hospital and they will tell you the same thing.  I recently got a new pump from a friend and found that the evenflow is by far the LOUDEST pump on the planet -- there is no descreet pumping for you if you own this product

I used to have a Graco Metrolite stroller, and I really liked it. However, I gave it to a relative because it went with an infant travel system. I bought a used Jeep Liberty Stroller, thinking it would be an upgrade, and boy was I wrong. 

I will simply list the things I do not like:
1) It is quite bulky when folded, especially compared to other strollers I've had.
2) It is heavy, awkward to carry, and there's nowhere apparent to grab it. Handles? I don't see any.
3) All 3 tires went flat. My local bike shop charged about $30 to replace them all (your mileage may vary).
4) My daughter was not interested in the steering wheel and since the battery that the previous owner left in it had corroded, the sounds didn't work so I can't comment on those.
5) It CREAKS when you push it. I'm not sure where the sound is coming from but we oiled the wheels and it still creaks.
6) The MP3 player, which is the "cool factor" and the only reason my husband has prevented me from getting rid of the stroller, has these small speakers near the baby's head, so in order to really hear the music if you're playing music YOU like, you have to turn it up. And the volume doesn't go very high. For the same money, you could probably buy some portable powered speakers and clip them to the stroller.

I bought this chair because it got such good reviews and looks great. I was so sick of seeing fish, butterflies and primary colors all over our house - the neutral tones were a sight for sore eyes! 

But I've been so disappointed in this chair's function. With all the nooks and crannies in the buckles and straps, it's impossible to keep clean. The straps and parts of the vinyl seat became so caked with food that I threw them into the washing machine - even though the tags says not to.

The worst part of the seat is the tray. It's ridiculously wide -- too big for my dishwasher AND my kitchen sink! (And both are full sized.) The way my toddler smears food on the tray, there's no way I could just wipe it with a rag and be done with it. Washing it turns into an exercise in hosing down my countertops with the sink sprayer. Oh well, at least they get clean too...

Also, I agree with other reviewers that it's really difficult to slide the tray into place. I wind up shaking it around and my poor toddler looks at me like I'm torturing him. 

On the bright side, the recline feature is wonderful for infants and babies who are just getting the hang of sitting up. Overall, if I had it to do over again I'd pick a simple Fisher Price..

I'm a big believer in reading Amazon reviews -- customers rarely lead me astray!  But this chair (which we bought specifically because of everyone's praise) is miserable!  I don't understand why it got such high marks...  The tray is way too huge for easy cleaning and it (rather than the chair) has a "leg separator," which means you can't set it down anywhere without it tipping all over the place.  We've also found that the tray can be EXTREMELY difficult to hook onto the chair, and doesn't push in towards the baby's belly far enough.  In addition, the clips that attach the harness are filled with grooves and can't be cleaned well, so they're beyond gross, just after a few feedings.  Of all the baby things we wish we'd never bought, this is number one on the list...  I can't help feeling that if we'd just closed our eyes and pointed at random to a high chair, we would have done better than this thing...  The only reason it gets ONE star is because I appreciate the non-obnoxious print -- it's nice to not have something on display with clowns or fish or teddy bears or bright colors.  ;

Ok, this chair is fine except for two very important things.  One: the tray is huge, and not in a good way, in a really hard to clean and maneuver kind of way. Also, the two trays that fit on top, that are dishwasher safe, ARE TOO BIG TO FIT IN THE DISHWASHER!!! So what's the point???
Two: it has the little thing that separates the legs on the TRAY, rather than on the chair...making it impossible to set down anywhere when it's full of food and your baby is yelling to get out of the chair.  Everything else, about the chair is great, but you can find these other features in just about any other high chair.  I'm bought the one that's made by the famous toy maker, and love it

I could not get this mirror to angle properly in our Honda CR-V to give a view of the baby, and when my wife held the mirror on the seat as a test, the image of the baby was so small that I could discern no details about what the baby was doing. The mirror is also distorting. The image only appears focused and in the appropriate dimensions if you look DIRECTLY into the center of the mirror.

I bought this so I could check to make sure my baby was ok since he can't hold his head up quite yet and so I could see my cute baby's face in the mirror while driving in our Honda Odyssey minivan.  He's in an infant car seat though and I couldn't see anything at all either from my mirror or turning around to look into his mirror. I finally figured out I had to somehow raise the headrest and fit the mirror on the headrest.  I'm still worried about it flying off but it does work now. Perhaps it would work on the window but I didn't bother.  On the window, it would be held by suction and I really don't want that thing possibly flying off and hitting my baby

I thought that this would be really helpful when it comes to making sure that I have clean nipples for my baby.  Unfortunately, when you read the instructions for most latex nipples, they aren't dishwasher safe, and you are instructed to hand wash.  So, having a dishwasher container for nipples is pretty useless.  I use mine as a container that I can airdry my handwashed nipples in.  Don't waste your money

I thought I would love this, but it just takes too much time and energy.  Germs can go through cloth once it is wet from saliva.  Then this material has been rubbed all over the cart and then I put it in my car etc.  I just don't see the difference in that and not using it.  My hands touch it, baby's hands touch it etc.  I have enough to keep track of with a bag, baby, wallet, cell phone....I just dont have enough to keep track of a giagantic piece of material!  My grocery store has those sanitary wipes outside the store by the carts and I wipe down the handle bar....that is far more effective against germs.  You are better off buying a $3 thing of purel hand cleaner than this bulky, ineffective cloth

Very disappointed. I bought this in hopes of relief from pain and pressure after I pulled a pelvic muscle at about 30 weeks pregnant. It has not helped me and has been annoying. The L-XL is too large but the S-M was too small. The material folds and rolls under my clothes and there's nowhere for the extra flap of material in front to go. I get sweaty underneath it and it's difficult to get my underwear back under it after using the bathroom---which I'm obviously doing frequently at 34 weeks! This was the only pregnancy belt available at the shop I went to. I wish I'd had the chance to try on others to compare

I bought this just before my third trimester when the back pain from lifting a 30 lb two-year-old all day long became absolutely unbearable.  It wasn't quite what I was expecting, and came nowhere near giving me the support in my back and belly that I was looking for.  It helped a teeny tiny bit, but the construction is such that it just can't provide much support (it's a little heavier-weight than a bra, with no additional elastic). 
I bought the other one, by loving comfort, and was thrilled.  It's a little bit more intimidating, perhaps, and less, uh, sexy, but it really works in all the ways that this one didn't.  It slings my belly up nicely and takes over the work for my pained muscles.  Ahhhhh

This item is misleading because it runs VERY small.  I am a pre-pregnancy size 6 and I ordered the s/m size based on the waistline.....WRONG!  I am in my 35th week of pregnancy and this thing barely would fit around my lower abdomen.  Not only does it run small, but it also fold and wrinkles anytime I move so it is not much help.  If you are shorter or petite, the waistband is VERY wide in the back and can be ill-fitting (does not conform to the curve of your spine). It is definately made for taller, longer-torso women (aka 6 ft. models). I would go with another type of support if given another chance

If I could have given this no stars I would have. This product in L-XL only fits a pre-pregnancy 28"-34" waist. And in sizes that only goes up to a 18. So now I'm on the search for something a little bit bigger.  So if your pre-pregnancy size is any bigger then a 16 on the safe side, dont waste your money or time by getting this

I have owned the bed and it is very DANGEROUS for a child. I am stunned that this product is still on the market. while it is very cute, and fairly priced you hardly get what you pay for. My daughter loved the look of this--- her first "big girl" bed. that was until it fell to pieces with her in IT! The metal rails that are to hold the bed together, and the matress in place, are not properly planned out. If you can even manage to get this bed built--- which is difficult, much more so than it seems at first---- the metal support bars fall out when the child gets into the bed. it is flimsy, poorly designed, dissapointing, and DANGEROUS. delta should be ashamed

I am so disgusted that I woke at 5am on black friday to drive 12 miles to walmart to purchase a Dora toddler bed. I held the Dora toddler bed until christmas, when on Christmas eve I went to put it together and the pieces were package wrong  and I was unable to assemble the bed at all. I ended up returning the bed, in exchange fr nothing. I found out that they no longer carry the bed.

I purchased this bed online last year.  It looks great and as we all know our daughters love Dora.  However, the bed was a disaster to put together and if your not handy, you would problably give up.  The rods that come with the bed do not stay in the holes, and for a very active 3 year old this bed will not last 3 months. &amp;#60;br /&amp;#62;
What a waste of money, invest a bed that your child can growth with, and something that will withstand the active lifestyle of the average child

My son, who was used to using a wood stool (8" tall with slick wood feet) fell climbing up on this because the top (foot area) is too small and it tipped on him!  It's only 6" wide on top.  Not much room for clumsy toddlers to turn around on.  If you push it in toward the toilet there is NOTHING left for the child to stand on.  If you leave it out, then it takes up more room and the arc design is a waste.  Getting down he also started to fall because it was such a narrow top.  

His feet still dangled as he sat on the toilet - not coming near the top of this 8 1/2" tall stool.

This is advertised as being 10" tall (actually 8 1/2") 14" long (correct, but top surface is only 11 1/2") and 10" wide (also correct but again, it is only 6" wide on top)

The rubber feet are great for non-skid purposes, but that's the only positive thing I have to say about this.

Nine days from MN to PA seems too long; perhaps Target Direct got process problems.   I AM NOT SATISIFIED...got the same three pack of bottles which I bought at the same time as this gift pack at my local CVS for $1.50 less and did not have to wait nine days for it

I registered for these bottles I am a new mom and thought the variety was great. We used the stage one nipple and my son was able to suck down his formula with no problem infact way to quick. He would struggle with feeding time. He was so gassy and had horrible reflux, that during feeding he would arch his back stffin his body and cry. I did have a recommendation to switch to the Dr. Brown bottles which made a huge diffrence. However, he was still spiting up and still a little gassy just not as bad and it was managable, their stage 1 nipples were to small and the stage two were to big. We had gone on a camping trip and I bought the Playtex disposable bottles for easier cleaning. I also had done some research on these bottles and found several people liked them better then the Dr. Brown. So I tried them and my son is doing much better he dosen't even spit up anymore. So if you like the ventair I think you would like the disposable much better. My sons Dr. wanted to put him on an antacid but I was not comfortable with giving him medication at such a young age I wanted to see if I could solve the problem, which I have done completly with the Playtex disposable bottles!

I thought that these would be great, but could never get them to work right. Sometimes they would flow sometimes not. I would have to take the bottom off to make it work and then remember to put it back on after using them or dump it all over. To many pieces, to much trouble, I would be upset and my baby would be also! Switched to Avent and loving it

These bottles leak after a few months and it's hard to find new parts for the botttom of the bottle. You almost have to buy more bottles to get new parts when they leak.

We ordered this gate with the special attachments for our staircase.  First of all, we had to order 4 different pieces to make it work, since they make you order each little piece separately.  We spent all night putting it together and it didn't work for us.  The actual gate is very small, I don't see how it would be big enough for any opening.  Even with the extension kit, it was still not long enough.  The extension kit is so rickety that it just kept falling apart.  It is a very poor design and way overpriced.  We spent over $150 (with shipping and all of the extras we had to buy) for this piece of junk that just kept falling apart.  Save your money and buy a different gate

I purchased this gate to keep my daughter out of the kitchen.  Unfortunately every time you walk through the swing gate you have to readjust it, which makes it impossible to close with one hand. Even if you don't care about the one-hand feature, it is still a hassle to adjust.  I do not suggest buying this gate.

Unfortunately, despite the fact that it advertises that it will fit any doorway, I have high baseboards on each side of the opening and only one side of the gate adjusts to accomodate high baseboards.  It was not sturdy at all, returned it

I purchased this gate thinking in would be perfect for a high traffic area. I was totally wrong!!! Every time you walk through the swing gate you have to readjust it, which makes in impossible to open and close with one hand. Forget it if you have to get through in a hurry, 'cause it needs to be readjust to open AND close it. Plus the gray bumper on mine is loose, so if I can get the top bracket to fit correctly, the bottom one is to lose and not secure. I have to get on my hands and knees to readjust it correctly so I can close it, only to go through the same readjusting hassle in a few minutes. I would have returned this gate, but I trashed the box before I installed it

I thought this would be great for the size. The changing pad is just a very thin piece of plastic.  It provides no padding at all. The case itself is padded.  Why didn't they use the padding on the changing "pad" instead of the case? Very uncomfortable for baby. (It is basically like laying out a piece of paper.)I'd rather use those small padded things that come with most diaper bags

I had tried this for my newborn and I think this product is unsafe and not sturdy.  The base of the seat is very wobbley, it would help to have suction cups on the bottom.  And  you do have to fill your tub about half way in order for your child to stay warm.  Also, when I put my baby in the seat and he is 12 lbs, the seat tipped backwards.  I can imagine that it would be worse when my child is heaviear and moves around more.  I do not think this product is safe.  It would make a great product if they included a baby tub with it.  So I returned the product and ended up with the 4-in-1 bath station from Safety First that worked well with my first child

The bumper was very cute and colorful and I was excited to put it on the baby's crib...until I put it on...no matter how I tried to fit it onto the crib (it is a white spindle Jenny Lind crib full-size) it fit very akwardly and never quite right. There were large spaces where it should have fit snugly around the inside of the crib. I was very disappointed since it is very colorful and matches the sheet and comforter we received as gifts

I really thought these were the cutest bumper pads, but after hearing over and over again how you shouldn't use bumper pads because of risk of suffication, I decided it wouldn't be worth the risk to put them on the crib.  I don't think there are enough ties on them to hold them securely for one, and even if there were I wouldn't be comfortable with the thought of my daughter getting her head caught up under them.  She has been able to scoot across her crib since she was a newborn so there was never an ideal time to use these.  Again, cute for the nursery set up pre-baby, but I wouldn't use afterwards

I am a previous Britax owner. I purchased the Britax Roundabout for my daughter when she was 4 months. At 18 months she was only 5 inches from outgrowing it. Since we had such a plesant experience with the roundabout we decided to stay with the Britax brand and purchase the Marathon in the Olivia print. I was very dissapointed.
I had a major issue with the straps comming loose while we were driving. When we would get to our destination the straps were so loose there was virtually nothing holding her into her seat. A huge scare for any parent at the thought of what could happen when you slam on your brakes. It also lacked the supurb comfort that britax boasts of. My daughter was never as comfortable in the marathon as she was in her roundabout. The rubber things that go over the straps were also incredibly annoying. The constantly slid down out of place and by the end of the trip the chest clip was in my childs lap. That coupled with the straps comming loose were defentially not expected of britax high saftey standards. I went through quite the fiaso returning this seat and after 3 returns I bought the Eddie Bauer seat instead. So far I have no complaints. I wouldn't waste my money on this. Buy the roundabout if you want Britax name, but please dont bother with this Marathon

This was given to us as a present, but I would have never bought it for myself.  Here are the problems: 1) we have a platform bed and you cannot shorten the height so it was worthless as a cosleeper.  We still tried to use it as a bassinet but...2) the mattress is so thin and uncomfortable our daughter would cry when you put her in it.  I tried to put extra padding  which worked ok, but still not great.  3)Once she was bigger it would have been nice if this converted to a deeper thing like a pack and play to use in the living room, but the bassinet part is fixed.  I would have been happier with a regular pack and play which had a removable bassinet.  Ultimately we happily gave it away after about 5 months

I loved this item at face value - it looks good, the materials are good quality, it feels secure, and the premise of the functionality of the bed was what I wanted because I planned on breastfeeding my newborn and wanted her close by. I was proud of my purchase and showed it to many of my friends before the baby came.  Well, the "mattress" that comes with it is so hard that my baby won't sleep in it. She won't nap in it, and when I put her down all she does is cry.  I've tried everything to get her to sleep in this thing because it would be so helpful if she would, but she won't sleep in it at all.  I've even tried making it softer by putting blankets down on the board of a mattress and covering this with a receiving blanket that I tuck in the sides (something I don't want to do because of the SIDS factor) and that doesn't even help - it's still too hard of a surface.  Now, my baby is sleeping in bed with me and I can't get any sleep because I'm afraid of rolling over on her or her rolling off of the bed.  If they'd just make the mattress more comfortable for the baby, this would be a perfect product and I'd rate it a 5, but because it's virtally useless to me and my baby due to the mattress/board, I have to rate it only 2 stars.  I'm so let down by this product

This is a great product for a few weeks, then the velcro gets really weak and your child will be busting out!  I go in to find my son with both arms out and one leg out.  No matter how tight I make the blanket, the velcro comes apart.  I encourage you to buy their other SwaddleMe blanket with the larger velcro flap.

I received this crib sheet today and am returning it tomorrow.  Although the tag reads "100% cotton," it is most certainly not the soft, 100% jersey cotton advertised.  The print is cute, but I was looking for something a little softer and warmer now that the snow is falling.  I gave this item 1 star because of the false advertising, but if one is looking for a nice, regular cotton crib sheet, this would probably be okay

Just as the other mothers have stated, nothing about this pump is beneficial.  It was given to me by a lactation nurse, but it was more trouble than it was worth.  Only once was I able to pump more than one ounce (it took almost an hour), and I hurt so much afterward nursing my son was agonizing.  I only needed it occassionally, but this was such a waste of time I bought the pump in style, which is amazing.

This is not comparable to the more expensive Medela pumps, so if you want something that works with little discomfort, invenst in the pump in style or similar model.  Don't waste your money, even if it is cheap

LUCKY FOR ME I DIDN'T PAY FOR THIS PUMP BUT THE HOSPITAL GAVE IT TO ME. I COULD ONLY GET TWO DROPS OF MILK FOR EVERY TEN PUMPS. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME. YOU WOULD FIGURE THE HOSPITAL WOULD KNOW IF THE PUMP WORKED

This pump was refered to me by the hospital where I had my first son.  So since I got it and used it.  My breast hurt worse using this pump then when I was engorged.  It was one of the worst experiances.  I was under the impression that this was suppose to help with day to day with a new baby.  I connot recommend enough to NOT use this one.  I am know expecting again and looking for a pump.  I know that I will not go by hospital recommendation again

I bought this pump because it had the medela name and I thought it was reliable. I was wrong. This is the worst pump in the world. Everything the other poster said is true. This is the worst breastpump. I would NOT recommend this breastpump to anyone

I recently purchased this booster as well as the Britax Starriser booster seat (I have two cars/two toddlers and an infant).  My children argue over who gets to ride in the Starriser.  For some reason they are not as comfortable in the Parkway.  My theory is that it is too much like a car seat rather than a booster -- and they feel "too snug" in it.  They even look uncomfortable in it. The one advantage of the Parkway over the Starriser is the increase neck protection if they should fall asleep.  If I had to do it over, I would have purchased two of the Starrisers instead of the Parkway. BTW, I purchased the Britax Companion for my infant and I LOVE it

We purchased Storkcraft's Rochester Stages Crib in Natural, Aspen Changing table, 5 Drawer Dresser, 3 Drawer Dresser, 2 side units (left and right) and a hutch. Every single piece of furniture that we've gotten from Storkcraft is damaged in some way ~ nicks and scratches and paint on a lot of the pieces. On the side panel of the 5 drawer dresser the piece is completely cracked. It's obvious that Storkcraft has no quality control. We're in the process of deciding whether or not we're going to return all of the furniture or just get replacement parts and/or a new unit. All I'm going to say is don't waste your time on purchasing Storkcraft furniture

My daughter placed this crib on her registry, mainly because of  the price. She didn't want anyone spending $500.00 on a crib and this one matched the style she was looking for. I found this set up at a "Depot" store and it was beautiful and sturdy, but didn't come in natural. So I went home and ordered it online. It arrived 4 days before the shower(8 days early from ETA)but it was shattered. The first 3 pieces we looked at were split, chipped &amp; crushed. Quite a surprize considering the box wasn't in bad shape. We decided to return it and buy a more expensive model(at a local specialty store). Amazon's return policy was amazing, a click on the mouse and the next day UPS picks up. No packing labels to print, no lugging big heavy items to post office, very simple. Amazon gets 5 stars, Storkcraft - 0

We purchased the crib, armoire, &amp; dresser w/ tower &amp; it took 5 wks for this to be shipped to us. Once we received it, we opened it only to find that each box contained 2-3 severely  cracked pieces. After inspecting them, we found that the dmg wasn't caused by packaging but, poor craftsmanship. Most pieces were assembled using a nailgun &amp; some of the nails were even bent. The cracking stemmed from areas that had been nailed &amp; continued all the way up the piece of furniture. Had the co pre drilled the holes &amp; used screws instead, this would've never happended. Obviously it's "cheaper" to use nails instead of screws. We took pictures of the dmgs &amp; I wish I could  attach them to this review so you'd be able to see for yourself. There were also several areas inside the crib which weren't sanded properly &amp; would be a real hazard for little fingers b/c of splintering wood. It was advertised to be constructed of hardwoods, but in all actuality it's pine. When you think of hardwood, you expect oak or birch, not a softwood like pine. The tops of the furniture &amp; the drawer fronts were the only pieces that were solid wood. Everything else was particle board. Some of the solid wood pieces weren't even 1 piece of wood, but 3 &amp; they were glued together. We're currently trying to return this product for a full refund. We're also shopping last minute for replacement furniture w/ only 2 wks left before my due date. I would never purchase a another peice of furniture made by this company again.

We bought this product based on its testimonials and thought it would be the best choice for our new baby. While he had no problems using the Playtex Nursers, he ended up having a problem with Dr. brown's Natural Flow bottles. First off, they are a pain to clean. Each piece needs to be painstakenly washed (boiling the nipple, washing the bottle, and scrubbing each hole of the the insert and the reservoir.) It was certainly laborsome and time consuming. Anyhow, when he uses them, he spits up where he didn't with the competition. I tried to figure out why. If you tip the bottle over it drips constantly without any sucking. So my baby is not sucking or swallowing when he uses this product. He lets it build up in his mouth and then ends up having to push it out when he has gotten too much. Needless to say, we are planning to return these and will stick with Playtex

I would not reccomend this product. It was cheaper at Amazon.com than walmart, but It took forever to get. It took two weeks for us to get it. When caption said ships 5-7 days. Than when we did get it, several pieces were broken. Major pieces. When I called the company, (which I was on hold for 30 minutes) then told me that we had so many pieces that were broken (5) that we needed to return it. I told them no, it's over 100 lbs and I am 7mth preg. they then changed the tune and said they would ship the parts they would be here in 4 weeks. Another mth. So  it took almost 2 mths to get this product. It is not worth the problems. Plus, nothing was labeled, and you had to figure out what pieces were what. Plus, the shelves inside the unit are WHITE, the armoire is natural but the shelves inside are white. I called the company and they said this is true.

We were so excited to try a jumper for our son, but were very dissapointed in this product. First of all, he tipped himself right out of it!  With the three strap design, it's unsturdy in the back, which we discovered after he spilled himself onto the floor. He seemed pretty intent on jumping, so now we've tried stuffing him in there with a blanket so that he's nice and snug, but it's still unstable and wobbly. I don't recommend this product, and in fact, we are going to try a different brand

I was going to order this backpack but wanted to try it out first. I went to a local store with a friend and tried this thing out. The sternum strap would not even snap over my chest...I have an average build but have a chest....and it would'nt reach. My friend tried it also and had the same problem. I would suggest that if you are interested in this carrier you find one and try it on first or it could be a costly mistake

Reasons why I do not like this potty:

1) The shield falls off with one touch, ussually into the potty!
2) The potty has many cracks and crevices in the bottom that collect pee in numerous ways.
3) It is cumbersome to empty the potty.
4) Once the shield is lost (since it impossible to keep attached) it is hard for boys to sit down and not make a mess.

I highly recommend that Bjorn potty since it is all one piece and with a built in shield

Though this potty is nicely priced, it's worth it to buy a more expensive one.  Though mine hasn't fallen apart like other reviewers, it does shift around on the base, allowing for spillage.  The removeable receptacle in the base is way too far from the actual seat, so my daughter gets stuff ALL OVER the inside, not just in the receptacle.  The inside has a criss-crossed honeycomb type pattern(see my customer image)so it's impossible to clean messes out of it.  It does serve it's purpose as a potty, but I'm definatly going to buy a different one when my son is old enough for one

I got this potty for my baby shower.  I registered for it because it was Safety first and most of their products are excellent.  I set it out to introduce it to my son( he was just beginning to show interest not ready to actually start yet).  We never actually used it since the top of the seat and I mean the entire top kept falling off even with nobody sitting on it.  Even if you just moved the potty it would fall apart.
Instead we bought a plain potty seat by Graco and it is excellent!

I hate, hate, hate this potty!  The shield will not stay on.  My son sits on the potty and either the shield falls off into the potty or he grabs it and hands it to me saying "here you go".  It is also cumbersome to get the bowl out of the potty to empty.  There is a lot of open space under the seat that gives bacteria a great chance to grow even with frequent cleaning.  Maybe this would work for a little girl but it is a no-go for a little boy

I purchased this baby carrier for my 1-month-old son.  When I put him in it, he looked so uncomfortable.  I tried putting a blanket in there underneath him to prop him up a bit, but it still covered his face.  So, I decided to shell out the $[...] for the infant support pillow, expecting that to make a difference.  It didn't.  He still looked uncomfortable and squished, only now I wasted MORE money. My son is 21 1/2 inces and 11 lbs 4 oz.  I can't imagine how a bigger baby could fit in this at all.  A big disappointment.  If you're looking for a carrier, try the Bjorn.  A million times better than this

I've tried this sling about 4 times with my now 10 week-old son.  I just can't get it to work so that he seems comfortable.  He usually cries when he is in it.  He fell asleep in it once, but he looked so contorted.  It's just so tight against my body that it bends him the wrong way.  And the pocket is so deep it closes over his head. And I know I got the correct size. I've given up and am looking for a better sling.  Right now we use our baby bjorn several times a day, and he loves it, but it's a little cumbersome, and I want him to be able to recline.

Rather than this sling... I recommend you check out [...] for your sling.  They are hand made based on your body size and come in a variety of colors.  This is a far better buy than the native baby carrier

When my daughter was tiny, she enjoyed being in this sling... on the one or two occasions I managed to endure the discomfort of wearing it for more than two minutes. The cotton fabric doesn't offer much support for the baby's weight and I found it became uncomfortable very quickly. It also didn't feel as secure as some of the padded, over-the-shoulder style slings. I actually was afraid not to keep an arm on my baby at all times, which defeats the purpose.

This sling was only useful for a couple months because there is no adjustable strap. There are so many slings out there that are more functional and that you can use from newborn to toddle

I'm going to buy a new car seat even though my 12 mo. old son weighs 28 lbs. and should be able to stay in it for alot longer (up to 40 lbs.). The straps are let all the way out and it's still too tight for him. I wouldn't recommend this car seat for chunky babies.

and had problems with it from the beginning. The cover was ripped where the the plastic clips were attached. Evenflo did replace it after I sent pictures. The shade protector doesn't stay up. I had a mother stop me in a store and warn me that the handle on hers broke while her husband was carrying her daughter. I wish I had checked safety ratings and reviews before I purchased this product.

The only good thing I can really say about this seat is that it comes in pink. It's hard to find carseats that are not really ugly. Otherwise I cannot take my newborn out without help because this seat does not recline far enough back and her head flops forward. I will be returning to work in a  couple of weeks and will be bringing her with me (I'm a nanny) I don't know how we are going to do it and may have to purchase a new seat already. I would think that if something is deemed an "infant"' carseat it should work correctly and safely from birth not from when the baby can hold their head up

I loved the idea that this car seat was. Then after I bought it I have had problems with it. The handle realse has broken many times. Then the gray handle part  has came apart also. This is has not been safe at all. I went to return it and Target would not return or exchange it for me. I think it was a waste of money

The product is flimsy, the step is too close to the toilet to be practical for a child to step up on, the deflector is not tall enough to deflect any urine, and the seat is too large for a toddler.  My child does not feel comfortable using this potty

The idea is good...but it does not sit well on oblong toilets. The adjustable step is a great feature as my sons feet could not reach the other step stools we have used before we bought this apparatus.
Would recommend with round toilet only

The Freedom potty trainer looked like such a good idea, but the plastic is very flimsy, and when set in place, it just barely reaches the floor. It's a pretty unstable situation. A separate kids toilet seat and footstool would be far better

It's not just the most icredible piece of junk I ever seen, it is the most DANGEROUS piece of junk I ever seen on the market for kids.
The plastic is very thin, very weak and bends every each way. My daughter weighs 35 pounds and the step almost collapsed under her weight. Is SLIDES off the toilet bowl and the seat itself also bends down under the child's weight, which really frightened my girl.
 There's no way a child should use it without an adult actually lifting it and putting it on the seat. 

I feel soooo stupid to have bought it((

I bought this chair when my husband was working out of state as a consultant. I wanted a portable chair that my son could use in the hotel room to eat, watch TV, or drink his sippy cup. This chair was the perfect height, design, and was compact enough to fit in my suitcase without being too bulky. The problem is that it broke on the trip back from our first trip. The fault is in a joint. I bought a second chair and on the next trip kept it the box when I packed. But then my son stood on the chair and the same joint broke in two. That joint is really weak. Too bad! It's such an adorable product

We got this as well as a car seat bag with wheels. I was not going to pay $200 for a car seat/stroller combo, so we picked 2 alternatives. I was hoping that the Traveling Toddler would be great, but I found that it too much torque and stress on the suitcase. To add the weight of my car seat (a Britax) and my 22 pound 1 year old was just too much weight for the handle of the suitcase. It felt awkward and unstable. The physics of it just did not work. So, we put the seat in a bag with wheels and dragged it behind us. The bag was also better for our trip because we fly stand-by and wait and see what seats are left. There was no more window seats available on one of our flights, so we gate checked the seat and I was happy to know that it was protected

I got these when my son was 12 months old and already a strong little guy who enjoyed dumping his bowls of food onto his high chair tray.  Trying to outsmart him, I purchased these hoping to keep some food in a bowl.  Much to my disappointment, they only stick to the formica countertops well.  The littlest one doesn't even stick to that.  None of them stays on my son's plastic high chair tray for more than a second or two.

On the upside, the lids are secure once shut all the way (which can take a little work), so they make great storage for on-the-go finger foods in the diaper bag...I haven't had one leak yet, and I put things like applesauce in them to test them.  Not a total waste of money, now that I found this alternate use.  They wash well, without any noticeable breakdown of the plastic, on the top rack of the dishwasher

I was very excited to get these bowls in the mail because they are so cute, and the concept of having a suction bowl was (and is) appealing to me. My son loved the bowl right away, as he was able to reach into the bowl for some puffs to feed himself instead of having to push the puffs around the table until he could finally grab one in his fingers. I'd also like to add that he ate tofu cubes for the first time out of this bowl and loved them! However, I'm disappointed because the suction on the bowl does not work for more than a few seconds. I'm constantly pushing the bowl back down, which is disruptive to his meal. Despite some of happy memories I've had with this bowl, I would not recommend buying these bowls because as 'suction bowls' they do not serve their purpose

I tried my new bowls out this morning and was very disapointed. The suction won't stay down for more than a second or two on our wood table. On the kitchen counter top(formica) they stay put for longer but not long enough for a meal.
I am returning mine to the store today. Dissapointing.
BUT, they are darling colors and the lids are a nice feature

I agree that the water holder is a bit tedious to fill and measure acurately. I always follow the measuring instructions, but sometimes the bottle is too cool or too hot, even though I have been practicing to get it right. I wish it were more accurate and for someone like me, who only has a 3 room apartment, the cooling feature is not that useful

I agree with all the other reviews saying the warmer with burn your hands and overheat the bottle. Especially when you only have a few oz in the bottle. The water in the warmer actually BOIL when it heats up and if the bottle got stuck in the handle, it means you have to use your bare hands to separate the boiled bottle and the boiled handle. You end up having a boiled hand as well. The worst part is it will burn your love one....

Not only that, the cooler does not close well so the content will not really be kept fresh even the ice-pack is frozen before placing into the cooler. We switched to AVENT warmer. A little more $$ but it is much better. I would NOT recommend this product

WHAT TO DO IF YOU JUST BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT: Go outside and bang your head as hard as you can against the side of your house---Maybe that will knock some sense into you after you've gone looney trying to use this piece of junk!!! As many reviewers have noted, it is extremely difficult to get this bottle warmer to work properly.
First off, the little vials you use to measure the water into are poorly marked -- Why did they choose to use teeny-tiny WHITE lettering? STUPID! It is then very tricky to get the proper amount of water into the vials. In fact the difference between say, level 2 and level 3 is maybe two drops of water! Trying doing that out of a standard faucet. In fact we use a filtered water faucet (with a thin spout) and it is still hard to get write.
But that's easy compared to figuring out the right water-in-the-vial to formula-in-the bottle ratio! We are currently using a 4oz Playtex bottle (with the disposable bags) and are contantly playing a guessing game as to the right amount of water to use. Level 3--- still to cold, but wait, last night that same amount of water practically scalded the formula! And just try to use a vented-type bottle...Forget it! How about an 8oz. bottle? NO WAY! Either way to cold or way to hot.
And even though we use filtered water, this thing still need to be cleaned with vinegar (as recommended) evey week or so. However, the cleaning barely hepls and after less than 8 weeks of use we now use the microwave more and more. Why? Because we know that 4oz. of formula will always need 6-7 seconds in the microwave...Every time

I've heard some say this is the best warmer available.  If so, parents are S.O.L. Heating is SO inconsistent. Same amount of water with the same amount of milk will produce a different temperature every single time.  Sometimes way too cold and sometimes way too hot. When the heating indicator light turns off you must be right there to pull the bottle out or it will continue to significantly warm the bottle without any water medium.  Be sure to loosen your bottles cap during heating and check to see that the travel disc is not in place.  Otherwise, the bottles (esp. Brown's) will overflow.  If that happens cleaning the inside of the warmer is a major hassle because the milk will have burned onto the heating plate. The carrier is too short for Mr. Brown 8oz. bottles or any other of similar height. The tubes provided to premeasure water are a joke. The caps are so hard to close and open you need two really strong hands and maybe multiple tools to shut or flip the tops open.  Of course, you will likely be holding your crying and squirming baby in one arm while trying to do open the cap and not spill all the water. They tried to get fancy with the shape of the tubes and cap they forgot to make them easy to use.I just can't believe that someone can't design a better "mouse trap".
To add insult to injury, the taps on the handle that are supposed to hold the top of the bottle storage compartment just broke off...

After reading all the rave reviews, we put Pupsqueak on our Baby's registry, but were very disappointed when we received one as a gift and he didn't work. We tried exchanging him for another one at Babies R Us, but we couldn't find one that worked. So instead we exchanged him for the Dinosaur (I forget his name). Our daughter loves him. Since he's soft we are not afriad with placing him in her car seat with her. She loves falling asleep holding onto Mr. Dyno

I bought this car seat based on the good ratings it received.  However, it did not work for my son until he was about 5 months old.  My son was born 5 lb. 11 oz.  He did not fit snugly into this seat, even with the head cushion.  His head rolled around or rolled forward.  I tried to put washcloths or towels around but it did not work.  Also, if I adjust the base so that the car seat is flatter, it would roll around a lot more (I have leather seats). Additionally, the material on the seat is not breathable--it is velvety--so my son's back and head would become very sweaty on longer trips, even in the winter.  I would say that once my son was bigger (about 14 pounds and 26 inches), I removed the head cushion and moved the seat belt to the higher position--this is when he actually "fit" into the seat, however the fabric is still an issue and his back and head still become very sweaty, making him very uncomfortable for longer trips.

I received this seat as a gift for my baby shower, I thought it was going to be a great seat, Graco has been on the market for several years, and it's built up a reputation. But was I wrong! Everytime that I would go out with my newborn, and I would make a turn, the seat would flip over to the side, it did not matter how slow I made the turn it would always do the same thing. I'm a very carefull driver, specially after I gave birth to my son. You can't imagine how horrible it is, to look throuhg the rearview mirror, and see that your tiny little precious bundle of joy, has flipped over and his head is hanging. I would have to look for a place to park, and have to fix him and the seat. I had to move both the passenger and the driver seat as far back as possible, in order to hold the baby seat with the backrest, just so that it wouldn't tip over, and it made it a little difficult to drive.
You might say, she probably didn't install it well, but you would be wrong, it was perfectly installed, I had someone check the installation in my city, and everything was fine. The base of the seat is not completely flat, making it difficult for the seat to stay in place. This did not just happen to me, it also happened to my sister with her baby's seat, we had our children with a few weeks difference.
I had to get a different seat, I purchased one with a flatter base, and that one worked perfectly. I will never buy another Graco seat again, I believe it's worth spending more money on a better seat, I believe ones children are priceless, and investing money in their safety

I bought this carseat (different color) because I liked the features.  However, everytime I put my now 5 week old in the seat his head plops forward.  I have tried everything, from putting a diaper or towel around his head because the headrest sucks, to trying to push the base down so it doesn't sit up so high. Do you know how nerve wrecking it is to be driving just to look back and see you newborn's head ploped forward so bad that he is choking.  Not good Graco, this carseat could not have been tested before.  I had an Evenflo with my previous child and did not have this problem.  I am truly disappointed.  Can anyone could tell me how to make this problem go away, I am all ears.  I know the seat is right because the balance window is all blue.  I have talked to other mothers and they have the same problem.  HELP!!!

I bought this doll because at the expensive price, I figured it would be the best.  It definitely is not.  Patty is cute, but that is the only good thing about her.  To fill up her bottles, you must squeeze and insert into a glass of water, then squeeze again until water shoots out and then reinsert into the glass of water again.  It requires it to be done in such a particular way that only an adult can fill the bottles with water, no small child will be able to master the precise way it takes.  Then, to feed Patty you must hold her very still at an exact angle, where she is almost standing up.  Most children cradle their baby dolls in their arms, but Patty will not drink in that position.  Even in the standing up position, most of the water spills out of the tiny hole for her mouth and soaks her outfit.  It takes 5-10 minutes to fill Patty up.  Most children don't have the patience for this and lose interest, as my daughter did.  Plus since she has to be perfectly still and at an exact angle, only an adult can feed Patty her water.  Then, to make her pee, you must press her thigh very hard.  This distressed my daughter because she thought I was hurting Patty.  Once I assured her Patty was ok, then she was upset because she was not strong enough to press hard enough to make Patty pee.  My daughter is 35 months old and a lot of children start training earlier.  At 35 months old, my daughter was not able to fill the bottles, feed Patty or make her pee.  Only an adult can do these things due to the complexity of the bottles and feeding and peeing systems of Patty.  So my daughter quickly lost interest in Patty and started squirting water all over the bathroom instead with the bottles.  The whole "teach the doll to pee" part of the potty training was lost.  I wish I had gone to the store and bought a cheap wetting doll instead.  Then I e-mailed the company to complain, but of course received no response.  And you can't get a full refund if the doll has been used.  In fact, getting a refund at all is extremely difficult, I have just given up on that.  Don't waste your money.  This doll is too expensive and cannot be used by a child, which defeats the whole purpose.  Go to your toy store and buy a cheap wetting doll.  At least that way, if you don't like it you can return it, unlike Patty

Same thing that happened to the previous poster happened to my son's toy.  The turtle cup came off after the first use (and within 20 min!).  My son is 8 months old and it can't even withstand the pulling of an 8 month old.  And a sharp screw is revealed when the cup comes off.  Luckily we noticed it before my son was injured, unfortunately I had to remove it immediately which of course upset my son, who no longer had his toy to play with.  I would pay more for something that is quality so it is sad and amazing that companies put out cheap quality products that break immediately and expose dangerous parts.  I would recommend that you do not buy this item.  I now have to waste more time returning it to the store

I bought this toy bar for my second child and absolutely loved it at first.  My daughter loves to play and chew on the toys and it keeps her totally entertained for trips to the mall or doctor.  It fits beautifully on my Graco Quattro Tour stroller.  The big drawback is the turtle snack cup came off, revealing a screw, which scratched my daughters arm.  I feel Sassy needs to recall this item and make some adjustments.  The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the potential hazard of the cup coming off

After only 2 months this toy fell apart. My daughter loves the toys on it but the turtle fell off and a metal screw was popping out and the snail's threads came out and the stuffing our of the side started to come out of the seams. $20 is not cheap for this toy and I think the quality should have been alot better

These come in both boy and girl colors. The picture shows pink, purple, and yellow bottles. I received blue and green bottles. I contacted Amazon who promptly sent me another three sets (all of the first three sets were wrong). In the second shipment they only got one set right. I e-mailed to return these as well. When I sent back the five incorrect sets the company would not refund my money because "they had already replaced the items". Be careful when ordering from this site

My son is ten days old. I tried these bottles and was highly disappointed. The liners are a pain in the butt. Once you prepare the bottle and get the air out of it, if your child does not drink the whole bottle it collects air again. I changed to Dr. Brown's bottles and my son is having less gas and isn't wearing his food.

So...I bought this for our 7 month old.  What a nightmare.  What the previous posters said about this thing is TRUE.  It is hard to get it to STAY PUT in the cart while you put your kid in it. It just doesn't happen.  And then...when you DO get your baby in, the seat portion is so narrow that it barely is the width of your child's hind end.  Forget the bar cover.  It is just as narrow.  This thing covers just that small area and if you have a child like mine, they are reaching over and touching EVERYTHING.  To add to it, the back cusion part doesn't even go up to the top of the back support.  My daughter totally whacked her head on the back of the cart seat and screamed.  The cusion part totally doesn't cover it.  

Just bad.  Just spend the extra cash and buy something that covers the whole darn cart

This is o.k. if you're using it as a restraint only.  If you want it to protect your child from the germs on the cart, forget it.  I thought the bar cover would keep my baby from touching and chewing on the bars, wrong.  It hardly covers anything.  I went back and bought the cart cover that covers everything, I wish I would have spent the extra money before wasting it on this seat

I bought this after renting the hospital-grade Medela Lactima.  Big difference.  The backpack is compact, sleek, and inconspicuous but the pump sucks.  It has one adjustment for speed/suction and a computer chip that selects the best combination of the two for you.  Well, after a few pumps my nipples are about to fall off.  If I lower the suction to a comfortable, reasonable level, the pump is way too fast.  If I slow the pump to mimic MY baby's speed, the suction is excruciatingly painful--and it still doesn't pump slow enough.  I am very unhappy with this and wish we'd just rented the hospital-grade for a year instead.  

The little cooler is cute, but it's tough to actually fit the frozen insert ("blue" plastic thing) AND four bottles in there.  And it is convenient for the horns to pump directly into standard-size bottles (it will pump into Dr. Browns &amp; Evenflo bottles too, any regular mouth size bottles) or bags.  

I love the setup, just wish the pump had slower speed settings and that the speed &amp; suction were truly adjustable and independent from each other.  I can't be in pain like this all the time and am looking for other options.  :(

I have been using my medela pump for the past 5 months( first couple of months intermittently and the last 2 1/2 months daily). Suddenly it broke down without any warning signs on a weekend. My dealer was not open to replace it and this has caused a considerable loss of milk supply in me. Thankfully the dealer was a local dealer and very good. He replaced "just the pump" in the pack with a new one. 
Per Medela's instructions, they actually want to send the broken pump over to them and they will take care of it, if it was under a yr old. It would have been very late for me if I were to ship it and they have to ship it back. 
Another thing that is happening is my back pack's handles have started wearing down. And I hardly carry them around.
I am giving it a 1 star because of the poor quality check that must have been carried out for such an expensive pump.
I would think twice before buying this

I'm very dissappointed with this expensive pump. Now I'm looking for another one. It's difficult to pump if you have large nipples. You have to buy extra sheild which costs extra. It's noisy. It loses suction.The milk backs up to the tubing and gets moldy.I clean the parts everyday. I have contacted Medela a few times to troubleshoot the pump and they eventually sent me another motor (great customer service). It worked for a few months and now the same problem is happening. I guess it works for some and not others. Now I'm in the hunt for another pump since I want to exclusively give my baby pure breastmilk for her first year.

Initially, I thought these angled bottles make a lot of sense so I put different sizes into our registry. However, when our baby girl (1 week old) first tried to suck the milk out from the bottle, it did not come out. My husband had activated the vent and did everything according to the instructions. He thought the holes were not big enough since he did not see any on the nipple, so he put more holes on them but still nothing came out. He finally found out the way that these bottles work are not the same as a traditionally bottle does. The hole will not open unless pressure is applied against it and hole will get sealed back again when released. Baby has to use their tongue to push against the nipples in order to open up the hole. For a newborn infant, it is too difficult for them to figure out how to get the milk out especially if you are bottle feeding only. Luckily we had two Avent bottles (with the traditionally hole idea) so she is doing very well with the Avent bottles and she still loves them a lot. We ended up returning the unused VentAir bottles and got a lots of AVENT bottles but still stuck with the opened ones. I do not recommend these 'difficult' bottles for newborn. Baby should not need to 'think' how to get the milk out.

For leaking problem, we do not have any issue with the Avent bottles. When it leaks, it is usually because the nipples have not been properly placed (push all the way though the ring) or the ring has not been tightly screwed. We also found out if you use a warmer to warm the bottle, you have to unscrew the ring once and screw it all tight again after the warmer. It is because the theory of heat with expense the plastic bottle which creates a gap between the ring, nipples and the bottle neck. This works 99% for us with no leak.

We are the fans of the AVENT bottles.

Like you, I read all the reviews I could of bottles, travel systems, baby swings, cribs, etc etc etc.  I loved the shape of these bottles (very handy when needing your hand - you can prop the bottle under your chin while feeding), and the concept of the "ventaire" system made a lot of sense!  HOWEVER, 2 months into using these bottles, I became FED up with having to wash all of the different parts, drying them thoroughly (it's a MUST with these things), and having to "activate" BOTH the nipples and the ventaire plastic seal; wasting valuable time and energy that should've been spent with my family, catching up on laundry, cleaning the house, cooking, and grabbing naps in-between (I also work a full-time job and didn't get home till 6 PM every night).  The WORST of all of it is that if you don't install the vent juuuuuuust so, it leaks...the person (below) who said it doesn't leak if you screw it on right, hasn't met me - I'm 34 years old and DO believe I have learned how to screw on a stupid cap!  It's a "hit or miss" deal...sometimes I would go a whole week without a leak and then OUT of the blue...water EVERYWHERE!!! (and they're slow leaks too, so it's not like you would notice right away...it took like 30 minutes before showing)  Then I called Playtex to ask them what the problem was, and they thought my water might be too hot and breaking down the material...so, they kindly sent me some new ones.  Well, yeh, THAT didn't work either!!!  It is a GREAT idea, but VERY bad design!!!  I finally threw my hands in the air...and purchased Evenflo's version of the "angled bottle" and now I am in HEAVEN!!!  Do yourself, and your time, a favor and don't waste the money

I chose this bottle system for my son after reading so many great reviews, and even bought one and ran it through the dishwasher to test for leaks...no leaks...They worked well, UNTIL recently.  My son is 4 months old and they all LEAK. Constantly. I fill one up to put it in the diaper bag and within a half hour it's empty. They aren't very durable, the plastic on the rings is actually breaking off and now I'm going through the struggle of trying to find a new bottle system that my son will take (I hate the liners)...And they never did reduce the amount of air in the bottle at all.  Do not buy these bottles unless you want to buy a completely new system in 4 months

I bought these for my daughter thinking that maybe they wouldn't leak like the last ones I had used.  They don't leak, but the stage 1 is TOO slow and frustrates her.  She's 5 months and the stage 2 is TOO fast.  They made a HUGE mistake in not making more stages.  Had I realized this before I had used them, I would have taken them all back

I thought this cover was horrible.  It doesn't cover enough area of the cart.  It's difficult to put on because of all the ties.  I couldn't even get the harness to fit right.  Try one of the other seat covers instead that have elastic, you can put them on the cart with one hand, and it completely covers the cart, even the big ones at Costco

You don't want this one.  Although the fabric is appealing (calm stripes vs. the buzy themes of the other covers) this cover will not fit most shopping carts.  It only fits the carts found at small city super markets.  If you are a suburbian shopper you'll have to spend the bucks for  a more satisfactory product

I bought this cover thinking that anything to cover the cart would be the same.  Other covers I've seen just slip on, this one has to be tied on.  Also, it doesn't cover the entire cart.  There is an opening, that my baby's fingers always find, where he can touch the icky cart handle.  Not a great product.  Spend the extra money and buy the better one

This product serves its purpose, but does not need to cost almost $30!  Basically, it's a foam wedge with white mesh fabric over it. I'm sure you can find the same product that performs as well, if not better, if you take the time to look

I received this after much debate about the prior review. Had seen this item described the same on other web sites and figured it had to be an error for the other customer. So I bought it and sure enough had the same problem. Amazon was great, they sent me a replacement and still the same problem. My baby is due any day so I am keeping the first one, but sending back the replacement. It doesnt come as described, no blanket included, and I dont see how you could adjust the wedge. I am very disappointed with the product, but happy about Amazon's willingness to assist in the issue.

I just received this sleep positioner today and it is nothing like what I expected.  The description makes it sound like the wedge is adjustable - but I don't quite get how to adjust this.  It also says that there is a blanket.  Maybe I misunderstood the description because there is no blanket here.  I imagined the wedge would prop the baby up much more than it does.  At the thickest layer the wedge is MAYBE 2 1/2 inches thick.  I'm pretty disappointed.  I thought this was going to be the answer to my baby's sleep problems

1) Like others here, my charges do not last more than 5 hours.  The beeping from the parent unit WILL wake you at about 3am every night (unless you leave them on the charger).

2) Both of my parent units now (after only two weeks of minor useage) refuse to connect with the nursery unit, beeping endlessly.  "Cycling" them on and off per the prescribed (though not well detailed) manufacturer's trouble-shooting method has done nothing.  Only logical conclusion: the nursery unit has apparently died and is not sending out a signal.

Also: while they were working I did not really get the hype these units generated.  My home is a very common 1800 square feet of two-story "box" type arrangement.  The static would become unbearable once the parent unit was taken downstairs and (maybe due to a weak or faulty nursery unit from the get-go), the signal would cut out before we even got to the kitchen.  So we either got static or no signal at less than 50 linear feet from the nursery.

Poorly designed (operator interface, controls, directions and trouble-shooting), poorly engineered (poor reception, enormous static, fast battery drain) and poorly manufactured (apparent faulty parts and lack of quality) product

I bought the dual room iMonitor yesterday. (only available in store at Babies R Us).  It is the same as the one shown here, but it has two transmitters to montor two children.  Based on only 4 hours of testing, I am taking the unit back.  

Pro:
-The range was great.  Whole house, plus 800ft outside.
-No interference.  I live in a dense suburban area with many sources of interference.
-Easy to setup.
-Shape/size of parent units are much better than others (especially sony)
Cons:
-Controls are not very straightforward.
-The unit always hisses.  It is not sound/voice activated.
-The power switch on the parent unit is a button that is not recessed.  When you turn it off, it does not beep or let you know that you did.  The button is easy to bump, and would make it easy to carry the thing while it is off, and you think it is on.
-The DEAL BREAKER: a power outage requires turns off child units.  With even a short power interruption, the child units come up in the "off" mode.  You have to go to the baby's room and turn them on.  Until you do, the parent unit will beep and flash red.

We have been using the Sony 910 for 3 years with our first child.  I guess it has spoiled us

My wife and I purchased this baby monitor in preparation for the arrival of our first child, and after using it for almost 2 weeks I could not be more disappointed.  We were drawn in by the promise of a clear connection that would prevent others from listening in, but the many drawbacks far outweigh this one advantage.  

This is one of the more expensive and highly rated baby monitors, but you certainly don't get what you pay for here.  

Pros:

1.  You do get a clear connection when the unit is in range (see cons for a further explanation)

Cons:

1.  The biggest complaint I have is the battery life.  Even with the parent units on the lowest volume setting, you will not get more than 5 hours of use without having to recharge.  You will know when you need to recharge because the unit will start beeping loudly every 5 seconds until you put it back in the cradle to recharge.  This is a great feature to discover during the middle of the night.  The nursery unit is even worse, as it does not take rechargeable batteries and will eat through 3 AAA batteries in 6 hours unless it is plugged in.  Why they even allow this unit to operate without being plugged in is beyond me.  Basically all of the units have to be plugged in at all times.

2.  I have already had a couple instances where the parent units will simply not connect to the nursery unit.  They just sit there and beep like they do if you are out of range.  This required a couple of off/on power cycles of the nursery and parent units to correct.

3.  The range is not ideal.  I have a 2800 square foot, 2 story house and we have already had 1 issue where the parent unit would not connect to the nursery unit.  Granted, the units were about as far away as they can be in our house, but considering this distance was only about 60 feet, I do not think it is unreasonable to have complete coverage in our house.

4.  As other reviewers have noted, the lowest volume setting can be too loud if you are a light sleeper.  Since the speaker is always on, you will hear any ambient noise in the room amplified and played on the parent unit.  Several other monitors on the market have noise thresholds and will only transmit the sound if it is above a certain volume (i.e. if the baby is crying as opposed to shifting in the crib).  Also the LEDs are also extremely bright in a dark room.  

Unfortunately I cannot recommend this product.  We are making due with it simply because I refuse to throw away a $100 baby monitor, although I'm sure I would be much happier with a different product.  

If you can deal with leaving the units plugged in at all times and only taking the parent units out of the cradle for short periods of time, then this product would probably suffice, although I'm sure you could find a much cheaper product that would work just as well

I am so unhappy and fustrated with these monitors.  The battery only lasts about 5 hours off the charging base so I can't make it through the whole night without it beeping due to low battery.  And it doesn't just beep once - it beeps and beeps and beeps until you do something about it.  I have to keep it on the charger all night so it doesn't go out.  There is tons of static and extra noise.  Also, the belt clip is not tight - the monitor always falls off of my belt if I bend down to much.  Just super dissapointed with these monitors - ABSOLUTELY NOT worth its big price tag!!  Please look elsewhere - DO NOT recommend!

I have never written a review, but in this case, I feel compelled to do so. I purchased the iMonitor last week as an upgrade to a Safety 1st dual monitor, for no other reason than I was tired of the interference. I was excited to learn of the digital technology, and once I got it home, I was anxious to try it. After a few nights trying it out, I was equally as anxious to return it and get my money back...let me explain:
To begin with, before you buy, please be aware that the lights and sound are awfully bright and loud, which was troublesome since I am a light sleeper. I would have been able to deal with it, but there are other problems as well...there are 'clicks' and 'crackles' that are intermittent, and, like I said before, not good for a light sleeper. 
The final straw was on the fourth night the parent receivers lost contact with the base -- I spent a half hour resetting it, reconfiguring the layout, powering on/off -- all to no avail. It kept beeping 'Out of Range' -- I was only 10 feet from the monitor at the time. Absolutely unacceptable. 
In all fairness, we do have a lot of gadgets that are wireless and may have been competing with the monitor, but that isn't an excuse..it says 'Crystal Clear Clarity' and '2000 foot range', but this is not, I repeat, NOT the case.
So, I packed it back up and went into Babies R Us to return it...here's the kicker: The salesperson at the store said that she agreed they had a lot of problems and she has seen more of the iMonitors returned than any other monitor. She rec'd the Sony, but it doesn't come with two parent units, so I have resigned myself to living with the Safety 1st..even with all of its interference, it is still superior, and 1/4 of the price as the iMonitor. 
I have no doubt that Digital is the next step in baby monitors...but so far Graco does not have it figured out...Save your money and give it some time so they can work out the obvious flaws in the system.

We have the Graco Ultra Clear monitor and it has worked really well for us for over 3 years.  With a new baby on the way, we thought we'd upgrade to the new technology.  Oops.  It turns out that the range on the new monitor was about half that of the Ultra Clear (couldn't even make it to the other side of the house), and the reception was quite poor.  And the annoying beeping was the clincher.  I sent it back today and bought another $40 Ultra Clear.  Oh, and I tried the Fisher Price Private Connection also, and had the same issues..

This is a kick piano, not a hand piano and as such it needs to be mounted in a baby's crib.  We thought it would be useable if we just held the piano in place for our daughter to kick, or for her to use her hands on the keys - it isn't.  As we use her crib for sleeping, not playing, this has been a total waste of money.  
At 10 months my daughter is now able to sit and press the keys on the piano with her hands, but the response of the keys isn't instant and the noise is so soft that she doesn't recognise that she's making it work.  Her sister's toy xylophone with twice the number of keys, an obvious sound and an instant response to her touch is far easier and far more satisfying for her to use

I purchased this sterilizer about two weeks ago, and I have used it all of two times. It creates a horrible mess with water running everywhere when the lid is lifted, and I really had to wonder if the bottles were actually sterilized. I am terribly disappointed with this product, and truly caution those of you who are thinking of buying this to run from it like the wind

It does leave mineral deposit on the bottles even if you use distilled water. It is worse if you use tap water. It doesn't help if you clean it with vinegar after each use as is directed.
When you lift the cap all the water drip. You will need a lot of towels to clean the water after each use.
The plastic lid of this product is not appropiate because it gets soft from the heat. You wonder if it is going to melt. 
I am a fan of Gerber products, but this one does not work

I got this to make sterilizing easier. I'm not sure it does. It is kind of a pain. Cartoonish in appearance, cheap looking, cheap feeling,not nearly enough room for what you have to put in, you have to use a glass or something to hold the small things. Water does spill like crazy from the lid. Does it really sterilize? I hope so! I can't tell. Air vent bottles air dry, but one piece bottles will not dry no matter how long left out on the bottle drainer I have. Why? I don't know, the steam? Metal of heating unit isn't smoothed by company so be careful when cleaning you don't get cut! I was VERY disappointed! For that amount of money I should have gotten something of better quality! You pulled a fast one on us with this to be sure!

Both my children get Thrush very easy so I purchased this product to sterilize the bottles and nipples with every use. My kids still get thrush and this product is terribly messy and the bottle look horrible afterwards. If my kids keep getting thrush, obviously this product does not work

We just learned in Parenting class (and I checked with my pediatrician) that you don't need to sterlize bottles, nipples or anything else now as long as you have a dishwasher. So save some money and don't get this!

I received this steralizer as a gift. If I had to do all over again I would have never put it on my registry. The steralizer is messy; everytime I lift the top to remove the bottles water is everywhere. In addition I have to keep a dry towel under the steralizer to dry up the water that spills out... there has to be a better way

I was given this as a gift, so thankfully I didn't waste my money on it.  This sterilizer is so messy and awkward, that I can not recommend it at all.  The metal pan started corroding after only a week.  Little flecks of metal and water soak the bottom of the unit and lifting off the cover will drench your countertop.  All the bottles and nipples and breastpump parts stay wet and spotty, so I can't imagine how it could possibly clean.  Horrible product

This is the worst nursing pad that I've tried.  It slips out of place, and the pad itself leaks after even the smallest amount of milk leaks into it.  I found myself with wet bras all the time!  These pads are terrible!  I recommend the Lansinoh brand.

These breast pads are sooooo different from the Johnson &amp; Johnson product.  They don't absorb your milk, which means it still gets all over your clothes.  The don't have adhesive, which means the pads move all over the place.  Generally, just a waste of money.  You might as well use toilet tissue :).

I received a box as a shower gift, and they worked okay, unless I changed them a lot though, they ended up leaking. I was resigned to just living with wet spots, until someone gave me some of the Lansinoh pads to try. I have no idea why Babies R Us doesn't arry them, but they really need to. These things absolutely do not leak, they hold tons of liquid

We own two of these and they have never been easy to use.  We tore holes in the first one trying to insert the seat.  We have kept it though.  We bought another and on our second trip the zippers broke off.  We would not buy this one again.  We do have large carseats - they are both Britax Marathons

Do not buy this mattress, it is not safe.  This mattress does not fit either of the cribs we have for our twins.  When I called Kolcraft to inform them, the CS rep was rude and insistent that this mattress was standard size and would fit, and that they haven't had any complaints.  She also implied it was my crib that was the wrong size.  We have 2 cribs and the sealy matress in the crib the twins still share fits nice and snug.  The Kolcraft has at least an inch gap and can move around quite easily

We are pregnant and our baby is due in two weeks.  We bought the mattress for our Delta Marisa White Crib, and (you guessed it) it doesn't fit.  I read the review of another poster here and it says it doesn't fit their Thomas The Tank Engine toddler bed. The poster assumed that it may fit a baby's crib, but the honest truth; its one inch (possibly more) off.  An inch is enough for our baby's foot to get stuck in it, and the mattress feels like a joke, its too cushiony.  We regret not reading the reviews before buying it.

If this mattress doesn't fit the majority of cribs/beds, then what is it good for

Due to the fact that you can't give 0 stars, I had to choose a 1, otherwise it would have been a big fat 0!!! We bought this mattress when I was pregnant, thinking that all crib mattresses were the same and we were totally wrong. A couple months ago my son poked a couple holes in the vinyl when he should have been napping, mind you he had nothing to use other than his fingers, no toys, nothing sharp, etc. Well last night he wakes up crying in the middle of the night, and my husband and I go in to see what is the matter, and find that the vinyl had split completely from side to side and the springs were sticking out. My poor little one had the springs poking at him. After further examination, we found that under the vinyl is a thin and I stress the word thin, layer of foam, then CARDBOARD piece and then the coils. What a joke!  Carboard!!!! Needless to say I went out today and bought him a much better, better constructed Simmons mattress. I should note my son is only 17 mths old, and the first five months of his life he never even slept on that mattress, so bascially he had only used it for 12 mths. Don't waste your money ....you'll only have to buy another one down the road. Take your money and buy a much better well known mattress for your baby!!! Afterall they deserve just as good a nights sleep as we do!!! 

From a mom who learned the hard way!

I just bought this seat for my 9 month old son. I bought it for the convenience of the fold down front. As good as that feature is it still causes red marks on my sons knees. He is a thin baby so I don't know how well this would work for a chubbier baby. Also, the seat it self is slippery. I have to place a rag down before I put the baby in because he will slide forward if I don't. This is very uncomfortable for him.Unfortunately, this seems to be the only seat with the fold down front which does make taking the baby in and out easier. That is really the only good thing I can say about this product.

I love how soft and cuddly this changing pad cover is.  I also appreciate how many colors it comes in.

What I am disappointed with is the durability.  I have 3 of these and have used them for just over a year.  They are totally falling apart at the elastic. Now, keep in mind that we use disposable "chucks" (those blue hospital disposable under pads) on top of this terry cloth changing pad.  It makes it less messy (especially early on) and doesn't require washing as much.  I also washed them in cold water with Baby Dreft detergent, hung them to dry and rotated the 3 covers that we have.  

While it is a nice product while it lasts, I just expected them to be more durable.

The first one of these I had came apart at every seam the first time I washed it.  I returned it and got another I was pleased with until about the 6th washing, and now IT is starting to fall apart.  They just don't seem to be well-made enough to stand up to the frequent washes that something like a changing pad cover will have to endure.

I really enjoy the colors that this cover comes in, however the quality of the material is less than desirable. The cover snagged in the washer and shrank quite a bit in the drier. I expected some shrinkage, but it seems excessive. I still use the covers but am disappointed overall. The material is not very soft so admittedly I will look around for other products

I have to say that I just 20 min ago recieved this cover in the mail, (I ordered online because I'm so far from a Babies R Us location) and I was excited at first. The color is great, and the cover fit perfectly, but I haven't washed it yet. Actually I have to return mine already because a manufacturer defect in the fabric. The fabric immediately shred along the elastic in one area(middle of long side). I plan to exchange this cover for another of the same, I hope for better luck with the next one, but man, the hassle of having to mail this back and sit and wait is just frustrating

Okay were to start. This car seat looks good on paper but that is it. When it arrived the box was completely smashed and the car seat already had a tear in it.If you have the LATCH system in your car you must find, and shove all the belts inside the seat.  Then pull them out the correct places.  Not so easy.  Then in order to attach it to the base you must pull out a metal bar and once the seat is attached, slide it back.  This is very hard.  So once there together it is a pain to take apart.

For facing backwards, if the seat is not level with your car seats, use a towel or blanket.  You shouldn't have to do that.  Plus with my baby in it his feet are still squished into the rear seat.  Once you turn it forward, to get the belts adjusted, you press a button on the bottom of the car seat and pull them towards you.  This would work fine if the BASE wasn't holding them so you CAN'T MOVE THEM.  We took the car seat off the base so we could adjust the belts.  What is the point of that.  

Once it is in your car the way you want it does suit it's purpose but I highly suggest buying something of better quality.

This carseat is hard to install with the booster still attached.  The fabric is very cheap, and it melted in the dryer.  I wash my carseats after every roadtrip, and it didn't even last one roadtrip before melting.  It ripped the day that I got it trying to adjust the straps.  I was very disappointed in this carseat.  I would not purchase it again.  I loved my previous carseats being the Alpha Omega, and a Graco.  If you are looking for something cheap this is the product. There are other products out there that are in the same price range that would be better manufactured.  Try those ones first.  This is an awful carseat.

I bought the Avent Breastshells because of my sore nipples, and a way to collect leaking milk while I was not nursing, and relieve some engorment.

1. It is very messy when removing the colleting cap
2. My nipples are still sore
3. And the only way to relieve engorment pain is to nurse or to pump

If I would have known about these factors I would not have purchased this product

Not wide enough for the shoulders of a 6 month old when in recline position. The wheels have a mind of their own. The handles make it hard to go up curbs. Hard to close up, need both hands and foot.

But can fit a Graco infant car seat, compact fold, and light

We ordered the double stroller because it had really good reviews and it sounded like it would fit us perefctly.
Our children are 2.5 and 10 months.  Our 2 year old has almost outgrown the back as her head is higher than the back support.  Also with in 6 months we had two different stollers because both has issues with the rain shield,and peek a boo window cracking, also the black out line seam came apart from the red fabric.  The kickers was when we pick up our stroller from from the airport in Mexico and the latch mechanism gave away when  my two kids were in it.  It cloapsed because the locking system melted..... oops, I guess someone forgot to check that on part of the test!!

But after ordering it twice from Amazon, and having both arrive either defective or damaged, I give up on this stroller. First one arrived and it turned out after assembly that the front fork was funky - one side longer than the other - therefore making it impossible for the wheel to sit correctly. So we returned it to Amazon and were sent a new one. It arrived in a horribly damaged box but we put it together anyway...put my almost 3 year old and 2 month old in it and tried it. Veered to the right, and after close inspection, once again we noticed that the front fork was messed up, probably during shipping. Also my 2 1/2 year old's head was brushing the top of the canopy and this stroller is VERY heavy and hard to turn. (yes I knew the front wheel would be fixed and had anticipated having to lift it to turn, etc.)
Too bad, I really wanted to like this stroller, but I just don't have much faith in the company anymore

The volume control on this is totally lame.  I can't get it quite enough to put on the crib for bedtime.  Also, the sound quality is poor in general.  I suppose it's OK for just playing in the room, but definitely not for bed.  You can probably get something with better sound quality for a comprable price

I bought this item on my own because I read the wonderful reviews it received. I really don't know HOW this item can be used. Even if you don't use the air-vented cups (which collect the leaking milk), you can plainly see the soft shells in loose clothing. I was wearing a sweater &amp; you could see the shape of the shells right through it. If you do use the cups they supply, you look absolutely abnormal. I guess this doesn't work for large-breasted women

We haven't yet put the bed together so it might be great but I gave it 2 stars because it should arrive intact but it didn't!  This was a common complaint in reviews.  Two of the main pieces were seriously scratched or chipped.  It did was definitely not damaged in shipping because it was packed well.  There is a phone number to call if parts are damaged.  We'll do that soon.  I'll update this review if everything is fixed

We received this item as a Xmas gift last year and within 4 months the legs have broken.  My two year old twin boys loved playing at the table but sadly the durability of this product was very poor.  The legs were very unstable upon receipt of the item.  We were extremely dissapointed which is unusual being that it was a Step 2 product.

Unless your baby has very long legs, they are not going to be able to push the buttons to spray the water. My son is 1 and cannot reach them with his feet in either his convertible seat or the infant seat. However, he is fascinated with it and leans forward to grab at it when I am trying to buckle him into his seat.

Also, I have had mine about 4 months and the water is evaporated out of it, and I am not finding a way to put new water into it. The floaty things inside get stuck between the plastic after the water has evaporated - and it's kind of ridiculous to have to bring it in every day to keep it out of the heat

Who ever designed this gate has no clue what to expect from a 1 year old child.  This gate is all look and no function.  It looks great when you install it but had no strenght to resist a 13 month old child from pushing it in the middle and almost breaking it.  If you plan on buying this gate be prepared to do a little bit of drilling and bolting to make it work.  I was finally able to use the thing only after I bought four #8-32 x 1 3/4" long screws with matching washers and nuts and bolted the middle of the gate together.  I did this by unscrewing the original connection at the middle of the gate and overlapped the pieces together about 6" then drilling two holes about 4" apart on the top and bottom rails and bolting together. It works! But it's not what someone should have to do after spending thie price for something.  Good luck!!

I recently purchased this gate for an opening in my home that is 68 inches wide.  Within one week of use, the wood splintered apart in the center rendering it completely unusable.  I am returning the gate and puchasing the more expensive metal type.  This gate is a perfect example of getting what you pay for

I recently purchased this gate, as I needed a gate for a space that is 93 inches wide. I was so happy when I found this, and for the price! Well, I installed it with no problem at all. But it is not secure. It actually bends forward and backward with barely any pressure and when my daughter leaned against it, the wooden dowels that hold the bars together actually started to break. AWFUL and very unsafe!!!  Target.com was very helpful in sending UPS to pick it up.

I can't believe anyone would give this stroller a good review. We have 10m twins, and have been using the stroller for about 4-5 months. It's terrible.

PROBLEMS: 

1. NO SUN PROTECTION. the visors are locked in place. Unless the sun is directly overhead or at your back, it will be beating in your babies' eyes, and you'll need to buy a non-Peg Perego sunshade accessory.
2. HARD TO STEER. It gets stuck going across the lawn and on compacted dirt. If the sidewalk buckles just an inch (common from tree roots), the stroller is stopped dead in its tracks. It's hard to steer in a straight line, so it's easy to get stuck when going through narrow doorways or down narrow sidewalks. 
3. IT'S FLIMSY. The bottom of the storage area underneath stretched and sagged after a month of use. It now drags on the ground and rubs against the wheels even when nothing is in it. The cupholder broke during the first week.
4. HARD TO UNFOLD. It takes two hands to unfold and you have to give it a vigorous shake to get it to completely unfold and snap into position. Don't even THINK about about trying to set it up with a baby in your hands: you need both hands free to deal with this thing.
5. BAD CUSTOMER SUPPORT. The stroller comes with no weight/height/age  suggestions. When we first tried to put our twins in it, they were swimming in it, and couldn't be upright. When we called Peg Perego and asked how big the kids should be to use it safely, the support rep said " don't know." 

Yes it's lightweight and folds up nicely. But the light weight is actually a drawback; it means the handle and legs are flimsy and wobbly -- resulting in a stroller that's difficult to steer. 

My advice would be to seriously consider jogging strollers. Even if you aren't an active parent -- I'm not -- get something sturdy with big wheels to get you over the dips and bumps and cracks and patches of sand, dirt, and grass that you will encounter.  If stroller size is the most important factor to you, look at "stadium seating" strollers.

I purchased this when I was due to have my second baby.  I thought Peg Perego products were supposed to be so great - and they are always so much more expensive.  I don't mind spending the $$$ if you get better, but this is just a horrible stroller.  It doesn't turn easily at all, the wheels constantly get stuck.  There is one cup holder that is soooo small and doesn't stay upright.  There is no room for any storage: bags, pocket book, keys, phone, snack.  They trays for the kids in front are so small and narrow.  the seats are too tight and small- they are not comfortable for the children whether they are awake or asleep.  There is nothing I like about this at all, it makes going out where ever not easy at all.  For the amounnt of money theu have the nerve to charge for this, they should be ashamed.  I actually use my orignal "cheap" single stroller, instead.

This stroller is made of very cheap material. Merely after a few months of light use, the stroller is already hard to push, and wheels are easily stuck whenever I try to make a turn. Even for a less than half-an-inch road bump, I have to physically get in front of the stroller and lift the front wheels in order to get pass. The shopping basket touches the ground whenever the road is a little uneven, and the outside fabrics is already worn out. 
Not to mention, the sun shades are no use at all because they are too small. Without buying an extention shade, they are practically just some decoration to make this product more look like a stroller. It is definitely not worth the price. BTW, their customer service is terrible as well.

I bought this about a year ago based on great reviews.  I'm not surprised to see bad reviews a year later.    
Problems:
The uneven weight difference causes the Aria to pull  
The small wheels grab into anything softer than concrete (forget the grass at the park) 
The trays are too small for sippy cups and more than a couple of cheerios
The fabric storage area underneath is held up with six "buttonholes" that tore after a few uses with a not very heavy diaper bag
The straps are really tricky to figure out and I've never been able to get them right
The shades are very small and next to worthless
The drink holder is negligible and sometimes interferes with opening and closing the stroller

For the money I spent I wish I'd been less afraid of getting something a little heavier and go with a jogger style with a swivel front wheel.  It's amazing how weight of a stroller is an issue with your first child, but how Herculean you become once you have two.  Also, the whole one-handed open-close feature that I craved on my single stroller is a non-issue when you have two kids because it's safest to have them strapped into carseats before dealing with the stroller anyway.  If I could, I'd sell this one and get a jogger (I need something that moves on the mulch and grass at the playground) but I don't think I could sell this one for more than $20 in clear conscience.  A shame

I have two double strollers, 1 front and back Graco and this side by side Aria.  I don't use the front/back Graco much do to not being able to have both children sleeping at the same time (2 1/2 year and 1 year.  I had the Peg MT single first and loved it.  So thought the product quality would be the same.  Used it for 2 years with no problems.  But have to say stay clear of the aria design.  Our side by side had numerous pieces fall off, cup holder, seat clip, logo tag, clip to hold trays in place, etc.  Its not durable at all!  We even have to close it using a pen on one side due to the clip you lift on the left side falling off too!  We took it on a plane trip last week and have sworn the whole stroller off.   My sister in law had the single and was having the same problems with the product.  She has since bought the Maclaren single and I am in the process of purchasing the Maclaren Twin Techno.  It may cost more but it would have been alot cheeper buying it first than second

For one thing, it is very hard to steer and get over bumps.  The wheels are always getting stuck.  Second, it is hard to close.  The most frustrating part is the steering issue.  Also, my Aria decal fell off as well many months ago.  I've only had the stroller for nine months.  One more thing, the canopy to block out the sun is basically worthless since it offers very little protection from the sun.

If you are walking straight without turning then this stroller is good for you.  But just try turning and especially sharp turns--you'll be stalling and getting stuck the entire way.

My hsuband and and decided that I would nurse Hailey her entire first year.  I work at a school and was able to pump twice a day.  I didn't like doing it in school though because there wasn't space for it.  SO I would go in my car and do it.  All I had a first was the battery pack.  I would go through 10 batteries a week and half way through the week I would loose strength/suction.

Once I got the adapter I never had a problem again.  We could go anywhere and I would always have access to power Including when we drove from VA to GA.  My husband would drive and I would pump.  It is great..

This diaper pail is affordable and uses regular garbage bags, both of which were important to us when buying a diaper pail BEFORE the reality of dirty diapers. Even when we emptied the pail often and sprayed it with Lysol between uses, it still smelled bad every time we opened it. Sometimes the smell seeped out, so it made the whole bedroom stink.
And my kids have no problem pressing the blue lid-popping latch-and, of course, adding their toys or other opjects to the contents of the dirty diaper pail.
The twisting mechanism to remove the full bag is a great idea. It helps you not get the face full of odor when you open the pail... BUT you cannot let the pail get even close to full, or it wont twist. And after two years of use, the twisting mechanism doesn't work anymore. The latch for the small opening is also broken

I bought this diaper pail because it used regular garbage bags and it was less expensive.  Well, I learned my lessen- you get what you pay for.  Like some other reviews the spring on my top broke which is supposed to keep the claw, if you will, closed after you put the diaper in and keep the smell in.  I changed the bag often but the pail still absorbed the awful smell and after cleaning it and soaking it, it still stunk!  I am now on my second child and decided to buy the diaper genie.  I hope this will work out much better

I didn't give this pail 1 star because it does keep the stink out, and it does take standard garbage bags.  

After a few months of use, the spring assembly on the blue cover popped off.  I assembled it back together, and within a few days, the spring broke in half.  I tried to get another spring by calling Safety First.  They only had the blue top without the spring.  The guy said I'd just have to buy another pail if I wanted a working pop top

This diaper pail is certainly the worst I have used.  It works ok for about a week and by the end of that first week I was ready to get a new diaper pail.  It does not keep oders in much at all, and I don't even put poopy diapers in it.  After about a week the springs started constantly falling off of the thing inside that supposedly keeps the bag closed and the oder out so it doesn't do any good.  Yes, a plus is the using regular bags, but so does the Diaper Champ and it also keeps oders in much better than this.  I'm definitely going back to the Diaper Champ; I only bought this one because it was the only one at my store, now I know it was worth the wait for the Diaper Champ in the mail

My husband and I bought this with the hopes that it would keep the odor inside and we could save the money on refills.  Well, it did not control odor.  The plastic disk that is included to neutralize the odor works for about a week.  The odor escaped even when the pail was closed.  You do save money on refills at first.  But when the diapers become stinkier as the baby grows, you have to change the bag more often.  I used A LOT of baking soda and Lysol spray to help control the stink.  

Also, the button on the top that opens the pail can fail easily, and it is also very easy for a child to get into once they start pulling up on things.

I would not recommend this product

Pro: Inexpensive and can use regular household 13 gallon garbage bags. Can add any odor disk in an available cup provided.

Con: Does not mask odors. I have 8 month old triplets and it doesn't help at all. Even with one baby, to change the bag daily is a waste of a big bag unless one baby goes through tons of diapers a day. With my triplets they still don't fill the bin in a day, about every other day. I have the original Diaper Genie with my 10 year old but thought against using it since we'd have to buy the refill bags so much more often with triplets. The old Genie doesn't hold as much but it sure holds the smell better. If I had it to do over again, I would not buy this pail, which I bought two, one for upstairs and one for down. If the smell isn't a problem for you, go for it. But if you're picky with the smell, research something else

I was very excited to finally recieve this stroller, but after I put it together (which was pretty simple), it was very heavy and bulky to handle. I was looking for a stroller to accomodate my big 2 1/2 year-old and a new baby due soon.  I bought this stroller sight unseen because it seemed like the perfect solution. 
I was not able to load it in the back of mt SUV due to the size and weight, and it is very long and hard to steer. Anyone considering the Ionic color pattern may again want to check it out in person because the silver fabric is very shiney.
It does not accomodate my Evenflo carrier either, so I would have needed to also purchase the Graco carseat.
I am returning the stroller to Amazon today

I wish I would have checked the reviews other people wrote before buying this item!  These are flimsy, thin little sheets that are not snug or even slightly fitted for that matter.  I'm definitely going to have to purchase another brand that will actually fit the play yard pad.  Fortunately there are other products that work better...if this was the only option, I might as well not have a sheet on at all.

I bought the set thinking that it was similar to the newer edition of the Nurser, which I already had but needed more bottles for convenience.  I was very disappointed.  The lids leaked and the nipple rings leaked and the bottle plastic seemed cheap.  I used it for about a week and then got rid of it

It's flimsy...breaks at the slightest touch...it's a PAIN to open and close!  My 15 month old figured out that all you have to do is shake the gate a little and it opens...I found this out when I was putting groceries away...I went to look for her and she was on the 2nd stair from the top!  I can't say enough bad things about this gate.  It's worthless.  If I could rate it MINUS stars I would

The problems I had with this gate:

1. The instructions for using the template to install the hinges, for the fixed gate, was not easy to understand. I finally gave up and I improvised. Doing so, the installation went more smoothly.
2. The gate is not sturdy. If anyone were to bump into it, I'm pretty sure it would break.
3. The mechanism to click/unclick the lock is more difficult than it should be. Fortunately, the people who will using it, have a strong enough grip to get it to work.

Despite these flaws, however, this gate does serve its purpose, in my case. I bought this gate to keep my dogs confined to a room --- which it does. They don't go near the gate, so fortunately, I don't have to worry about them leaning on, or jumping on, it. As for the locking mechanism, it's annoying, and I'm just hoping it doesn't get any worse.

This gate would not be safe for kids

If I could give it negitive stars I would! We bought two of these gates due to a couple of very wide openings that needed to be secured. These gates are horrible and very poorly designed. Every time someone tries to open the gate, it sags and pulls the wood dowels out of the frame and it completely falls apart! We have older children that have had to resort to crawling over it to get into the living room just to avoid its eminent collapse. And often it collapses anyway. Now my 11 month old son has figured out that if he shakes the gate at the joint he can pull it completely apart and crawl right through. Now we have to purchase new gates that actually work to replace these.

This gate is absolutely worthless.  If I could give it zero stars, I would.  It was difficult to install and is very flimsy. I have it at the top of the stairs and I don't trust that it will hold at all. I hate that I spent so much on the gate and now I have to purchase another one.

This is the flimsiest gate ever.  To boot it is not cheap.  I couldn't even use the screws that came with the gate.  I had to use nails and duck tape.  The instructions were wrong about sizing it up to fit your area and it took me over 1 hour to put it together.  Unfortunately when I bought this gate, there were only 2 reviews posted - one was good and one was not so good.  So I was a little confused but I needed a swing gate.  So needless to say - I wanted to make sure that I put my comments on so that no one else will get swindled.  This gate isn't even worth $1.0

I bought this car seat because it looked actractive and safe.  Well, after one month I returned it because it is the worst car seat ever.  The car seat sits so upright that my sons head was always falling completely forward.  He never looked comfortable.  The car seat comes with the strap covers that are suppose to make the car seat comfortable.  These things only make it worse because they are extremely rough and bulky.  

This car seat is extremely heavy even without the infant in it.  The carrying handle is a joke because you have to push the canopy back to put your arm under it.  The canopy is also terrible because it barely works.  It only works when the sun is directly above you in the sky.  I was constantly having to change the direction I was carrying the car seat to avoid the sun beaming on his face.  (unlike the Graco where you can pull the shade all the way down)  I hated returning this because I really liked the looks of it but I had to for my sons sake.  I bought the graco seat in the blackwell print (which is an o.k. looking fabric).  

We are both soooo much happier.  He looks comfortable and a little more reclined.  The sun isn't in his face and I have $130 extra dollars that I can spend on something else.  I think people mainly buy peg perego because they like the way it looks (as I did) or because they expect it to be high quality because of the high price (as I did).  But in actuality it just sucks.  I wish that Graco would make their prouducts a little more stylish because they are definitly more practical and functional.

These retail now for $229 at BRU. Just ridiculous. I own one, bought it on eBay for $28 since it was a local pickup only sale. I got a heckuva deal, I'll admit!

This is a fantastic carseat.....but folks, it's JUST an infant carseat! I went looking on eBay for one, since, having had babies before, I couldn't fathom shelling out even $100 for a cheapo, often-recalled Graco, let alone $229 for a Peg Perego!  All new babies sweat in car seats....they can't maintain their own body temp until 4 months of age, which is when they grow out of these seats (unless your back goes first) :).

I understand the precautions about car seats being in car accidents.....another folly of the infant gear industry. If car seats are in accidents, they're junk folks.....they aren't in re-saleable condition. And when was the last time that you heard of a car accident involving a baby? Because how many new parents of newborns who would buy a $229 carseat (read: first child) go out further than a trip to the store?

It's a regular old car seat. They can't do much to these, really, except change the fabric. They pretty much prey on your fear surrounding your new pride and joy, so they gauge you on your emotions....hey, I'm a sucker too!

Infant seats are notoriously small, so that you have to buy up the next size faster. They get your money on the car seat and then the stroller, before you are out of that hazy new parent fog and wise up. Save your money.....your baby or your back muscles will grow out of this in 4 months, no matter what.....and then it's $229 right down the drain, faster than a speeding bullet.....Guess you can save it for baby #2.

Think of it this way...for the SAME amount of money, buy a Britax Roundabout and have it last for 4 years versus 4 months, or go on eBay and buy one of these, 4 months old and pretty much brand new, for less than half the new price

The design is pretty narrow. My 3-4 months baby was far more under the pounds as the product described. The product tightened her so much that when she was in it she would cry. Unless you have a very small and quiet baby, otherwise it is not a wise choice

I bought this thermometer and liked it but after I used it a few times the buttons stopped working and I couldn't turn it off. I opened it to remove the battery and found that it had water in it. A bath thermometer should at least be waterproof

I love the idea of this product. Like many of the other reviewer's I don't have the regular traditional style crib. Our crib converts to a toddler bed. This product is based on traditional cribs and only works on those styles of cribs. I would love to use this product to protect my little on when they come out with one's that are more with the current styles of cribs, like mine's.

This is a great idea, however if your crib has anything larger than a Jenny Lind style piece of wood on it, it won't work.  We don't have a sleigh style crib, but the top edges were still too large for the velcro to even touch.  It would be great if they would come up with a larger size to work for the more popular/larger style cribs everyone seems to be making/buying these days

I bought this item because our son kept on getting his legs and arms stuck.  This item was made for a portable/small crib, not your typical crib.  I had to go out and spend another $40. on velcro so I can make it long/wide enough to fit my son's crib.  It is not worth the aggravation in altering it to fit the crib.  Don't waste your money on something that is not going to work.

These extensions should have been included with the co-sleeper.  As it is, the co-sleeper is lower than the average adult bed and the extensions are required if you want your child sleeping on your level.  The fact that they sell it as a separate item is pure gouging for an extra few bucks, which is irritating.  They are simple pieces of plastic and shouldn't add but a dollar or two to Arms Reach's cost.

There are twelve pieces, so you can use a max of 3 pieces per leg to increase it to the maximum height.  We had to do just that, and found that the three connected pieces are *very* unstable.

It's too bad they charge so much for a poorly constructed set of unstable plastic pieces.  What they should do is provide a set of pieces of varying heights, to prevent too many connections to a bed that's holding your precious child

This product was terrible.  First and foremost this seat did NOT fit on American Airlines Business Class seats!  Secondly, the rear facing car seat tilts so far forward that your baby is falling forward agains the harness and if they fall asleep their face is pressing against the seat belt.  The wheel covers fell off the first time I used it.  The stroller is a piece of junk.  When I called the company to explain my problems they never even called me back, so on top of it all they have a horrible product and terribel customer service to match.  Do not buy

I thought that this bathtub would be the best thing, because of the shower and spa feature. But the shower is so hard to use, it's so hard to push the button and hold the shower head at the same time. You also have to worry about your baby falling off or sliding down off the sling, beacause it's just not positiioned right, it sits too high up, and she just looks uncomfortable on it. You also have to worry about your baby hurting their toes on the shower and spa unit. It wasn't worth $40, the sling, and the spa and shower unit isn't useful or helpfula t all

When I saw this tub, I thought WoW this is great.  It had everything.  

Well after receiving the tub as a gift for my shower I decided to try it before the baby came.  I am so glad that I did.  The pump for the spa and shower was super loud and had a leak. The shower was very difficult to operate, I had to press really hard.  

The only thing that I loved about the tub was the sling.  It is very nice. I think when it comes to buying a tub for a baby simple is better... in the beginning speed is key, the baby gets to cold to really enjoy the features of this tub.  In my opinion get a simple tub and splurge on something else.

We don't have our baby yet  -but have tried the tub to see if it works.  The first one we bought did not work at all so we exchanged it.  this second one the spa works but the shower doesn't.  The company is sending me a new motor saying that is must be the motor.  Will try it again with the new motor of if the third one doesn't work we will return it and get a different tub - and probably something else for that money

In theory this sounds awesome, but in reality is comes really close to being useless. 

1) The "spa" is nothing more than a light flow of water which isn't even enough to create bubbles, it comes out of the corner of the pump unit so hardly any of the stream will reach your baby

2) The shower head has a button that is nearly impossible to keep pressed in for longer than 10 seconds, the flow of water is very weak so is not powerful enough to rinse out hair. A cup does a better job than this.

3) The tub itself is pretty decent, the plateau used to lay your baby on seems nice and comfy and the temperature indicator is a nice bonus.

All in all I wish we had saved our money and just gone with a normal tub, I advise anyone else to do the same

I liked this tub at first.  The size was nice, and the sling was comfortable and good support for my preemie newborn.  After about a month of use, though, there was a horrible odor emitting from the mesh sling.  This was after "squeezing" it out as best I could and propping it up to dry after every use.  The sling is not machine washable and therefore unusable after it gets ruined by mold. 
I stopped using the sprayer after the first couple days.  It was just too much of a pain to fill it up everytime, especially since it doesn't even spray well.  The other reviewers are correct in saying that the button on the sprayer is difficult to press.  Especially when your hands are wet and slippery.
It's a good thing BRU will take back anything!  I am off to return it and purchase the old faithful cheapie tub

I registered for this tub wanting it very bad for my newborn.  I thought what a great idea for fussy babies to have a spa and not to mention the shower rinse.  Well, the first time I used this it took more time to set it up than I did using it.  Also, the button on the shower head IS hard to press, and the sprayer needs to remain upside down or it will leak water allover your bathroom(found that out the hard way). When you use the spa bubbles it makes the water cold very quick.  My daughter does love the spa effect, but I think she prefers warm water throughout her bath.  The one thing that has really annoyed me is the baby sling has a moldy smell to it.  I have washed and dried it many times and cannot get this smell out.  Needless to say I had to purchase another insert for the tub, which doesn't fit very well, so Im a bit irritated.  Overall this is a good idea, it needs some kinks worked out of it....Just not worth $40.  So now Im off to target to purchase a new tub :-

This is my first amazon review b/c I feel this is such junk I had to review it and epinions didnt have it listed.  Usually I can find something to do with a junky product, but this is so junky I can't do anything with it, I might as well have just washed the money down the drain.  The fabric is rough, too rough for a new baby, the hole is too big for a tiny baby to lay atop it well but a bigger baby laying on it even on the bottom of the tub as intended is unstable.  As a seat it immediately fills up with water if you even touch it, once filled it sinks.  How can it support a baby if baby can't touch it or it sinks.  You have to ring it out in order to use the plastic hanger it comes with b/c it absorbs so much water it is way to heavy for the convenient hanger, the hanger ends up bending so much the thing slips off or it looks like it is going to break.  Not easy to do with baby in hand so you have to leave it sitting in the tub while you get baby out and get a chance to go back later.  I have 4 kids and have tried a lot of tubs, seats and supports for the tub, some I disliked but none even come close to the uselessness of thi

I've never written a negative review... if I could give this zero stars I would.  First of all, it sinks the instant you put it in the tub... like all the way to the bottom of the tub.  The tag says to ring it out if it sinks... hmmm... how do you do that when your kid is in it?  Second of all, it weighs about 100 lbs when you take it out of the tub.  I swear... this is the worst baby product I've ever owned (and I've owned a LOT)... My 6mo son sits up great on his own, was slipping and sliding around in this, falling backwards, I had to hold him the entire time with both hands... pathetic.  Don't waste your money.  Tomorrow we will be going out to get the traditional plastic bath seat... good grief

I would recommend a seat that clamps to the side of the tub over this if your baby moves at all!  This seemed like a good idea, but my little guy was kicking and moving all over.  It barely floats and sucks up water so it is extremely heavy to lift up and hang to dry when you are done with the bath.  It also says that it is for 0 months on up, but I definitely wouldn't use this if your baby can't sit

Seems like a good idea for a seat.  I liked the handles for them to hold on to (more sanitary) and it sits okay on a big adult seat.  But the opening is just too small.  It is not the lack of a deflector.  I have another brand with a bigger opening for our other bathroom and my son does fine on that one.  This one the pee gets all over his legs, the seat, the stool and the floor each and every time.  This is a big hassle, unsanitary and a pain to clean up each time he tries to go potty.  Maybe it would be okay for a petite girl but not for a boy.  We are shopping for a replacement now.  I don't want a deflector type because the doctors warn that they can scrape a little boys private area and cause them to not want to sit on the potty because it might hurt.  We just teach him to point "it" down and on a potty with a bigger opening that works just fine

my 2 1/2 year was interested in this seat right away, much more so than his small potty. However, he cries every time because the small bump in the front is not sufficient enough of a splash guard. He gets wet, the floor and his step stool are all wet. Clean up is a nightmare. It's in the trash now.

I bought this seat for my son when he was probably around 6 months old and just starting on solid foods.  Ten months later, I hardly ever use the darn thing.  It worked okay for us for a little while but it was not one of my better baby purchases.  My complaints with the product:

- Not particularly sturdy.  The backrest portion in particular seems to pop off way too easily.
- The straps that secure it to the kitchen chair are annoyingly long and in the way.  Not such a problem when the seat is secured to the chair because you can just tuck the straps in somewhere.  However, everytime I remove the seat from the chair the straps prove to be a real pain in the rear.  And unfortunately it seems I need to unstrap and remove the seat after every meal to clean the bits of food that inevitably end up on the big chair to which this seat is secured (another complaint).
- The second tray which pops on over the swing away tray (at least on my particular model) is very easily removed by my son.  He lifts it up and dumps his food on the floor.  The point of this second tray was to make food prep and cleanup easier but it fails miserably.
- This seat is not at all sturdy or useful as a stand alone seat.  It HAS to be strapped to a chair or it will easily tip over. 

The good things about this product are that it is relatively inexpensive and is a good spacesaving alternative to a regular highchair which sucks up so much floor space.  It is also fairly easy to clean due to the plastic design.  

Overall it is not a bad product but not on my list of favorites.  If I had it to do over, I would have bought a similar type of chair but probably a different brand

We had been researching booster seats for our 2 year old and we found this seat and thought it was an large enough and sturdy enough for our rambunctious son.  Boy, were we wrong.  The first time we put our son in it the seat fell apart.  So we popped it back into place and all he has to do is wiggle a bit and the seat pops out again.  He only weighs 30 pounds and it specs for up to 50....I would definitely not recommend this to anyone.

It lasted a year and it goes in the dishwasher and that is all the good there is to say about it.  Now the bad!  The pivot point where the back attaches to the chair is poorly engineered and comes off way to easy.  Mine is warn to the point that my 20 month old can pull it off when he is sitting in it.  First he takes the tray off (also very easy for him) and then he pulls the back off.  At that point he shimmies out of the straps and is out of the whole thing.  Don't plan on it lasting through more than one child

I purchased two of these seats for my twins over a year ago when they were about 18 mos or so.  I have had consistent problems with both seats frequently popping out of the base units.  The sides and back height positions are set at the same levels so that is not the problem.  Weight of the children is not an issue as the weight limit is 50 lbs per the specs and my boys are not even close to that.

I would not recommend these seats based upon my experience with them

We bought this booster when my son was 18 months old as he loved to sit like his parents.  However, he is a very large boy (35" and 34 lbs) and the tray could not fit over his legs comfortably.  So we took off the tray so he could sit at the table, and he uses the holes where the tray attaches to stick food.  We went back to the high chair without the tray - and he is perfectly happy.  We use this seat when visiting relatives which is nice it is so portable, but then spend time afterwards cleaning up the food underneath the seat where he stuck the food

We bought the bumbo seat for our five month old baby. By her fifth month she fell on her face with it still attached to her bottom. She was hurt pretty bad. No way this seat can keep the baby in place with its own weight. 
Please beware of how unsafe this product is. Not at all what is advertised.

My son received a Bumbo seat for Christmas.  At five months of age, he rolled out of it and was laying on top of the seat.  At six months of age, he turned in the seat and fell on to his HEAD on two different occassions.  The seat was on a flat surface.  He did this and I was standing or sitting right next to him.
I loved this seat when he first got it.  I told everyone I knew about it. He has two older siblings and he  loved to be able to watch them play.  His siblings loved him sitting in the seat because he was at their level.  
 Now, I have absolutely NO confidence in the safety of this seat.  It is completely useless as his "own body weight" DOES NOT "keep baby in place" as advertised.  The seat has been rendered useless in my home because it is NOT safe and it is safer to put him in a traditional bouncy seat or on the floor.

I received this seat for a gift and was told how wonderful it is. I have a large baby. He was almost 17 lbs at four months old. So his thighs and bottom barely fit in it after three to four months of age. He also was able to get out of it bu straightening his back and legs. He didn't seem very happy in it. It may work better if you have a smaller baby, but the chubbier ones will    never fit for long

I am SO perplexed at the popularity of this item!  When it first came out, I purchased one for my son (he was around six months old at the time).  He immediately figured out how to get out of the seat by leaning back, extending his arms behind him, and straightening his legs, so I returned it.  By the time I had my second child (a girl), Bumbomania had kicked in, and these seats were EVERYWHERE.  I began to think that my son's experience was a fluke, and I purchased another one for my daughter.  Low and behold, she immediately figured out how to get out of the seat in the EXACT SAME WAY!  So I returned the second Bumbo as well, but not before noticing that the instructions did contain a warning that some children "may" be able to get out of the seat.  In conclusion, although the Bumbo may work great for some - BEWARE!  If you have little Houdinis like I do, this product is simply not safe

the monitor is ok, but sometimes is staticky and other times just needs a new "channel" and the problem with that is that the button that changes the channel is in the baby's room not on the parent unit!!! Also, we like to have a second child unit elsewhere in our house and if both are on at the same time it seems to cause additional static, broken signal (only to be reset by changing the channel) and no signal. Overall, i am very disappointed - it got tremendous reviews and i expected a better product than the first years model i had previouly...and i am goig back to my old one

i bought this item as so many people has said how much they loved it.  i find it a nightmare!  if you stand in the corridor between the monitor and the receiver it cuts out.  it does not work when on the charger.  it does not work unless there is a clear line between the two parts. what a piece of junk.  I would in no way recommend this product to anyone

I will state that this monitor is very clear and has no interference BUT ours died after five months of just nighttime use and neither charger works...we tried plugging the monitors directly into the wall, charging for days at a time, and even searched endlessly for replacement batteries with no luck. I had ignored a review I read similar to the one I'm writing just before I purchased this imonitor, I learned my lesson!  Purchase with caution.

I bought this pump because it was recommended by a lactation consultant.  I thought it would be the only pump I would need, but it didn't work!    I found this out at the worst possible time - the third day after giving birth when my milk came in.  I was completely engorged and my daughter was not able to latch on.  I tried this pump and it would not maintain suction!  I didn't have another pump handy and had to express milk by hand (very painful at the time) just so my daughter could latch on.  I have retried it several times using all the tips in the instruction manual and it never expressed any milk for me!  I was very disappointed with this pump and not able to return it.  A waste of money at a time when there was not much to spare

I bought this for my daughter and I too had one light that worked, my husband had to take light apart and play with the wires and somehow got the lights to work. I am not crazy about the bar where the blocks go because it keeps falling off along with the hood on the front of the bus. My daughter barely plays with it and the music only plays when we turn the bus on. Needless to say I am very disappointed with this toy

My baby got this for Christmas.  He was about 7 months old.  Now, a couple months later, he still doesn't play with it.  My 3-year old doesn't play with it either and he loves most of our other "baby" toys.  This toy is just not that interesting.  I wish my mother-in-law would have saved her money or bought shoes or anything useful at all

My daughter really LOVES this BUS.  Whenever it is in the room she rolls over to it and loves to sit up next to it.  She plays with the blocks and likes to discover how to hold them and also look at what is inside them.   
The BAD thing with this is that it rolls when she is holding onto it and the little piece with the shapes flaps up.  My daughter was playing with it one day and the piece flaped up and she ended up with her arm stuck in between it and the toy and she was leaning on the flap putting pressure on it against her arm.  But since that snaps off we took it off and there has not been an issue since.

I gave my father-in-law a couple ideas for my son's (1 year old) Christmas gift and this was one of the items. Boy do I regret giving him this as an idea. It is a cheaply constructed toy. The bus's hood doesn't even work correctly. The toy does not do much of interest and it constantly makes this annoying noise! The toy held my son's attention for less than 5 minutes. My suggestion to anyone considering this toy is there are many more worthwhile toys on the market- skip this one

I bought this toy for my 6-month old son to grow into over the next year because it seemed to offer a variety of ways to learn and play. When putting it together Christmas morning the pieces did not snap together securely and kept falling off. Also, one light does not work. The poor construction of this toy is disappointing coming from Fischer-Price. I will be returning (not exchanging) this toy. Luckily my son is young enough that he will not miss it

This was nothing but a cheap piece of masonite board that you can have cut for about $5.00 at any hardware store. It cost me a total of $23.00 after shipping for this product. It doesn't even look like the picture. It isn't black with Angelcare written on it. It is literally a normal, brown piece of board. It's blatant false advertizing. I feel sick, not to mention a total idiot for thinking I would actually need this particular board to go with my monitor. If you have the Angelcare Movement Sensor monitor and don't have a flat bottomed crib then all you need is any old piece of wood or thick cardboard. Do not buy this. It is a disgrace

This is such a ridiculous excuse for a toilet seat lid.  It's easy enough to install but hello!  What's to stop anybody, especially a toddler from lifting the entire seat and lid together?  Not a thing!  The "kit" that comes with it to secure it to the toilet rim is a joke in that it rattles around like crazy and when it's closed, it doesn't fit snuggly around the seat so it's completely loose.  Total and complete piece of junk!!

We bought this travel system because it is light to be lifted and comfortable but, the chest clips are so uncomfortable to close, and hard to open, specially the one that goes between the legs, it is so hard to buckle and unbuckle  that I'm afraid I'm going to hurt my baby every time we have to close or open them, and is complicated to align them to finally buckle. In fact I had an emergency with my baby and took a lot of time to open these clips

At first loved it because the travel system, with stroller, is so light and doesn't look doudy like other systems. 
But: the harness buckle is so difficult to fasten that the baby gets irritated before we even get to the car. The straps never tangled, but it is extremely difficult to adjust as needed. The carrying handle has to moved up/down with two hands, a button on each, that must be simultaneously pushed to lower the handle. Difficult to perform when you're already reaching into the center of the car to even get to the baby.
Yes it is a trendy color with the gray, but it is not cotton and is not padded well and does not breathe! It is horribly hot for the baby. Still love the stroller by combi, but I never recommend the car seat to ANYONE. Luckily, time to move 5 month old to a larger seat anyway.

We started out really liking this seat.  Its colors are not horrid like most of the others, and it doesn't cry "I have a baby!!".  It just looks nice and stylish.  Also, our baby seemed very comfortable in this seat.  HOWEVER, the #1 problem of this seat is its straps/belts.  

First, you clip them together at the baby's midsection (easy).  Then you need to try to get these 2 pieces to fit together at the bottom, so you can clip them (as one) into the female end of the lap belt clip.  This is easier said than done, as these 2 pieces are very difficult to hold together as you clip them (as one) into the other part of the belt clip.  It's hard to explain properly, but really, it's not easy to do, especially if you have only one hand free.

Second, the belts get twisted.  The 2 pieces at the base of the belt, which need to be held together so they can clip into the female end of the belt clip, they get reversed because the belt twists.  Think of taking your seat belt in your car, and somehow twisting the belt itself, so the seat belt clip now faces the wrong way.  If this has ever happened to you, you know what I mean, and it's a pain to fix.  Just like with this seat.  It seems to get screwed up effortlessly, but then to fix it takes several minutes.  

FORGET THIS THING!!  We bit the bullet and exchanged it for a Peg Perego, after we used a friend's when we went to visit them for a long weekend, and realized that not all the infant seats sucked like ours did.  The final problem we noticed is that this seat was that our 14-pound son was basically already too big for it...  Yet the Peg Perego had plenty of growing room.  Yes, it cost us about $100 more, but it's well worth it for the ease of use and the fact that our son will fit in it until it's time for the standard (non-infant) car seat

I was disappointed that the cup holders come off too easy, they button onto the car seat and it isn't strong enough so when my boys try to stuff their juice or water in them they snap right back off. The are no longer attached to the seats because I refuse to keep putting them back on.

I guess this seat is okay, it is nice and plush but the downside to getting a backless seat (which I didn't think about before I purchased this) was the fact that the kids can't fall asleep in these seats. My kids like I am sure most kids are when they go for a drive the motion knocks them right out.  But because there is nothing to support their head and neck they slump over and are very uncomfortable so they usually don't fall asleep unless they are just really beat and then I worry because I don't want them to get a crook in their neck.  

I can say that this seat is very lightweight which is a big change coming from the regular child seat.

I ordered this product for my 3 year old who just moved into a toddler seat and had head slumping problems! The two major problems with this product is that 1.) it's quite bulky, and so her head would tend to fall forward anyway, and 2.) check if it will fit in your carseat. I have the apex toddler seat that is quite wide, and you can't leave the pillows in place, they stand up at a 45 degree angle. I attached elastic to the bottom in order to fix them to the plastic that holds the seat pad in place. This works, but obviously only if you're sitting next to them when they fall asleep! Other than that you'd have to stop the car, get out and attach them, then go again, by which time the child is probably awake anyway! To be honest, I haven't seen a better alternative yet though. It's quite good to pull around and use as a pillow for your own head on long trips though

When my son was in a convertible car seat which was tilted back slightly and had head/side wings, this pillow worked well.  It was propped well enough to support my son's head when he took a nap.  But when we had to switch him to a straight-back booster seat that had shallow head wings, this pillow was not usable at all

I bought this because the only way my 6 week old will sleep is in bed with me. I bought this to try to reduce the risk of SIDS since his has been sleeping in my bed. Unfortunately, he kept moving and it was causing his legs to go off of the side of the sleeper. Once his legs went off the side, his upper body would roll which would cause his face to be almost right against the side of the sleeper. Of course this concerned me so each time I woke up, I had to move him again. Finally, after a couple of time of doing this, I just took him out of it. This is the second sleep positioner I have bought and both have been worthless!!!

I was so excited about this product because it was sold out everywhere I looked, so I figured it must be awesome. Not so. It is loud, which freaked out my 8 month old, and did not suck the stuff out of his nose very well. I've tried every aspirator on the market, and nothing works better than the one they use at the hospital. I took that one home with me, and urge you to do the same :)

Very disappointed

This product pulls nothing out of the noses of my one year old twins.  We had hoped that it would be easier than manual aspirators but it has proven totally useless.  Unless your child's nose is leaking like a faucet save your money and get the rubber aspirators.

Perhaps if I hadn't already had a different type of bunting, I wouldn't be so disappointed with this one. My sister loaned me her Eddie Bauer bunting when my son was born. She will be having her next baby any week now, so I had to return it to her which meant I had to buy a new one. I saw nothing but great reviews on this product, so I picked one up.

First of all, I followed the washing instructions, washing it separately on delicate and drying it on low, and it ripped at the one seam!! Based on that alone, I will be returning it.

Aside from that, having used a bunting with a different design, I am not thrilled with this one. Part of the point of using a bunting is so that when you're in a car where you have heat, you can open up the bunting on a longer drive so baby doesn't overheat. This bunting zips down both sides to the bottom (by the way, zipping/unzipping is tricky with a baby kicking around; the zipper gets stuck in the material a lot), rather than down the middle front (that style zipper was NEVER a problem). Then you have this thick cover at baby's feet and nowhere to go with it, as the bottom of the carseat is up against the back seat of the car! So you either have to rig it so it is up the back of the seat and tucked under the headrest, or you have to leave it on baby's legs.

Also, the top of this bunting does fold over so that baby's face isn't covered unless you want it to be, BUT...my 5-month old has no problem picking it up and pulling it up over his own face. He did it this morning on the way to daycare. This bunting is too thick for me to feel comfortable with him doing that. And I can't be reaching in the back seat to pull it down off his face!

There is no disputing that the concept of a bunting is great, and that this particular bunting is toasty warm. It is wonderful being able to put the baby in his carseat and strap him in safely w/out a snowsuit being in the way, or having to bundle him up before going out and unbundle him every time you get to your destination. But I don't think the design of the Urban Bundle-Me is great and I actually think this bunting is TOO warm (even with the bunting open on a long car ride the other day, my son's back was all sweaty when we took him out of the carseat). After calling several stores and looking at all my options at Babies 'R' Us, I ended up ordering a new Eddie Bauer All-Season Bunting from Target.com (which cost less than $20 including shipping). I can't wait till it gets here. I will be returning the $60 Urban Bundle-Me as soon as I can

I ordered this through Walmart.Com and received it damaged, but Walmart and/or Storkcraft use a distributor called SEKO Worldwide.  The Seko delivery truck delivered the crib. So either this is a Storkcraft problem or a SEKO problem, but the head board had a piece completely split off in two and the other pieces were dented or chipped off. Walmart is re-odering another crib and having this one picked up for me as it is an 80-pound box.  Hopefully the next crib won't be damaged, but if so, I am giving up on Storkcraft completely. Walmart didn't have a rating system to leave comments, and when I saw others on this website that had damage problems, I wanted to relay my experience as well.  Walmart graciously refunded my shipping fee, which was large.  I then received the second crib and it was spotless.  The delivery man from Seko Worldwide said that they hear complaints on this a lot and blamed the air carrier that flies the boxes out to the ground shipping location. I also emailed Storkcraft about what happen and the other negative reviews, they offered to send a replacement piece for the broken piece (but no mention about the dented/chipped piece) and then proceeded to place the blame on the retailer.  I was not impressed. 

I was willing to take my chances on the reorder and was one of the fortunate customers who recieved an unmarked crib.  I put it together myself, all the parts were accounted for and the drawer works great.  I only bought this for the price and the convertable feature but will not buy Storkcraft in the future.

I bought this chair used and I don't think it's worth the $50 I paid for it. I also have the Fisher Price chair  (I have twins) and that one is SO much better - I wish I had 2 of those. First, like everyone has said, it is ridiculous to clean. Those people who said it's easy to clean must either not be really cleaning it or have babies that make very little mess. Gross food particles collect in every crease and corner, especially under the seat. 

Most importantly, the tray is way too high - even at 1 yrs old my girls are uncomfortable reaching food on it and they are an average height/weight. The tray also doesn't come close enough so there is a big gap between the baby and the chair - not dangerous but perfect for all the food to fall through and collect in the sides of the chair and on the lap.

Finally, the tray is too big for an average size dishwasher so must always be washed by hand. The FP high chair tray can go right into the dishwasher.

ONLY BUY THIS CHAIR IF THE ONLY THING YOU CARE ABOUT IS HOW IT LOOKS

Now that I have this chair, I'm not going to replace it but I have two major complaints about it.  Our son is 20 months old and I still have to put a book wrapped in a dishtowel in the seat so he can comfortably reach the tray or our dining table.  Raising the height doesn't help because the arms of the chair come up so high and so far forward you can't scoot the chair in any closer to a table.  The chair also has a very large footprint--unless you have a very spacious dining area it's hard maneuvering around it.  If I could do it over again, I wouldn't buy this high chair

I'm on child number 2 with this chair, and my complaints are the same.  1. They tray is way too high for an infant/young toddler to reach anything.  My son is 8 months old and he can barely see what is placed on top of the tray.
2.  It is a cleaning nightmare.  I am still finding food from my first born hidden in this chair!  

Good points:
-pop off tray
-divider that keeps them from slipping out
-cool colors

I tried a friend's cheap Evenflo chair and I loved it 100 times better and it cost over 100 dollars less

I received this highchair as a hand-me-down.  Looks lovely, mine is  pale blue and lime green, but is infuriating to clean.  I have never seen more cracks, crevices, screw holes, all where baby food and slobber collect. After one feeding with my hyper 7 month-old the chair is beyond filthy. You will need to buy toothpicks to get in all the crevices.  A friend of mine has a Fisher-Price high chair which is much less complicated and easier to clean.  The price is insane (glad mine was free).  I would never buy this chair even as a gift. I would advise anyone considering this chair to go with something cheaper and easier to clean. I would give it zero stars if I could

I agree with several others about it being VERY difficult to clean. There are so many nooks and crannies. I used it for my daughter and hated it and then tried it again when I had my son and it was no different. My son is 16 months old and has been learning to feed himself and there are times that I do not want to let him practice because I dread how long it takes me to clean after each meal. I went out and bought an inexpensive highchair without all of the bells and whistles and it works great! Now I have more time to spend playing with him instead of cleaning a highchair.

We had to clean this high chair nearly every day and the process itself would take 30 minutes. I am not a neat freek in any way shape or form. But you kind of have to clean this frequently as the food goes into every nook and cranny. If i had to buy another chair I would get a wood one. We have the Eddie Bauer booster now that our son is older. We clean that once a day with a sponge which takes all of 1 minute and take the cushion off for a super clean once a week.
The Prima Pappa is comfortable and secure. In the end I realized that we didn't need all the bells and whistles

First, the adhesive/velcro fasteners which attach this cover to the stroller were inadequate to say the least.  Second, it is opaque, so the kids couldn't even take in their surroundings. Since it resembles a parachute, the only reason that the kids even got fresh air was because the *stupid* thing wouldn't stay attached to the stroller, the kids probably wouldn't have had fresh air. Go for hats and sunscreen/protective garments instead

We LOVE this monitor, but only when it does not have awful interference.  Unfortunately, in the evening for some reason the interference is really bad and all we hear is static off and on for hours.  We do not live in an apartment or townhouse (which I read was not recommended for this product), but we do have wireless internet. Only we aren't using it when there is static, so who knows...

I love being able to see my boy, but the static makes the monitor REALLY annoying

The walker has a few flaws.  First of all the toy bar on the front table is not ideal. It is too close to the child and only a few inches away from the child's head.  My son keeps bumping his forhead on the toybar when he is riding in the walker.....constantly.  The seat is too tight and the crotch area on the seat is too high, it should be roomier and drop lower.

This is a nicely designed walker and my baby likes it for the most part but we are not exactly satisfied by it for one reason. The front wheels turn all directions but the rear wheels don't. Just like a car, it can only go forward and backward, but not sideways. Sometimes my baby turns her upper body to the side and tries to reach something on her left or right but she can't push the walker that way because of the design, and she gets frustrated. If both front wheels and rear wheels were the types that turn any direction, it would have had much greater mobility

I tried to buy a walker for my grandson and all the walkers were unavailiable. You didnt even have one walker availiable, How is it possible that such a big outlet like yours not to have one walker? I was very disapionted. I guess that I would have to rate you with a zero. And I would like to know when will there be any walkers available? I like to shop with Amazon

We couldn't wait until our daughter was ready for a walker.  Unfortunately, after countless times of putting in new batteries, we realized that the toy didn't work.  I immediately contacted Kolcraft and they are sending me another toy.  I also wished I had gotten the one with the mirror, instead I have the one with the spinning toy and my daughter keeps hitting her forehead on it.  And to add to that, she only stays in it for about 15-20 minutes.  Other than that, I really like the walker!  lol :}  I think it will be better once we get a new toy

I saw this and I thought it would be great. It would keep my daughter's food off of a dirty table and catch the food that she drops.  It does do those things but it is hard to clean.  It gets pretty dirty, and in the catching pouch, there are grooves that make it hard to wipe the mess out of.  I used it twice and will never use it again.  I recommend the Table Toppers- they are disposable mats that you stick to the table and throw away when you are done.  They stay in place better, and you can wrap them around the edge of the table so baby will not put mouth on table.  I use the mats with a crumb catcher bib from walmart that catches her messes better that this one did.  Her lap says clean and clean up is a lot easier.  You do not have to worry about putting the dirty mat back into your diaper bag.

I was given this as a gift and I was very excited to use it out and about.  But when we were out in the restaurant they did not stick and my daughter could easily pull it off.  Plus when we were all done, I had to try to clean it off as best I could, then put it in my diaper bag-yuck!
I much prefer the plastic disposable tablemats that stick on the table

[...] to see how worthless the Graco Lovin' Hug swing is.  The baby in the swing is lying perfectly still and is 21 pounds (the swing has a supposed 30-pound limit).  The swing is on hard floors, is brand new, as are the batteries, and still the swing barely moves at all, even on the highest level!  When I contacted the company, they told me that the swing won't go as high when a baby gets larger, but this brief movie proves that it won't "go" at all!!  Instead, I highly recommend the Fisher Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Swing.  I only wish it held a larger baby so I could continue to use it!

The &amp;quot;sticky&amp;quot; pads that are supposed to hold the organizer don't even stick, so every morning I would wake up to find the organizer sitting in a pile on the floor next to the changing table...and this was with absolutely NO items in it.  The organizer doesn't come with any information, so I had no idea if there were alternate ways to hang the organizer or not.  This is a great idea, but it is very poorly constructed.

I got two of these as shower gifts.  I thought that they would be so handy.  WRONG!  The velcro kept slipping and sounded as if it would fall off of the changing table.  The openings that are shown holding the powder and lotion are VERY small.  They will only hold the travel size or the next size up.  It was made cheep. The &amp;quot;shelves&amp;quot; are not sturdy at all.  Save your money!

We purchased this because of the walkie talkie feature between the 2 parent units.  Don't bother.  Whenever any of the 3 units get within 10 feet of each other they let out a squeal that would wake the neighbor's baby!  What's the point of having a feature that allows you to clip the parent unit onto your belt if you can't then walk into the baby's room wearing it without it sounding like a police siren????  

They are getting returned right away.

Tired of hearing your baby cry?  This is the monitor for you.  You'll be lucky to hear any sounds from your baby on this thing.  Looks like Evenflo  was being literal when they named the product Whisper Connect.  You can barely hear anything at full volume.  I'm going to return it tomorrow if I can resist backing over it with our car.

We have the 49MHz Whisper Connect and love it (see our review of that one). We needed a second monitor to replace a 900MHz Fisher Price monitor that is 4+ years old, and decided to try this one out. We set the base across the room from our daughter and had her talk at her normal voice, and we could barely hear here with the volume turned up. We thought we must have a defective unit, so we returned it and got another, and we had the same problem. There is no interference or static with the monitor - but also no sound. We're very unhappy with it and would not recommend it

My son is 5 months old now and for the first 4 months, the monitor worked pretty well.  We got a bit of static from time to time, but I would have given it 4 stars.  BUT...one night I woke up to reassure myself with the little green "on" light and saw that the monitor was not on.  Thinking it was a fluke, I turned it back on, checked the baby and went to bed.  But, over the course of a couple of weeks, it became more and more unreliable, turning off at will.  It was also hard to turn it back on.  I had to flip the switch several times before it would work. And, this is not a battery issue, since it was plugged in the entire time. I went to the Evenflo website and read the FAQs.  There's a mention of a problem with the power light going out, but nothing about the monitor itself going out.  Needless to say, we've thrown it away and have gotten a different brand.  I mentioned this to my friend with an 8 month old the other day and she said the same exact thing happened to hers - just stopped working reliably. She's bought a different monitor too.  Both of our new monitors are working perfectly now with less static.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing this monitor until they make some changes.

I thought I'd try this monitor since it was a 900Mhz and had a far range. Well, I have problems similar to Sara's. When I used the alternate channel to avoid the intermittant loss of signal and beeps, I would get horrible static when my cordless phones rang or were being used. When there was no beeping or loss of signal it's reception was clear. That's why I gave it a 2nd star. This product is going back to the store tomorrow and I will continue my quest to search for the right monitor

I was so excited to buy this stroller. It seemed perfect for my 1 yr old daughter. The mesh back would be ideal for the hot, humid weather. It's light and easy to travel with. It seemed sturdy. Most of this was true until I used it for a month. Honestly, the seat is way too big! My daughter was forever uncomfortable b/c the straps were too loose even at their tightest to hold her and the seat was too deep. With minimal padding (and no recline) she would bump her head on the side frame when riding around. And to top it off, the frame bent after basic use. All we did was take it in and out of the car! I was very disappointed. Maybe this would be a great stroller for a 4 year old, but don't buy this stroller b/c you're looking for something smaller than your Graco(but better than an umbrella stroller) for your young toddler. I think for the price and minimal features it should be of better quality. Every review mentioned the carrying strap b/c that's the ONLY extra feature! This stroller was not for us!

I read all the Amazon reviews but still decided to go with the Avent sippy cup since I had relatively good experiences with the Avent bottles. Unfortunately, leaking is a real problem with these cups. Not only does the milk seem to pour out of the sides no matter how well I try to fasten the lid, but it does not flow easily for my son when he sips. He ends up with a mouth full of milk. So much for my efforts to get him to start using a cup. I orginally used Playtex and he liked that well enough. I only switched because the Playtex valve was hard to clean and easy to tear. Now, after wasting money on Avent, I'll go back to Playtex and hopefully my son will be willing to give sippy cups another try. I don't usually write Amazon reviews but I figured it was worth it in this case to save someone else the trouble. Unless you want milk EVERYWHERE, I would definitely avoid these cups.

I've heard Avent bottles leak but never experienced it myself.  I just bought the toddler cups and 18mths spouts and BOTH link.  Not just a littler either but with every use.  My daughter can shake milk all over the house if she pleases.  I find this odd b/c the 6mths cups don't link at all. I think these products are very hit or miss. You may get a leaky cup or you they may work great. ?

This is an okay product with many, many parts to clean.  The spout, the ring for the top of the cup, the handles, and the plastic "leak stopper", oh, and the cup!  All the parts fly around the dishwahser.  I've lost many stoppers so I've had to order through Avent.  The good thing is they don't leak.

I am so disappointed by another Avent product that is just no good.  Short term or long term these cups are not worth anything since they leak.  My son's cups have leaked on him, on the floor, in his diaper bag and in the car. I don't understand why anyone if they say they have leaked would give this product anything but 1 star.   Mom's have enough too do---running around cleaning after leaky, unreliable products is not fun especially for the price of the Avent Magic Cup.

I too thought that since we had such great luck with Avent bottles, that we would love their "magic" cups. I am constantly cleaning up leaks from these cups.  It seems like the lid and cup don't seal together well enough to withstand any activity. I'm sad to have to give Avent a bad rating, but don't waste your money on these cups

Avent makes the best washable baby bottles around, so we felt that their sippy cups would be just as good. Well we were wrong. Of the five cups we had, all of them leaked and have since been thrown out. The cups are five different pieces vs other brands that use three  pieces, which makes them harder to wash, harder to put together, and more pieces to lose. As far as sippy cups go, these are among the most expensive you can buy and worst that we used out five different brands. We have had great luck with Greber's and Playtex's. Please avoid

I would have rated this item 0 stars, if that were an option.  We discovered approximately a year after installing these that the plastic strap had become so brittle that it snapped in two with little manipulation.  Fortunately, we discovered this because we were moving, not because a piece of furniture fell.  I shudder to think what might have happened if our furniture had tipped

I agree with the first reviewer,"Cindy"--I love the concept, but the proportions on this swaddler just aren't right, unless you have a really tiny baby or one that doesn't kick his/her legs much (my one-month old boy weighs 11 lbs and is 23 inches long.).  The velcro doesn't hold because the patches are too small, and the knit fabric is too stretchy.  However, I put him in the larger size SwaddleMe today, and it fits much better

I am unhappy with this product. My newborn baby is 22" long and weighs 7 pounds. I purchased this item after speaking to the rep about size. I've found that my son can easily get his legs out of the bottom pouch through the opening. I think that if there was a longer strip of velcro instead of the short square, this would be prevented. He also can get his arms out of the top. If the velcro strip could be larger, going more toward the back and side of the product, this would not happen. Maybe my son is more narrow at the top than some children and this is not a problem for many, but I think this would make the product more useable, one size fits all. Also, he is long, and the small size was too cramped. I'm assuming the next size up would have been too wide for him and therefore making it impossible for his arms to stay inside - which is happening anyway. I like the product idea and the fabric and construction,(which is why I gave it 2 stars) but this product did not work for me. I have recently purchased The First Years swaddle blanket, but have issues with that one as well. I am currently searching for one to fit.

     We have had this monitor for 18 months and have zero problems hearing our son in his crib...and apparently our neighbors three houses down from us also have no problem hearing us.  We were outside today when our neighbor who also has a toddler just so happened to mention this to us.  So now we are looking to purchase a more secure monitor.
     If you live out in the middle of no where or you don't mind other people listening to your everyday conversations this monitor is perfect for you

I purchased these monitors thinking I wouldn't need to use them at all since the baby's room is right next door.  I'm glad I did buy them because my son ended up with acid reflux and spit up in his sleep constantly for awhile there, so being able to hear him and go to him is a comfort. Anyways, there are only 2 channels on these monitors, which is a bummer since I live in a big apartment complex.  I get interference of all kinds from telephone conversations to other people's babies crying, which really weirded me out the first time I heard it.  I tried using a battery with it when I brought it with me to check the mail (yes the door was locked, no I am not a bad mother) and was only able to hear static.  I wish I had bought a monitor with more channels.  Note to self:  keep reciepts and packaging from now on!!

(2 stars because the style is cool...)this was a christmas gift from my husband this year as our son is a big boy (19 1/2 lbs @ 4 months)and it was too much to carry him, his carrier and a heavy diaper bag everyday to daycare so this seemed like the perfect solution... and it was... until the bag started coming apart 7 days after I received it! And I was careful, I had read some of the other reviews about the stitches coming apart and I had thought they had just over filled the bag... nope! The bottle holder has ripped all the way down the side... you can't overfill that... there's just room for one bottle, isn't that what it is made for???
My husband really loved this bag because it wasn't 'girly or babyish' but put the $$ on something that will hold a bottle!

I received this toy as a gift for my one year old daughter. I thought it was a wonderful toy, and so did my daughter. After playing a while with it on the floor, my daughter picked it up and started walking around the kitchen with it in her hands, and fell down, and the toy dropped on the floor. At this point the toy started to malfunction. The music would play sometimes and not others. And after being dropped to the floor a couple more times, it stopped working altogether. I think a toy designed for young children should be more durable than this toy turned out to be. Great toy ... but it didn't last long

I used this bag once when traveling and then the zipper completely fell off because it was improperly made, then I got a new bag (customer service was very nice and helpful) and it has a huge rip in the bottom after only traveling with it once and gate checking it (my stroller wasn't damaged), so I have concluded that it is horribly made and a waste of money, still waiting on a refund

I agree with another reviewer, whose information I read only after I'd purchased the clean shopper.  It is impossible to keep track of an unattached strap.  I returned this product as soon as I saw the strap, which you need to attach your child to the cart, is separate from the cover.  This was not specified in the description. Also, it just bothered me that the printed material...the cute jungle animals that are supposed to stimulate your child, not you, for heaven's sake, are printed upside down to their eye.  Sorry, but I have enough to look at when I'm grocery shopping. I am very disappointed that I still do not have a cart cover for my child. The clean shopper was at least reasonably priced. All of the other cart covers I've seen which are large enough to cover the whole cart, and are well designed, start at $60.

I like this humidifier alot but now I cannot find replacement filters for it. I only had it for about 3 months and now I cannot find replacement filters. This unit was not cheap either, it did cost money and now for it to basically be brand new and not to be able to find filters is really fustrating. I would not recommend this humidifier for this reason only

I was so excited when I recieved this humidifier at my baby shower. But after several tries, I finally returned it. This product has a sensor so it turns on and off automatically. Well, the darn thing is so loud that each time it turns on, my baby wakes up crying!!! Note that I live 2 miles from an airforce base, and the planes don't even wake her!!!! Don't buy this product

Too loud and the water evaporates way too quickly. I feel like I'm constantly filling the container w/ water. Though my son is a sound sleeper, it is difficult to hear him through the baby monitor b/c of the loudness of the humidificr. I would not buy this item

I was looking forward to getting this toy for my son. But when I opened it up I was disappointed to see that there were only three tools inside the bag. I thought the picture showed several more tools. Maybe my tool kit was not complete. Either way my son never really showed much interest in it

I bought these bottles thinking that since my daughter likes her soothie pacifier, then this would be a good transition bottle from breast to bottle. WRONG!!! She hated these bottles. I would put the pacifier in her mouth and then try to get her to take the bottle and she would scream bloody murder. I gave these bottles one star because I think it is a good concept but unfortunately didn't work for us. The only bottle she would take was the Playtex bottles with the big nipples that she could grasp good with her mouth

I spent a lot of time researching strollers, and after reading all of the reviews for the Aria I decided to register for one.  Out of the box it was fairly easy to assemble and lightweight, but I have not been pleased with it since.  The shoulder straps on the 5 point harness are cheap and fall out of the back of the seat.  The snack cup has never stayed in place.  Steering this stroller is impossible...we took it to Disney last month and I almost left it in Florida.  All in all I expected a lot more from Peg Perego

With our knobs being on the front of the stove, these covers hung down over the oven door, and either got in the way, or were popped off on a regular basis (or pulled off by our 16 month old). We found it easier to just remove the knobs and put them on the counter when the stovetop wasn't in use

I agree with the other one-star reviewers here -- had I come to Amazon first, I would not have wasted my money.  I got these because our two-year-old grandson was staying with us and, being a curious kid who likes to push every button and turn every knob in sight, he was soon trying to turn on the gas oven and stove.  So we got and installed these covers.  Within minutes he discovered them -- and became even MORE fascinated with the stove!  He immediately began spinning them around on the knobs, and it took less than a minute for him to figure out that if you pull upward, the cover and the knob come right off together!  Now he had a fascinating new "rattle" to carry around -- and probably lose my stove knob in the bargain.  Our solution?  We took the real knobs off the stove, period.  We keep them in a high cupboard and only get one out when we need it to cook.  As for these clear covers, they're are still in the closet -- maybe I can use them to display insect specimens or something?  Useful as knob locks they are NOT

My 15-month-old son pulled these off (and broke one) within about 5 minutes of installing them.  Also, he was able to turn the covers which ended up turning on the gas.

I bought these after we moved because our new house had knobs on the front instead of on the counter surface. THey fit my oven knobs very loosely so my son likes to make them spin around and around. Also a few of my knobs pull off easily. My son just grabs hold of the covers and off they come, both knob and cover. Then it's a neat toy with the knob rattling around inside the cover. They do keep him from turning on the stove so they do what their suppose to. I'm just not sure if it's worth it. It probably depends on your stove

This pump is REALLY slow, and absolutely KILLS your hand. For about the same price get the Avent Isis manual pump, it is WAAAAAAY faster and because of the massaging petals you get way more milk per pump, so it doesn't hurt your hand. I haven't found that it hurts my hand at all, because you use it for way less time and have to pump far less often.

the high walls on the snuggle nest made it impossible to try to breast feed over, and pulling the baby down to the open area as suggested, defeats the purpose of having the walls in the first place.  I would fall asleep breastfeeding and wake up later only to realize my daughter was unprotected.

There is no need for this item.  It is a huge inconvenience to have this big stiff box in the middle of your bed.  I hated having a wall between my baby and me.  When I woke up to nurse, I had to take her out of it anyway.  Co-sleeping is intuitive, naturally safe and easy easy easy... please don't spend your money on this unnecessary complication of a natural arrangement.

I used one of these with my son (he's 3, so it wasn't that long ago) but as I was getting ready to use it again with my daughter, I started thinking about what a pain the Floppy Seat was to use.  Getting it back into it's "bag" was such a hassle I used to just plunk the thing back into the backseat of the car after shopping... which made the convienent small-space self storage a waste of time and money.  This thing is named well, as it really is floppy- floppy to put into the cart and floppy to try to put away again.  

I started reading reviews of other seat covers, trying to find a better option and I sure found it!  I was really hesitant at the price of the Buggy Bagg, but I could tell when I took it out of the box that it was worth the extra money!  I've only had the Buggy Bagg for 3 days and I am already thrilled that I spent the money on it... definitely worth the extra $20!  It is super-well padded and can really, truly be put into the cart with ONE HAND!  (The Floppy Seat needs at least two hands to go well into the cart!)

DON'T waste your money on the Floppy Seat- it's a flop of a product!

One reviewer, though she raves about it, admits its flaw:  it cant be put back into its carrying form.  Indeed, it's a floppy, illconceived mess.  It basically works but there is a much better option out there: the BuggyBag.  

This "floppy" is not an easy one hand install, it doesnt TOTALLY protect the child as A) one belt feeds through to hold baby and cart allowing unnecessary contact (not ALL covers do that as one reviewer proposes) and B)because it doesnt install in one clean drop and doesnt fold into the carrying shape neatly you and baby are in contact with both floppy sides of this floppy mess as you try to flop it in and out of the cart and your car.

After trying the Floppy mess and a MISERABLE seat called the Shop'n'Dine, I've found the BuggyBag to be the perfect solution:  Truly a neat one hand install; easy zip back into its carrying shape; 2 belts (one for baby, one for cart) neat and simply storage options.  (Read my AMApedia article)  

Dont take my word for it, go to a big Baby store and try out both.  Just standing there you'll see that there's no comparison.  I'm... shocked that there are people who liked the Floppy, but SURE they never tried the BuggyBag.

I think the Floppy Seat is a great idea -- aside from the cleanliness factor, my son would be too small to just sit in the regular cart seat area; this way, I can pad him in and he's secure.  However, I find it very difficult to manage.  

I see that the previous reviewer said that she puts it in the cart with one hand -- I say kudos to her because I find it extraordinarily difficult to hold my almost-20 lb. baby in one hand and put the floppy seat in the cart with the other!  The elastic keeps it on when it's on, but it also makes it so that you have to physically stretch it over the sides of the cart... I challenge you to do it with one hand!

Also, I think that the act of strapping the baby in can be dangerous. I am trying to hold him in the seat with one hand and feed the strap through the tiny hole in the back of the floppy seat with the other... you have to really be aware of what your baby is doing because at that point s/he is not strapped in and can easily fall out.

All of that being said, once baby is properly "installed", it does make for a convenient trip down the grocery aisles

The item is sloppy looking and feeling, unlike the photo of the black Ellaroo.  I didn't feel that the baby was secure and she rode so low on my side that one could hardly call it a hip. Maybe I just never got it adjusted correctly but I read the instructions and gave it many tries.  However, on a positive note, I was refunded my money with no problem.  There was a small restock fee which was disclosed up front.  So, I have no problem with the seller.

This is a great pump for a mom who only needs to pump once or twice a day. Let down happens very quickly and I can get 3 oz. in 15 to 20 min. My baby is a month old and I use this pump so I can occasionally leave my baby with a sitter. Geat pump at a great price

I got this as a gift and registered for it for I was pregnant with my daughter. This was the biggest mistake. The canopy does not cover my daughter when she sits in it. To make it recline, is a chore. My husband has the hardest time to unfold and fold it up, not to make fun of him. he only noce thing is the cup holder comes out to make it easy to take her out. But even still it is not a good purchase and do not buy. We did however buy the peg-pergo piko full size stroller even though it is a littl but more money. Well, worth it. I would suggest that and we also have a macleran light weight stroller and that is also very good.

I purchased the Peg Perego Aria stroller last month for my 3rd son.  Needless to say, I have lots of experience in the stroller world.  This was my first Peg Perego stroller purchase as I have used Graco and Maclaren in the past.  I had been using my Maclaren umbrella stroller (which I purchased in 2000 when my first son was 6 months old) and thought I would buy a new stroller since the other was a bit old.  My girlfriend recommended the Aria so I purchased it.  Anyways, it was a huge disappointment.  The steering is AWFUL.  You definately need TWO hands for this stroller.   The stroller is also extrememly "wobbly".  I was shocked as I figured such an "upscale" brand would be quality enough not to wobble so much.  The 5 point restraint is hard to stay in place as the back straps are attached into a little "envelope" type holder but it always comes out as there is no device to actually secure it in place.  It is bulky in that it doesn't fold into a small compact stroller.  I used this 3 times and just gave it away...what a waste of $$. I'm back to using my Maclaren, which looks thrashed but is a wonderful stroller.  I could kick myself for wasting the money.  My advice to you is TEST it out before you buy it!!!(don't rely on the name

I absolutely agree with this review: "You will NOT get your moneys worth..., February 26, 2006"

We bought this stroller per the recommendation of a friend of ours.  We have the sable color, which I see is not sold this year... but I digress.  We have been using this stroller for eight months with our eight month old and are absolutely fed up with it.

My biggest complaint is the steering.  The front wheels slide sideways over any smooth surface and if we're not on a smooth surface, it feels like I am pushing the stroller into a brick wall because they don't rotate to allow me to push the stroller forwards.  I am always backing up and turning in order to get the front wheels to align so I can get where I want to go.  Shopping is a joke with this stroller because I cannot get it to navigate the aisles easily.

The shoulder straps are attached to the back of the stroller with a little plastic tab which, really, doesn't seem like the best way to keep a child's shoulders restrained.  It ends up coming out from the tab holder and my son is virtually only wearing a lap belt.  This is fine now that he is able to handle a 3 point instead of a 5 point harness but when he was younger, this got on my nerves.

The adult cup holder is a joke, so we took it off and my son figured out how to take the kid's cupholder out so it doesn't stay in any longer as well.

Oh, and the thing folding down so that the handlebar catches the sunshade complaint is spot on.  SO FRUSTRATING!  Not a big deal, really, but poor design because the sunshade prevents the handlebar from locking the folded up stroller in the folded up position most of the time.

I just remembered also, that the sides of the padding in the seat area, when I used this stroller with our Graco Snugride car seat,  would bunch up and prevent the car seat from sitting securely.  I would have to prop the edges of the padding in the seat area underneath the arm-rests of the seat area (the parts that say Aria) before I put the car seat into the stroller seat area so that it would sit deep enough to latch onto the cup area and allow the security strap to go over the carseat snugly.

If Peg Perego could fix the steering, I think I would be able to live with the rest of my complaints but the steering factor is enough for me to trash the whole 9 pound thing now that I found another stroller that steers so much easier with my 22 pound 8 month old son

After reading the reviews this sounded like an easy choice.  I was VERY wrong.  When I first plugged it in I could not believe how quickly the wipes heated.  I thought it was great.  I did think they were way too hot after they were in a while... but a quick shake after I pulled one out cooled it down enough to make it safe.  Then a few days later I was pulling them out and the inner lid popped open... and kept popping open with every change.  THEN when I lifed the unit to put new wipes in... my $700 changing table / dresser was flooded and warped! ( I had it replaced!!)   I had not known it because the pad and a basket were on the table, too.  Same problems kept happening. So I called Combi...Customer Service told me the Instruction Manual states that the wipes are to be left in the packaging.  She said that the excess moisture which caused the flooding would be held by the packaging.  Of course I could not measure the amount of fluid... but I am not exaggerating when I say CUPS!  Even if it did hold the CUPS of water.. so when the plastic pacaking is empty and no longer has wipes,  it is filled with excess cups of moisture and then you have to remove that to dispose of it???? And although it is stated... a) there should be a warning to NEVER use wipes not in a package and b) WHY!  I bought a large "bag" of Huggies wipes.. there is no package to pop in.
Second... she told me that the unit is not supposed to stay plugged in all the time.. and that this too, is in the Manual.  So I lookeed at that, too.  Not in the "Usage" part.. but on the back under "Cautions" it states this:  "Unplug power cord when not in use".  Okay.... when you have a newborn.. when are you NOT using your wipes.. LOL!  She said it should be plugged in and unplugged several times a day to keep them warm!!!  I guess a new mom is supposed to schedule that! AND... if that was an acceptable property of the product.. shouldn't there be a switch??  I would have to move the dresser every time.. or get an extention cord, of course!  Crazy! 
Combi gave me, what I consider, ridiculous answers.  They also need to get real when they write the Manual.  
For the record.. I have written a review one other time to rave about my Little Bissell.  This frustrated me so much I HAD to share the info.!!!!!!  Also.. this is baby #4 so I am quite familiar with baby products.

My husband and I purchased this set with my first son, but are going to choose another bottle manufacturer for our second son.  The difficultly we experienced was securing the nipple ring onto the base - it had to be in perfect alignment or there were definately leaks, sometimes more than that.  It is quite frustrating when you are conducting late night feedings or traveling.  I hope a new second chose will brings easier bottle feedings

I used these through out my daughter's infancy, largely because I bought a whole set of them, the milk storage contraptions, the breast pump, and the pacifiers.  Plus once she was used to the pacifiers and nipples she wouldn't take any other kind.  
But the bottles routinely leaked, ruining several diaper bags, clothing, and nighttime feedings. 
Apparently you have to screw the cap on just right- which is really difficult at 3 AM! 
My daughter didn't seem to have the gas and colic that other reviews talk about, but we did use quite a bit of gas medicine between 3 and 6 months. 
All in All, I think the paci's are great, the rest of it I could do without.

The ideas for the bottles interchanging is great. But unfortunately the nipples cause too much gas.  When they're using the bottle, you can hear constant air sucking in around their lips.  Every time my little girl uses them, it seems as though she just can't get comfortable with them.    I would recommend Dr.Brown's or Playtex VentAire bottles over any of these. 

Ultimately, the convenience and features aren't worth the massive amount of gas the avent bottles cause

I started my newborn out using the Avent bottles.  After a few weeks, she began crying alot.  You could hear the gas moving in her tummy, and every time her tummy would grumble, she would pull her legs up and shriek in pain.  She would also pass gas constantly.  It was so difficult to feed her because she would cough, spit and cry the whole time. Then she would be miserable with gas pains for hours afterwards.  I tried switching formulas - didn't work.  Tried mylicon, Zantac, gripe water, bicycling her legs, etc. etc. etc... nothing worked.  The pediatrician diagnosed her with colic and said there was nothing we could do, that she would outgrow it.  Finally, we decided to switch bottles (I switched to Playtex nursers.)  Instantly we noticed a difference!  She was extremely quiet during feedings, didn't squirm or cry!  She began ingesting almost TWICE as much formula per feeding(probably because her tummy was too full of gas to take in any more with the Avent bottles!) and would go longer between feeds. And when she swallowed, it sounded different - you could tell that she was no longer swallowing air!  Something about those Avent bottles made her swallow tons of air.  I think it was the suction that was created inside the bottle as she ate.  With the Playtex nursers, the liner inside the bottle contracts as she eats, eliminating any air bubbles.  She is a completely different baby now.  She is more alert and interacts with us much more because she spends less of her awake time crying.
So if you decide to buy these bottles - BEWARE.  If you are already using them and your baby has colic, switch immediately!  Don't just assume that colic is "normal" or will be "outgrown."  Babies don't deserve to suffer this way!!!

I bought the Avent bottles when I was pregnant because they were babiesrus's "Best Pick" Yeah right! I wonder how many are returned on a daily basis. Aparently this company spends all their time and money on advertising and not enough on preventing their bottles from leaking! I would not recomend these bottles unless you like waisting your money

The idea for this product is great.  The problem is with its design and/or choice of materials regarding the buckles.

The buckles are plastic and as such they bend and flex.  This caused one of the buckles to regularly separate when any weight was applied to the strap as the outer teeth were not rigid enough to stay in place.  They instead tended to bend towards the center of the male end of the buckle causing it to slip out of the female end of the buckle which then caused the car seat to fall off the luggage.

If another material had been used for the buckles or another type of buckle or fastener was used this product would have been perfect

This sounded like a great item.  However, it has proven to be useless.  First, it won't stop a child from opening the door.  Second, when the door is opened, the guard falls out. When the door is opened the guard is supposed to block the door from being shut, thus the child can't pinch their fingers.  However, the "catch", which goes behind the door, is too small, enabling it to fall through.

I bought this product for my 3 month old for Christmas and when I went to play with it, the remote didn't work. I did everything it said to do and it still didn't work. So, I took it back and just exchanged it for another thinking it was just faulty. When I took it out, the remote to it also didn't work. It says it has to be on "Play" (not Try me or Off) and it has to do it's short musical fanfare after you push the button on the front and then you can use the remote but nope. You should be able to control the volume, the song options, and be able to switch from colors to music but no. It just plain doesn't work. I really want it to work because it would be great in the car but sadly, I will have to take it back but this time I'll get my money back......I do not suggest buying this product

Our 4 month old loved this toy, at first.  But we have had to replace the batteries so frequently that in the end it didn't work more than it did.  Runs through batteries much too quickly. Also, unable to start it from the remote control so we had to reach over the carseat and push the button to begin. But now it is in the trash because I touched the straps holding it up and they disintegrated into blue dust.  Not very safe.  Very disappointed

I was really hopeful about this diaper bag when I ordered it through Amazon.  The size is small and convenient, but I found it awkward when placing it around my arm and neck.  Also, the clasp broke after I had it for only 2 weeks!  I am really disappointed, and would recommend looking elsewhere for a diaper bag.

The third time I wore it, as I tried to zip the bottom-most compartment with one hand (other arm is carrying my 14-month-old), the plastic piece on the main strap simply broke, and pieces just flew off and now it is completely unusable. I do not recommend this product because of its poor construction

I bought this hoping it would help me organise all my baby diapering needs. Unless you have a changing station (or crib, wherever you want to hang it) that has slits or slots able to hold it - the velcro will NOT hold it well. And the "shelves" are a bit insecure. It's a great idea, but just didn't pan out.

I saw this at the store, and I just had to buy it.  I loved all the little pockets for storing different things; it would keep all my baby changing gear and other necessities all in one place.  The picture on the cover shows it stocked full and hanging on the side of a dresser, which can be used as a changing table.  What a marvelous concept!  So, I took it out of the package, attached it to the dresser and put all of my gear onto it.  It looked very smart hanging there, and so practical!  When I came in the room the next day, it was on the floor in a crumpled lump.  So, a little disheartened, but not wanting to give up, I hooked it up to my crib, instead.  It was the next best thing and I really did like the device.  I put all of my gear on there once more, the wipes on the top shelf just like the picture, but the top shelf is so flimsy that the wipes topple off of it.  So, not only can I not hook it up to my changing table, I also can't keep all of the changing gear on it.  This essentially makes this ill-made product completely worthless for the purpose it was designed.

I purchased this diaper organizer to hang on my Delta Luv changing table, because there was no storage space on top. I had high hopes for it--Munchkin products are usually high in quality. However, the cloth on this organizer sags. When I tried to fill it with my wipes box, baby powder, and lotion--as shown in the picture--the pockets tipped forward and everything fell out. I wouldn't want a toddler getting near this organizer! A much safer option is the plastic "Diaper Depot" by Prince Lionheart

Even though it comes with instructions, it is way too complicated to use. I was hoping to use it around the house but you need to know some acrobatics and balancing skills to get the baby securely in this thing. Not to mention, it shrunk 2 feet after I washed it (following the instructions, mind you). Now I have to tighten it in the back versus the front. It's now destined for the donation pile. The Baby Bjorn is easier to use.

I bought the volo after reading many reviews. However, it was utter disappointment. As soon as I took out the stroller from a box, and the carrying strap was off with broken piece of plastic holding piece. Yes, the stroller is light, and very very flimsy. I returned it right away

We purchased this stroller for its convenience in the car and for frequent travel. I think it's safe to say that we have an ambivalent relationship with the Volo, not including my 12 month old daughter who would give it a definite thumbs down.
On the up side it is very light and folds easily and is compact. Not to mention that everyone gets to see you have a Maclaren stroller in a wonderful shade of orange. The stroller is great for the airport and quick shopping trips when you are in and out of the car.
We first purchased the volo without springing for the seat pad. This was a mistake as our daughter was clearly uncomfortable and was unwilling to spend significant time in the stroller. The seat pad did increase her comfort level but she still grows tired of the volo much more quickly than her larger stroller. I think this has to do with the fact that she is not very upright in the volo and cannot shift much in the seat as it offers no support. On top of it, the velcro on the seat pad becomes unhinged each time you fold the stroller - a minor annoyance but a hassle all the same. The awning offers very little sun protection. The mesh cargo area holds very little and is difficult to access. On top of that, you need to empty it completely in order to fold the stroller.
When it comes to travel the volo leaves much to be desired. With limited cargo room, it becomes quite unstable if you hang anything on the handles. It has no recline making it difficult for children to sleep well - a problem when you want to spend the day wandering. Further, while it is great to have such a lightweight stroller when getting it in and out of the car, riding escalators and getting on and off the bus, the Volo flounders once you get off well-paved surfaces. We encountered potholes, dirt paths, cobblestones and sand in our tavels and the Volo was a disaster. The wheels would spin erratically and catch in large divets and gutters. Locking the front wheels so they would not swivel provided little relief. Cobblestones were particularly disastrous as the stroller was so hard to manage and such an uncomfortable ride that we ended up carrying both the child and the volo.
If I had to do it over, I would opt for a compact stroller that weighs a bit more but offers larger wheels, easy-access storage and a supported reclining seat

We just purchased these after our 3 year old worked out how to open the covers by Safety 1st and Parents.  This cover lasted about one minute.  Seriously!  By the time my husband was placing the third cover in our hallway of doors, my son had opened the first one my husband had installed.  The tapered end makes this cover the easiest of all for little hands to open.

I installed this mirror in our car two days ago.  Today it was in my daughter's lap when I went to get her out of the car.  The mirror broke off from the base.  I bought it because it seemed safer than the other types of mirrors (suction cup attachment, etc).  I would not recommend this product

Bought this mirror at target, along with many other Eddie Bauer baby products available there.  This mirror is hard to install, and everytime you hit a bump it falls down, rendering it useless.  It is just very poorly made from cheap materials.  I am very disappointed with the Eddie Bauer line at Target.  Almost every Eddie Bauer product I bought ended up breaking in a week or I just returned due to such poor design.  Target needs to stop selling these items, they are a waste of money

we bought this mirror because of the swivel feature - which worked a little too good.  the mirror kinda sticks out so that every time i got in the back seat to get baby out, i'd hit it and knock it out of place, so i had to readjust it all over again.  sometimes when we'd hit bumps, it would fall and become worthless. finally, my little girl's arms got long enough that she could reach it, and it ended up breaking.

We received this thermometer as a baby shower gift.  For a few months it worked very well...easy to use.  After about 8 months it started acting strange, giving us inaccurate readings.  The final straw was when the thermometer read 104.8 degrees sending us to the ER at midnight only to find out our son's temperature wasn't even over 100.  The thermometer ended up in the trash can on our way out of the hospital.

When I purchased these drapes, I assumed that they would match the tan plaid material used in the Zanzibar valences, sheets, etc. Wrong! The material is striped, and is a darker, different shade of brown than the rest of the set. I love the other items in this set, but don't waste your money on these drapes--they look awful

I bought this buggy board because I was told it was better than my previous wood buggy board (wheel kept unscrewing)... however, I have two strollers I like to use so I had to pay 30 extra dollars to get a second set of connectors to attach it to my second board.  Today I called customer service because one strap broke... I was told it is normal if you live in a cold climate - in my case Manhattan - for the rubber to snap and break...?????? - luckily my daughter was not on it at the time! I was told not to use it in cold weather... I only use it on the weekends anyway so it's not out a lot and it snapped in less than three months.  Please save yourself money and grief and get another board

So I recieved this as a gift at my babyshower even though I didn't register for it and finally pulled it out to use it the other day now that my son is older and we're moved into the larger tub only to find out that it doesn't stick to the wall. At first I thought maybe it was my older son bumping it whenever he was taking a shower, but oh no that's not it at all. Then I thought maybe it was that I had something too heavy inside when really all I had were some rubber rings and I think maybe one tube of crayola draw on the walls crayon. But yet again, the darn thing came un-stuck. So basically the moral of this story is whenever you recieve something that you didn't register for, investigate whether or not it's not a piece of garbage before you open up the box and get past the point of no return. Literally.

The whole purpose is to store toys up off the floor of the tub, but that is impossible since it won't stick to tile above the tub.  I hadn't even put any toys in it, and it wouldn't stick.  I returned it and found something on "One Step Ahead".

The suctions are pretty weak, dont stick well to the tray.  Also had a hard time keeping the arch standing up. The arch kept bending forward and falling in my sons face.  When I was able to get the suctions to finally stick, as soon as my son would touch it, it would bend right above the suction part and it would end up in his face.  They should have added some kids of reinforcemnt so that it could stand upright all the time. I took this back the next day. I bought the Sassy Fascination Station instead.  It has a giant suction at the bottom and serves its purpose, even I had a hard time pulling it off the tray.

I read other reviews that said it was headache, but I went ahead and purchased this item because it's less expense than anything I else I saw. I should have listened... I ordered it in Feb, it is now May and we still don't have the dresser together. There were pieces missing, and a major piece broken. When you try to call, the line is busy. I had to hang up and redial, what felt like forever. They said my piece would come in 3 weeks, it was more like 7 weeks. The piece that was broken had the drawer rails on it, but when it came, it had no rails. So, I said I wanted to return the entire thing, they were fine with it, but it can take up to 8 weeks to get your money back.  So, at this point in time, we are going to go to the hardware store to buy what we need so that I can have a dresser in my son's room.

This item is packaged horribly. If you are lucky enough to get intact a great product for a great price. Received changing hutch and tower, crib and toybox intact. Very happy. Ordered this dresser twice, both times damaged. Good luck trying to put back in crummy box to return and good luck trying to get damaged parts replaced unless you can wait 6-8 plus weeks. My suggestion is to order two dressers, take the best pieces from each, and return the rest. Believe me, you will be glad you did

I have a feeling that this item is simply not packaged correctly.  The two main parts, left side board and right side board, both came in totally cracked.  When I called in to order replacements, the customer service rep knew exactly what I'm calling to re-order.  ?!?!?!  If it's a known problem, why not fix it?!  

The customer service reps are very nice, but the fact that the spare parts take forever to ship really doesn't make this product very attractive.  The processing itself takes 2-3 weeks.  In my case, 3 weeks later, I found out that my 2 parts are on back-order, awaiting shipment by container from Brazil.  So it will be at least 2 more weeks until they arrive and 1 more week until I receive it.  I hope the dresser arrives before the baby...

I have had nothing but problems with this company.  I was missing bolts for an item.  I contacted the company but it took me a month to get back to me.  They then told me that I need to pay 10 dollars because the parts were not under warranty.  Took care of that, but still waiting on bolts. Order the piece in December, it is now April and still not able to assemble

Do not order this item! I ordered and returned this item FOUR times due to cracked pieces. Storkcraft either has very poor quality control or an inability to provide adequate packing to avoid shipping damage. I refuse to reorder a fifth time so now my nursery will have to have mismatched furniture. What a disaster and diappointment

This brand is just awful!  It's made of cheap, flimsy particle board.  It dents and dings very easily.  Most inportantly, the runners are too narrow for the wheels so the drawers fall out.  Not only is it horribly made, but it's dangerous!  DO NOT BUY!

I have used these bottles fot two weeks with my newborn and I am not impressed.  My daughter was very difficult to burp and was vomiting frequently because of trapped gas.  I experimented with the Dr. Brown bottle and the Playtex Vent-Air.  Both seemed to help but the Playtex is by far the best.  People complain about the extra pieces but it is worth it to have a baby who is comfortable

I used to love these bottles until the nipple collapsed twice while feeding my 4 month old daughter, causing almost the entire bottle to spill in her mouth and nose.  The first time it happened I thought I didn't screw the top on, but then it happened again.  After doing some research, this is a common problem with these bottles.

As a nursing mother I researched many different brands of bottles to find the easiest one for my little one to make the transition.  I read from so many sources that Soothie would make the transition the easiest for babies.  I bought a starter kit and several other bottles.  I was greatly dissapointed to learn that out of all the bottle that I purchased only one did not leak.  I tried repositioning the nipple and I tried to tighten the lid.  Nothing helped.  My son was soaked everytime we tried to use them.  I switched to another brand and now we are very dry

I bought this for my grand-daughter, and here is my daughter's reviews of how this product is working (or not)  "Hmmmmm.... she LOVES the music more than the potty itself.  We listen and dance to the "potty" song everyday- but there has been little progress with the actual potty.  I think the way to go for her may be the attachable seat that goes on top of the real toliet.  Otherwise she carries the potty around from room to room and treats it like a seat.  I think getting something that looks more like a real toliet would have worked better. Or perhaps she was going thru a phase that is not over yet, so maybe she will get into it again after a few weeks.  Thanks, anyway."   I don't find this very encouraging, so I wish I had purchased something else.

I bought this item because the FAQ on the breathable baby website said that the bumper would fit any style crib, including ones with solid headboards.  However, once I received the bumper, I realized it clearly does not work with cribs with a solid headboard.  Upon writing customer service at breathable baby for advice on how it would fit, I was told the following:

"The Breathable Bumper will wrap if your crib has a space on either side of the corner posts. If it does, wrap around the outside of the posts. If the Breathable Bumper won't fit your crib you should try the CribShield which has four separate pieces so you can eliminate the foot and head board pieces and just use the long rail sides. Look online and see that the crib must have straight railings and not too thick so the padded rail cover can fit and attach over it." 

When I responded that this information was basically too little too late, and that it disagreed with what they said in their FAQ's, I was then told:

"The other option moms have been doing is buying 2 Breathable Bumpers and using the short pieces on front and back rails. This way they have the padding. In the future, we will be selling them as a package that way, but for now you can still have the safety and comfort you desire."

I think it's really poor customer service to mislead the customer into buying an item and then tell them in order to make it work, they need to purchase a different item or more of the same.  Customer Service at Breathable Baby has since removed the misleading FAQ, however, I now am inconvenience with returning the item.   I am truly disappointed and wish they could be more upfront on their website about the abilities of the product.

I ordered this three times and each time the same piece was broken. The first two times I ordered it through walmart.com because it's cheaper, but they wouldn't replace the part. The third time I ordered it through babyage.com and was able to replace the part, but I'm still waiting on it. This is a beautiful armoire and matches my nursery set, but it's a major pain. I originally ordered it in July and to re-order and send it back three times has taken 5 months. My son is now 3 months old without an armoire or any kind of dresser

I was very excited to receive the Armoire this past weekend.  However, after opening the package we found a crack on one of the pieces.  I called Strokcraft directly to see what the alternatives were for this type of issue.  The only way to compensate for the issue was replacement of the part. The rep indicated that the delivery of the new part can take anywhere from 3-4 weeks.  With the baby coming in within a week or so, who has the time to wait. The product is what you pay for.

I was very disappointed in the product.  The picture does not accurately represent the armoire.  The entire back is just cardboard paneling and the inside of the armoire is white plywood, not cherry wood at all.  The pictures should show the inside view of the cabinet, in addition to the outside.  Also, pieces did come chipped, cracked and one piece was also split into two!!! I returned the item and wish I hadn't ordered in the first place

This potty is completely useless.  It is so small that my three years olds' knees are up by his shoulders when he sits on it.  It is unstable on those little plastic legs and it's opening is too small for their little bottoms and it hurts them to sit on it.  This potty only stands about four inches off the ground so unless your toddler is the size of a six month old this thing is useless

I was so excited to find a portable potty b/c we like to travel and my son is finally potty training. Well I opened it for the first time about 4 months ago and what a disappointment!  My son is 2 and absolutely could not stand sitting on this the first time. It's too small and pinches. I tried to maneuvere his bottom so that it would be more comfortable. no positioning worked.  if your child has a tiny bottom then go for it, otherwise, skip this one

I took this on a short trip, it proved useless. It's unstable, has a sharp edge which cuts into the baby's bottom -- I can't understand how anyone would be expected to sit on this... especially a potty-training child? 

My daughter was fairly young when we tried it (we did some early PT, and she was about 10 months old). She's now 2, fully pt, but will still not go near it. If it was so flimpsy for a 10 months old, how would it do under the weight of an older child? Beyond me.

I still give it 2 stars, because it's an otherwise neat idea. Impractical execution, though

This piece took forever to assemble, arriving in no fewer than 30 pieces. The directions are vague... everything in the diagrams is a rectangle! But the actual parts aren't labeled, so you never know which of the 7 types of rectangular parts they mean. When finished, all of the front slats between the drawers fell out anytime we moved it... they have no bolts to hold them in, the just sit in shallow slots. The drawers are shaky and the whole unit is unstable. Also, as many of the holes are not lined up, so I couldn't even put in some of the bolts.

I used this when I became too sore to use my electric pump.  The milk seeps under the pump guard and it leaks out from the edges onto clothes. I wouldn't even say getting this as a pump for when you're on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up. I had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing (which it says you can do).   They don't sell just that one little piece so I had to buy the actual pump again as a part.  It cost nearly $30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it.  The entire system just isn't durable or made for much use.  Also, cleaning down into the bend of this pump thoroughly is practically impossible.

I thought these would be great specially for the $ but I was soo WRONG!! I've only washed them once, to have everything clean b/f baby gets here and they are covered in fuzz balls!! The fleese is covered in lil balls and strings of balls, way to many to even remove by hand- And on top of that on some of the edges the layers just came apart at the seam!!!It looks like a 20yr old fallen apart hand-me-down after one wash!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!

This lock works good for a little while, then the push mechanism breaks.  It may or may not break completely off, so it could still work even when it breaks.  I've gone through two of these already, and they only lasted a few months before they broke

I have about an inch and a half of space between my lazy susan and the adjacent bank of drawers.  If I install this lock, the base of it will block one of the drawers from opening.  It also means that I would have to drill into the formica trim on the cabinet.  I'm returning it

Once we took this net out of the box I knew it wouldn't work. Our balcony railing was not only longer, but shorter in height, than the net so we had to wrap it around the top railing. The &amp;quot;strings&amp;quot; used to secure the net did not look strong enough to me and the whole set up looked ridiculous. I am searching for an alternative

After 5 boys my first daughter just HAD to have a pink highchair for her Princess 1st Birthday Party so I retired the boys trusty BLUE Graco (still in great shape after 4 years) into the basment and ordered this Pink one.  After what we paid for it ~ I don't know how to tell my husband I want the blue one back! (Maybe I can fnd a pink cover?!)  My daughter is 12 months old &amp; 20 pounds and cannot reach the tray without dropping food into her lap.  There is a 3inch gap between her &amp; the tray so half her food she tries to feed herself drops into her lap.  The thick padded seat is adorable &amp; comfy for her but it has such deep crevices you really have to dig deep to get every crumb cleaned up.  The base is very large &amp; her food falls down onto it after every meal so I am not only cleaning the floor but the base as well.  The buckles are awkward &amp; impossible to do with one hand. If you have a petite baby ~ this is not the highchair for you

I really don't like this high chair at all. My little girl is 10 months old and 19 lbs and she CANNOT sit in this chair without me putting a pillow or towel under her so that she can reach. When sitting on the regular seat, she is so low that she cannot get her arms above the tray to feed herself. This is a huge pain because I have to constantly take out the pillow or towel that she must sit on top of...out to clean. A 10 month old should be able to comfortably sit in a high chair. I have had her in friends high chairs that are a Graco and she fits perfectly. If I could do it over, I would have opted for a less expensive model that she fits in properly. Don't buy this product!

Don't waste your money on this high chair.  By the time your infant can safely sit in it, they will have almost outgrown it.  You're just paying for the name brand, not the quality.  Stick w/ a Graco instead

Our baby boy loves jumping and swinging but this product is not well designed (and I'm an industrial designer Dad, so I should know!). It can hit the door frame easily, the seat is way too deep even though our baby is above average height. He's banged his mouth a few times into the hard plastic portion when he swings in or jumps in it. He has fun in it at first, but it always seem a disappointment in the end. Save your time and money and get the Baby Einstein Excersaucer. THAT is agreat toy and better for development skills

Serious Warning: Consumer Reports, the independent consumer magazine, called a specific model of this walker, model 14565, "unacceptable" because it's unsafe.  (See their Dec. 8, 2006 blog on their website.)  Anohter similar model, 14570, is okay.  Model 14565 is deemed unsafe by CR because it does not prevent the walker, and the baby, from falling downstairs as it should.  CR points out that the 14565 is still in the retail channel.  Unfortunately, it's impossible to tell which model Amazon is selling.  Your best bet is another brand or check one out in a retail store.  Be sure to avoid model 14565

This thermometer is totally worthless. It doesn't read the correct temp. on myself, husband or baby. When my little one was sick at 3 months old, this thing read 96.7 degrees on all three of us. I picked up a digital 'under the tongue' type and simply used it under his arm. Works great--cost me $3.  
  
 I can't GIVE this one away

I have looked EVERYWHERE and there are no probe covers to be found ANYWHERE!  Who would sell a $30 thermometer that can only be used 20 times!  This is insane.  If anyone finds them, please let me know where.  I have checked BabysRUs, USA Baby, Wal-Mart, Target, Walgreens, Snyder's Drugstores, every grocery store, every discount store, every drugstore I have been to in two states over the last 3 months.  This is crazy.  I recommend not getting it

I have only found ONE place to buy probe covers for this thing - so I bought a lot. They aren't the same manufacturer - but they are the exact type of probe covers. Hope this helps others looking for covers for this. If the first years doesn't sell probe covers for this anymore - they shouldn't let companies sell the thermometer either.

Not only are probe covers unavailable in retail locations or over Internet, it seems that First Years has discontinued the product. At least the product is not listed or mentioned on their website. We searched for model 4290 - the number imprinted on the bottom of the thermometer. Apparently, they don't see any value in telling customers the product was discontinued. Furthermore, the site is full of broken image links.  
  
 The thermometer works well but without probe covers, it's not a good investment. You can find equivalent products with readily available probe covers. If the store you're buying the thermometer at doesn't have covers there, find another product with covers available

I purchased this item after hearing comments that a unit that heats from top down works better.  I was highly disappointed with this unit as it does not heat the entire wipe, wipes must always be filled to the top and the wipe cools down too quickly.  Unfortunately I don't have the original box therefore cannot return the item.  I am now going to purchase a warmer that is sold from One Step Ahead that also heats wipes from top down but is not something that attaches to a wipe box.  Through friends I have heard this other unit works great and have been reassured that I won't be disappointed.  Hopefully BabiesRUs will sell this other item in the future

The idea of a nice warm wipe is great, but the product falls short in perfomance.  The warmer is designed for a non-popup type of wipe box. (If you use pop up wipes, just the part sticking out of the box gets warm, and the rest is cold.  If you use the other type of wipe box, it works ok as long as you always keep the wipe box full, which isn't always realistic for a moms and dads.  I am returning mine to the store.  :

I purchased this wipe warmer because I didn't want a warmer that heats all the wipes.  Those cause the bottom wipes to dry out and thus be useless.  The top down warmer is supposed to heat only the top few wipes. Well, this warmer only heated the top section of the top wipe that sticks out of the top of the box.  It didn't even heat the whole wipe!  I am returning the warmer.  It is a complete waste of money

First, I agree with other reviewers who say that this helps their baby's sleep better.  That I cannot deny.  Our two+ week old little girl seems to love it and seems to sleep for longer stretches on it without waking.  However, the trade off in better sleep is NOT worth the risk.  I woke up last night to find that she had slipped down and her face was right between the bolsters.  She could have easily suffocated!  This is a very common complaint with this product (both here on Amazon's web site as well as on Target's web site where there are many parents who have reporting having the same scary moment that I had).  Some reviews seem say that if you have a real squirmy older baby that that is the true problem with this product.  I have to tell you that that is not quite the case.  Our little two week old is tightly swaddled at night and doesn't move a whole lot - yet she slipped down to a position where she could have suffocated.  The bolsters were very tight to her sides and so that doesn't explain things either.  If you choose to purchase this product, please be very careful with it.  I understand that those of you who have infant with reflux don't really have a choice about this but I recommend that you try it first in the daytime with your infant closely supervised so you can see if they are likely to slip down.  As for us, we may try to keep using it by elevating the bottom a little with a blanket underneath but we are absolutely getting rid of the bolsters.

My daughter is only two months old and she slides off this thing all the time.  I even tried to put a towell to make it less steep, but it didn't work.  Worst yet, her head would slide off the edge.  I guess it will work for baby who is small and less than one month old and does not move around

I like the concept of an elevated design.  They should make the sides breathable.  I have had my son sleeping on this since he came home.  This has been 6 weeks so far.  He twitches and moves his legs and arms, and such.  Typical baby stuff.  He ends up slidding down in between the wedges.  I tried putting a rolled up towell at his feet to keep him up.  You would be surprised how tight he pulls his legs in.  He slides no matter what.  When I put the towell to high his head slid off the edge.  Good Idea needs work

This product has been a disappointment. The pillow portion is good in theory only. The baby's head tends to fall off the edge more times than not! So the baby is on the sleeper and the head is hanging off the top edge to the left or the right! Wouldn't recommend, good concept, bad design

My wife purchased this toy box at our local Toys R Us.  It went together fine, but ours must have been factory defective because the entire thing smelled like WET PAINT.  In fact, we had to return the unit because the fumes were making our daughters cry whenever they went into their room.

Little Tykes makes this unit, but they were of no help when I called customer satisfaction.  They told me just to return it and that they've never heard of this problem.

The toy box is nice, but im not happy with the product. The directions were difficult to understand and I didn't like the top being made of cloth material. My little boy already made a tear on it. I had to remove it, I was afraid my little boy would tear it

HI I bought this seat thinking it would be great with the arm extension. I was so wrong! If your tub isnt made just right then it will not work and the seat itself is not secure. There are no suction cups to hold the seat in place either. I ended up breaking the arm lever off just so the seat would set level in the tub. But I have since purchased the aquababy seat ring and love it. It has the suction cups on the bottom and a release lever also toys on the front so baby can play. So if you are searching for a bath seat I dont recommend the safety 1st at all

Unless you have an older/inexpensive bathtub, this won't work. The side pad won't open wide enough to fit on a thicker rim and the seat won't go deep enough. Too bad. It looked great!

We bought this tubside seat just today and tried it out for the first time with our baby, who is 5.5 months old and just sitting up on his own.  

Initially it looked great, seemed very sturdy and we thought he would love being able to sit and play with his toys.  However, getting him in and out we noticed that the plastic edges around where his legs go is actually very sharp, and as our baby is on the tall end of the spectrum, it was impossible to get him in and out of the seat without scraping up his little legs and knees. 

It's not as if he is going to get any shorter, so I don't think there is any solution to the problem.  I think Safety 1st could have done a better job of making the plastic in that area more comfortable, or even put some padding at that location.  I'm surprised more reviewers didn't have this problem.  For our baby, who normally loves bathtime, it was a painful and frightening experience.

We will be returning the item.  Since you can't leave your baby unattended in water anyway, we might as well just get a non-slip mat and hold him until he gains more balance.  I recommend you save your money on this one

My mother inlaw bought this dresser for us as a gift for her first grandson. As most parents can imagine knowing your going to be a first time mom, can be a very very exciting feeling.

When we recieved our dresser, we did not open it right away. Once we decided to get the nursery together and my husband opened the box, to our surprise the right side panel was completely split in half. 

We called stork craft and reordered the part. The representative advised us that the part will take 2 weeks before it can be shipped to us. My husband and I wait a little more than 2 weeks and still no right side panel. I then called again and the same representative stated that it will take another 2-3 weeks before the package can be shipped. 

That same day I called Amazon and before the week was over we had a brand new dresser delivered to our house. Til this very day we are still waiting for the right side panel.

My suggestion- Please read every review before purchasing any items rom fSTORK CRAFT......... There furniture and customer service is not reliable. OUR BABIES DESERVE BETTER........... DON"T YOU THINK

I ordered this online and got the pieces in the mail.  3 pieces were damaged so we called the manufacturer for replacements.  They said it would take 2 to 3 weeks.  Its been 3 weeks, when I called again they said it would take another 2 weeks.  How hard is it to get replacements?? My baby is due anytime now and the changing table is still in pieces.  Would like to get the nursery done, preferrably before my child goes to college.  We purposely ordered it early to give us time, but apparently that wasnt enough.  I tell you its very frustrating and so not worth it.

I have had nothing but problems with this company.  I was missing bolts for an item.  I contacted the company but it took me a month to get back to me.  They then told me that I need to pay 10 dollars because the parts were not under warranty.  Took care of that, but still waiting on bolts. Order the piece in December, it is now April and still not able to assemble

Well, they say that you get what you pay for.  That would be true if you can find this on sale for $50 of less!  If you are used to particle board furniture, this will suit you fine.  If you have higher standards, spend more and avoid this.  Some of the pieces cracked as screws went into the pre-drilled holes in the particle board.  Several pieces arrived damaged.  We had to request 3 replacement parts from the manufacturer and are still not happy with it, but now it is assembled and impossible to ship back so we are stuck with it.  If you do buy this and get it assembled, try not to move it around too much, as it may fall apart.  Also, the drawers are very shallow.  Don't expect to store much in this.  It did arrive promptly, but the shipper and Target would have done me a favor if they had lost it instead of delivering it

I could go into a long explanation of how I searched and did tons of research before buying an occasional use pump for myself, who is a stay at home mom.  I could explain in detail about everything I did to try and get this pump to work, in the meantime before figuring out the motor was not working, of how I was freaking out my supply was dwindling so I went out to buy fenugreek.....But, suffice it to say, the motor lasted me 3 months of once, twice a week useage.  It didn't completely die, which is why it took me a while to figure it out, but after paying attention, I could see the vaccum losing more and more power until when I couldn't even get a quarter ounce from one side and I was nearly engorged..!!!  

At least Medela is shipping me out a new motor, this one I hope will at least last longer.  Especially since my warranty runs out in 2 months (6 month total warranty- which to me is too little for a product that costs over $100!!)  Even though I'm staying at home and only use the pump occasionally, I wish I'd just spent the extra $150 and gotten a Pump in Style!

I used this pump less than 10 times with my first child and just got it out to use with my second since I'm engorged and found out the motor is broken.  I'm very disappointed since I trusted the Medela name.  If I could afford it, I'd replace it with the Pump-in-Style, but unfortunately, I'll have to try a manual pump

I bought this pump the day I was discharged from the hospital (12/11/05). I have used it on a part time basis since I am staying home and nurse directly. However, the motor broke and couldn't pump anymore. My baby is only 5 months and this pump already broke. I have only used it during nights to keep a storage for my baby. I was lucky to call Medela on time since this pump is still under its 6 month warranty period so I could get my money back.

This is not a good product unless you're willing to screw one of the parts into your door, which we were not since it was a newly installed hi-quality door; and the way the door was designed was not conducive to doing so.  As a result, the double-backed tape which was required for the use of this product quickly came off.  You can't really expect a piece of plastic which is held to a wooden door with just two-sided tape to withstead the pressures of a person (large or small) trying to open the door.  It just isn't going to hold up.

It's a nice try, but in the end was a waste of my money

I ordered two of these cots for twin 4-year-old grandsons to use when staying at my home. I expected the cots to be fairly sturdy, perhaps along the line of a porta-crib. Instead, the frame doesn't lock in place and looks like it would bend fairly easily. The twins tried them out -- after being cautioned not to jump on them; the cots didn't look like they would holdup with a little boy rolling around on them. I returned the cots to Target

I thought I would love this but just returned it.  It hurt my neck so badly after only wearing it a short time (10 minutes?)  Maybe I'm too small (5'2")or my baby (5 months and 18 pounds) is too large.  Either way I still find the Bjorn much more comfortable.  I would like something where the baby is more sideways on my hip like this than either facing me or facing out and so confined as he is in the Bjorn, but I couldn't stand wearing!  Very painful

Loved the car seat, until my Daughter was able to reach down and lift the velcro strap and release the harness portion of the straps.  I would hope that the manufacturer would address this and move the harness tightening straps under the seat.  That is my only complaint and it has indeed been a great car seat.

Loved our Marathon until our 18 month old reached down and pushed the release lever and leaned forward, loosening the straps and started trying to climb out of the seat. Since this happened he's figured out how to climb out with the harness still locked into place...just by loosening the harness.Although a highly rated seat I would think that this would be addressed by a company so proud of their high price tag product. I have seen several other same experiences on this site today and am appalled that nothing has been done to correct this.
Not very happy

I tried to put this oven "lock" on my oven. Unless you have lots of space between your cabinet and your oven unit you will have trouble even getting this thing to stick.

I finally fenagled it into place, sticking the first piece to the side of the oven, then applied the part that goes across the front and latched it in place.  Upon opening the oven door with very, very, very little force (I just barely cracked the door open) the latch teeth snapped open, as if the latch wasn't even there.  Tried several times, even sort of holding the teeth, and no luck.  In the trash it went.

I also tried another lock also from Safety first that seems like it would work great - it has a heavy duty hinge, but the half of the lock with the adhesive surface too short so that there is not enough length on the adhesive edge to adequately anchor it to your oven and still have the hinge lock in place - and the hinge locks in place at less than a 90 degree angle.  So this left the latch anchored with only about 1/4" of the adhesive strip on the oven.  Pop - off it came when I tried to open the door.  In the trash it went as well.

I'm very concerned about oven safety for my little guy and completely disappointed in the options out there for ovens.  :

The kneeling stool is great.  The padding is sufficient and I love that it flips over to convert to a stool...Very useful!   BUT...the elbow pad is a joke!  There is a hard plastic honey comb underneath it and hard plastic surrounding it that force you to put your elbows into two tiny areas or risk severe pain from the plastic.  Not to mention that to two measley suction cups that are suppose to hold it onto the side of the tub do not work at all.  It constantly pops off the tub whenever I put any weight on it.  I don't regret my purchase because of the stool which works really great. I suggest that if you still want this product after reading the reviews, you try to find it used so that you don't have to pay retail

Not only does this kneeler fall off of the tub whenever it wants, it is not high enough and very combersome to use. Its cheaper and more comfortable to fold a big fluffy towel next to the tub. HOWEVER, the step stool will be great when my son gets bigger

I inherited this product from my neightbor last week.  I have attempted to wash and clean it thoroughly before using it.  I cannot get the seat apart and it is incredibly dirty and moldy inbetween the seat and the swivel part.  Other reviewers have noted similar experiences but their seats broke when they tried to take it apart.  I would love to try this product, but as long as it is dirty and cannot be cleaned properly, it will not be used.  What a shame...baby products should be made so that they clean up easily

I had to return this item because it was too short for the side of my tub.  I would have to kneel on the knee pad to make it stretch and then sometimes the elbow pad would pop off.  I ended up trying it by just removing the stretch fabric and elbow pad, but then it became just an expensive knee stool.  The knee stool portion of this product was the only useful part to me and that is why I give it 2 stars rather than 1.  I returned it because you can get just the kneel stool from other companies for half the price

I recently purchased this product to ease my bach aches when bathing my 3 year old son.  It definetly relieved some of that uncomfortableness, however, the problem I encountered with this product is the top portion (elbow pad) adhering to the side of the tub.  It does not always suction properly and often times would fall off the edge of the tub.  The other day my son tried putting it back and suctioning it to the side of the tub.  There was a little moisture on the edge of the tub, the top slipped and he slammed his mouth onto the top of the tub.  He sustained a severly cut lip and jammed his top front teeth.  There was blood everywhere. His teeth are loose now but should be okay.  His lip is healing up but he was in pain for quite a while.  I would like other parents to be aware of this potential accident in hopes that their child will not be injured.

The image showing for this spoon set is not correct. The image is for Bendable Spoon which used to feed the baby before 12 month old and the description for the image is for baby after 12 month old. When you place the order they send you the set of spoon and fork with metal end for feeding the toddler not the plastic one for feeding the infant

Even though I think this is a very good idea (no mess to clean up like there is on a roaming stand-alone potty), the ring doesn't fit our toilet seats well. We have the oblong seats, not the round ones, and the ring slides back and forth, especially when my 2 yr old daughter tries to get up on it. It doesn't make her feel very stable so, so far at least, she has refused to use it

I ordered two of these training rings - one for when my daughter is at home and one for when she is at her grandparents during the week.  One arrived in perfect condition, the other was disappointingly split at the seams.  So I returned it and had another one shipped back to replace it.  I received it yesterday and was upset to find that it too was also split at the seams.  So I am returning it once again and asking for a refund, since I feel I will be better just going to the store to buy one that I can inspect before hand.  To be honest, the one that arrived in tact works just fine.  I guess it is just the luck of the draw depending on if you receive one that is in good condition or defective.  Good luck if you decide to order this

This toilet seat made it very discouraging for my son to start potty training since the splash gaurd left him with a rash on his inner thighs and lower tummy. The splash guard does not have a smooth finish and when it rubs against his skin, it can be quite painful. I plan on trying the baby bjorn seat, it looks like it would be more comfortabl

I was so excited to buy my son a potty seat.  He is two and has been using it since he was about 22 months.  He picked out the pooh and loved it and I love the splash guard.  Unfortunately, the seat tips when he leans over to pick up a book from a bucket on the floor.  He is not leaning over to the floor, the books are about 1 and a half feet from the floor.  This seat is quite tipsy

I was very disppointed in this product. I found it great that the containers would easily stack in the freezer, but this was the only good quality. I had to throw out all of my containers because they leaked and the plastic was obviously leaching. You could smell the plastic in the milk. I'm not going to expose my baby to extra chemicals, especially when her liver isn't developed enough to fully detoxify them.
I really wanted to love this product, but leaching plastic that leaks is not an acceptable option

I bought the Isis pump that came with these containers and also purchased a 10 pack of them at the same time. After using the ones that came with the pump a few times, i didn't like them. They are good in the fridge, but once you freeze them they tend to leak when thawing. I returned the unopened 10 pack and bought some of the 4oz bottles with storage caps instead. They were a little more expensive but well worth it. I love those and highly reccomend them. They also sell just the sealing disc, if you already have plenty of bottles

I wish I had put storage bags on my registry instead.  They work okay as a multipurpose container, but my freezer is full of these things. Moreover, I got the 8 oz ones, so they are only 1/2 full as my newborn only drinks 3-4 oz right now.  

One of the major pains about these is that you have to buy the lids and the containers seperately.  Plus, you need an adapter to fit the pump..something I didnt know I needed and didn't get.  Another waste of money from Avent.

I have used the Avent Isis pump for all three of my children and thought this product would be just as good and liked the fact that it works with the pump.  I was wrong.  Problems encountered include, it is very difficult to screw the caps on tight - they tend to leak, expensive - instructions recommend only using about 4 times and then discarding, measurements are hard to read, they do not hold a full 8 ozs, due to the shape narrow on the bottom and wide on the top they tend to tip over easily, and the adaptor for the pump is incovenient as I forgot to pack it more than once!  Save your money use bags or pump into the bottles directly if you are not freezing.

I didn't like these for a few reasons. They take up too much room in my freezer. They take too long to thaw. I don't care for the avent isis pump. I have been using the gerber freezer bags instead and I can freeze my milk flat and it thaws much quicker.

I am returning my Roxy safe seat!  It was like eye candy when i saw it online but then it shipped to my door....The material is not breathable and my baby is dripping with persperation when i take him anywhere in the seat.  At a grocery store, the seat JUST fits into the whole cart and I have no room for groceries.  Its not worth the hastle.  I admit it looks very nice but its like lugging around a herd of cattle its so heavy.  The seat belt itself is dangerously close to the babys neck and leaves red marks on his neck almost immediately after buckling him into place.  Sorry GRACO, the idea was good but the carseat is awfull

Graco might be making a killing with this product as they charge over $100 for something that appears to be made with less than $20 worth of materials. The seat is MUCH too big to fit in a regular compact car such as a 2006 Nissan Sentra unless you decide to install in a center seat location which has the advantage of being safer, but much more inconvenient. 

The documentation, in my opinion is very poor, and I've installed Linux systems from scratch w/ less documentation... Bad documentation could lead to unnecessary infant injuries and deaths if people don't completely understand the instructions.

Let's not talk about the styling... wasn't black, red and gray popular in the 80's or did I miss the come back somewhere...

I hope I can find something better... I'm giving this product TWO stars because it will do the job... but I expect much more from a product

This mirror really isn't worth the money.  You'd be better off just buying a plain mirror for baby to look in and for you to look at baby, that's about all this thing does.  The remote control has to be pointed directly at the mirror, kinda hard to do driving down the road.  Also, the music isn't very loud, atleast not loud enough to get baby's attention when upset, which is what I was hoping for.  And the lights aren't very bright.  Really can't see that they even light up unless it's very dark out.  Also, the positioner works fairly well when baby is facing backwards, but once you turn baby around and have to attach the mirror to the back of the front seat, it doesn't stay in place that well.  You could spend alot less money for just a plain baby -in-sight mirror

I was very disappointed in this mirror.  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I do use the mirror. I have a 2000 VW Passat with a headrest in the middle seat so I had no problem installing it. It's great to watch my little one while I drive. I do see the other reviewer's point about it being a safety issue because you kind of get obsessed with watching your baby and you should keep your eyes on the road. However, it never obstructed my view at all. 

I registered for this because of the remote control feature. Well, the remote control only turns the unit on and off and you have to keep the switch on the unit "on" (remote control access mode) in order for it to work.  There's a switch on the unit to play music OR turn the lights on and play music. You cannot control that feature from the remote control. You also cannot control the volume from the remote. It's really a pain.  I'm keeping it because I like the mirror but I'm not happy with it.  Save your money and buy the SafeFit Baby In Sight mirror.

I went to the CHP office to get my car seat checked, and the officer said that auto mirrors are not approved and considered a major safety hazard during an automobile crash because they can become a projectile, possibly injuring or killing your child. DO NOT BUY!

With the rear-facing infant seat in the recommended middle seat of our sedan, this mirror limits driver visability.  When the mirror is positioned so the driver can see the baby in the rearview mirror, a large section of the back windshield is blocked.  I'm glad we kept the box so we can exchange it for a different mirror

I bought this thinking it would be great, but have been VERY disappointed.  The suction cups don't stick very well (especially on wood)even if you wet them first.  My daughter is able pull it right off the table and dump the mess on the floor

I don't even know where to begin. Eeyore has a creepy voice that scared both of my kids. (1 1/2 and 6 months old) Instead of getting my daughter to crawl with him, she would cover her face and cry! He would go off all by himself, which was really creepy in the middle of the night. And he broke after a couple of months. Now his voice is distorted and we are going to yard sale him to get him out of the house. He's defantly not worth the mone
