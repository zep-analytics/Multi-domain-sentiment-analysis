I bought 3 sets of these blades for my cars. They lasted 2 weeks (at the most) on average in the summer. Bosch or Anco blades usually work for 2 years. It's up to you to decide which blades to buy!
Follow-up: I see some people find my review not helpful, you know what: I tried to warn you. Obviously You either have too much money or You're stockholders of RainX. My advice for You: buy garbage, support economy

I bought two pair in different sizes and one pair was great but the other pair had deteriorated edges that left water in lines from the first use and one lock didn't secure the blade to the arm well. I had to buy a replacement immediately

I had a pretty dirty car and I used the Mr. Clean Starter Kit. I followed all the directions.I also washed my car in the shade, and I rinsed and soaped the car in portions as one reviewer mentioned. I waited about 30mins or more for the car to dry and the only parts that were really clean and shiny were the windows. It still left a lot of dirt on my car, despite all the scrubbing I did during the soaping step. It even took more water than what I would have used washing it the old fashion way. I looked that the FAQ sheet that came with the kit and it said that if you see streaks it may be dirt, and all you have to do is go through the steps again to get rid of it. It's just a hassle. At least I can wash my house windows with it until the filter get's used up. Otherwise it's a waste of money

I bought this great piece of crap about a year ago.  When I first used it, I followed the directions as indicated on the box.  Worked fair the first time, I mean I could have just used my dads power washer but no, I am a pioneer and want to try new things.  So then I used it about 6 months later to detail a neighbors car and it left SCUM EVERYWHERE!  This wasn't your ordinary scum, this stuff was hard to get off the car.  I spent a solid day scrubing the car to get this SCUM off the car.  So I swore I wouldn't use it after all that happend.  So today I decided to wash my car because I'm moving to Arizona in a day.  I used the power washer with a new bottle of Mr. Clean soap. I mean hey...what would go wrong....MORE OF THAT SCUM, so here I am now spending my day rubbing the scum off at least the windows instead of packing up the car...anyway you all know my feelings on this product.  Mr. Clean makes quality products but screwed up somewhere with this one

I bought this product on a whim.  I was looking for carwash detergent at Safeway, and the Mr. Clean AutoDry was on sale.  Curious, I gave it a try.

First of all, this unit wastes a LOT of water.  After washing and rinsing, you have to apply filtered water all over the car from a distance of one feet.  It feels like spray painting.

Then you wait for the water to evaporate.  Problem is, I live in San Franisco, CA -- nothing dries in this climate without help.  If I hadn't hand dried my car, I'd still be waiting for the water to evaporate.

Another odd thing -- hand drying actually seemed more difficult after using the Mr. Clean soap and unit.  It's as though it left a residue.  I'm not sure what it is.

But I'll probably end up washing my car again tomorrow, the old-fashioned way ..

Ok It's so obviously obstructing the view of your license plate. I thought it would only blur it from the high distant angles of the cameras but it blurs it from almost every angle besides directly behind it (and even then the edges are blurry).  Check the laws in your local state. I'm pretty sure this thing is very illegal!!! I had to trash mine. Thanks for taking my money

I cannot believe they put this on the market.  Once it gets wet, there isn't much you can do about wringing it out.  It's title is true - it is a water magnet.  The problem is it just won't let the water go.  This towel is horrible.  I suggest using the 3-pack microfiber Meguiar's towels sold by Amazon as well under the subject "Meguiar's X2020 Supreme Shine Microfiber - Pack of 3"

Advertised as easy to install. Just hook up the existing horns wires and you have it......WRONG. If your existing relay is not compatible with the horn you get to purchase a new relay and rewire a whole new horn button somewhere on the vehicle. They also don't tell you it is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MOTORCYCLE RELAYS. If you get past all of this it does have a great sound

I own both the original unbreakable autolock (with the flat key) and the autolock pro (with the round key). The original autolock never failed to open after 10+ years of use on two cars. The autolock pro failed to open after about two years of light use. This is not a key problem, because I could not open it with two original keys. I eventually wiggled the lock a lot to open it. I recommend that you stick with the original autolock if you wish to use this kind of security device

This product was purchased as a Christmas gift for my father, unfortunately it did not perform for him. I was replacing this with one that he has had for over 10 years and that one still works and outperfomed this brand new model.
I am not sure if we just got a defective one but i dont recommend purchasing although i have to say returning to amazon was straightforward they just simply refunded my money, I will inturn buy my dad something else from amazon you just cant beat the service

Fatally flawed.  Magnificently compact, clever design, but broke first time I used it--el-cheapo plastic clamps snapped.  Service center wouldn't repair it, so I had to return it.  An otherwise beautiful design, with a frustrating Achilles heel.  AARRGH!

Had the Reese Sleeved lock on my Tow Hitch Step  for a year now &amp; damn if I can get the thing off !!!  We have tried Graphite (dry) Graphite Liquid
everything short of cutting the thing off. The key  (a flat one) won't BUDGE in the lock.  

Newer Reese towpower locks have round keys (like Vending machine keys) on them.  My cover has been on the lock ever since I bought it &amp; today it is 87 degrees outside. Still the lock won't allow the key to turn in it. after 10 minutes of working on it with the CTP keys it budged a little, but it still didn't unlock ALL the way. 

Tomorrow I am going to get my Custom Truck specialist to torch it off. Next time I will buy the MASTERLOCK  Brand.

I just received the gauge and I'm returning it after trying it for 2 minutes:

- The hose didn't seal well on the tire valve
- WHen bleeding air, the display didn't update. You have to remove the hose, wait 10 seconds for the display to turn off, then plug it back to the valve stem and get a reading. This is ridiculous.
- The display is on for 10 seconds and then it turns off itsel

If this gauge cost $20 I would give it a high rating, but even at the discounted $35 price I see for these gauges I think it is bad value, let alone the nearly $50 it cost me!

AS mentioned hose is VERY INFLEXIBLE at cool, not just cold temps, general quality of the fittings is very poor for something advertised like this, mine is now leaking badly and I am trying to repair with quality materials, as I still hope to use the gauge part anyway. 

I would NOT BUY AGAIN

It appears that the problem of slow readings described in the earlier reviews has been solved, as my gauge reads continuously.  The reading drops several psi while bleeding just as with a mechanical dial gauge.  The reading takes about two seconds to re-stabilize, so a mechanical gauge is actually faster to use.

The quick-connector on the end of the hose is excellent, but be careful to not scratch the wheel with it.  The hose is fairly stiff, but isn't a problem most of the time.

I used this gauge at the track this past weekend, and was pleased with it until the second morning when it was cold (by cold I mean 45F, this is Houston...) and the display read 'Lo', indicating a low battery.  So essentially the gauge was useless.  The hose also becomes annoyingly stiff when cold.

Overall, a good mechanical gauge is easier to use and more reliable, as long as you don't drop it

As other reviewers mentioned, the display does not update when using the bleed valve and you have to wait at least 10 seconds between readings.  It may be accurate, but dropping overpressure tires to a desired level ends up being a several-minute guessing and waiting game.  Calling it a "racing" gauge is ridiculous

I had the same problem described by R. Nielsen.  The gauge would not take a new reading after I pressed the release valve to let air out.  It only took a new reading if it was removed from the tire completely and reconnected.  I called the manufacturer, who told me that it sounded like a problem and that I should return the gauge to them for a replacement.  I returned it to Amazon as defective and got a new one with the same problem.  I contacted the manufacturer again and they again asked me to send the gauge in for a replacement.  I have sent the gauge to the manufacturer at my expense.  The second replacement also had the problem.  Customer service told me that they had sent the second replacement from the wrong batch/crate.

Six weeks later (November 27th) I received a properly functioning gauge.  So it seems that a properly manufactured example of this gauge really does work properly.  There was just a very large run of defective ones.  At this point, I would give this item 3 stars: 4 for performance and price, minus one for the hassle involved in getting one that isn't defective.

If yours is defective, you should contact Accutire customer service and let them know: 973-402-4240.

Dimensions are confusing/inaccurate.  Stated height of 11.5 inches is not correct--perhaps this is shipping container.  Actual product is about 8.5 inches high, but taking into account the cradle for tire, only raises the vehicle about 6 inches

I got this item for my coffee-loving truck driver husband.  When we took it out of the box, we saw the obvious problem:  the "mug" is tiny!  Only a bit larger than an espresso cup.  To add insult to injury, it took way too long to brew for such a small cup.  Now it's back in the box collecting dust and we're sorry we wasted our hard-earned money

This bag was junk on a 2001 4Runner.  The poor fit made it hard to secure and even more difficult to load and unload.  I realize it isn't made for all vehicles but I purchased mine only after speaking with Lund, who confirmed the bag would work on my vehicle.  Spend the extra money and buy a hard shell unit with adjustable hardware.  Great service from Amazon, terrible service from Lund

I had a previous non-brand name digital tire gauge and it worked great but eventually died. I bought this one thinking it would be better. The first time I used it I couldn't get a good connection at all and it kept giving me multiple readings.  It also does not seem to keep the number on the display after the reading. It would disappear before i could read it fully.

I have had 2 faulty units right out of the box. The first would not hold a charge for more than a couple of days and that did not improve after cycling the battery a number of times. I returned it for a replacement and that 2nd unit never indicated a full charge - even after being on charge for several days. I am moving on to another brand.

Don't waste your time and money on these poor quality items

i wouldn't recommend this product.  The positive terminal clamp broke in half the first time i used it... I, as I was stranded, rigged up a method to make contact with the terminal w/ the remaining half of the clamp.  Then the charger (which was charged fully the previous night) didn't provide enough power to actually turn the engine over.  I will be returning to the store tonight, returning this item, and purchasing a different charger

It's a pain because to save time you need to install it permanently to make it worth it.  Then you can never use that window for anything else. It's a pain because it will NOT work on tinted windows.

Don't waste your money. That's the short version. No stars for this P.O.S. Want more? OK - once you've fiddled around and fitted the rubber strips to your window, hooked on the device, rolled up your window (facing the sun, of course) you're now late for whatever it was you just parked to go do. Oh yes, and it doesn't do anything other than spin a joke fan that couldn't move a feather. I put my hand in front of it and felt nothing - no wonder my car still feels like an oven. We can't drive off with it on, as the wind noise is unbearable even after unhooking the unit. Why? Because of the 'sealing' rubber strip you've hooked over the top of the glass leaving a nice 4mm gap for the wind.
I thought I was smart going on ebay and buying two for the price of one. I would have been smarter spending the money on lottery tickets

I purchaced this product because its a great idea.  The problem is it only runs when the sun is shining on the solar panel. Also there is not enough suction to get the hot air out. Also the product does not sit on the window firmly and can fall off if you open your window.

Hopefully they can take this design an improve the suction and maybe add a battery. Similar to the solar lights you put in your driveway

I also purchased this product &amp; was extremely disappointed when I found out it did NOT work.  Like the 1st reviewer wrote, it basically is a mini-fan that moves BUT it does NOT cool the car down at all!  There was absolutely NO difference in the temperature of my car after I installed it!  DON'T waste your money

To turn off your check engine light on most vehicles, with your vehicle turned off, pull out and hold your trip odometer reset stick and then start your vehicle. In most cases the light will shut off. If there is truly a problem with you car, the light will either not stay off or come right back on. You do not need this device to do that. The second problem is if your car does need attention, this device won't really properly diagnose or certainly won't fix it and you'll still have to go to a mechanic. So I'm left wondering what good this is

Maybe it depends on the car, but I couldn't get it tight enough in my SUV to prevent the dogs from knocking it down.  It also probably depends on the dog.  If the dog really wants to get past it, they will.  If you have a more mellow dog who will be satisfied with a "psychological barrier", this would be ok.  Oh, and as a previous reviewer mentioned, the "trombone" style sides slide easily back and forth, I had to get some hose clamps to keep them in place

This is THE worst smelling "freshener" I have ever used. Its just a terrible smell. Like the other reviewer said, its very chemical in nature. I sprayed som in my living room to see what it was like and.....WOW. I opened the windoes pretty quick, I could not imagine this in a hot car. I picked it up for 1.50 at a BigLots and I feel ripped off.

Dont buy it

If you've seen the movie "Cars" and figure that it's time that you gave your rusty bucket the "Radiator Springs" make-over special, you might just be tempted to get yourself a batch of this stuff to make it smell as good as it looks.

Sure - it says "New Car Scent", and it has a picture of a car and a nice ribbon and everything - but I would definitely not use this stuff in my car.  First of all, it doesn't smell anything like the interior of a new car, and inhaling this stuff in that small an area would be lethal, even if you drive a Hummer.  It is super-concentrated, and a one second blast is enough to saturate a 10 ft x 10 ft room with an unpleasant chemical smell, which might just be able to eliminate you and yours along with the airborne bacteria, smoke and odors.
 
I can't vouch for any of the claims of air cleansing, sanitizing, bacteria reduction or removal of smoke and odors, because after the first test spray (in my office on a Friday afternoon) I vacated the premises under duress, and by Monday morning it had thankfully dissipated.  I've never used it again, and even though it may conceivably be the best airborne germ killing thing-gummy ever invented, the smell makes it impossible to use in the presence of living, breathing people.
 
To be fair, the write-up never actually states that it is for cars, instead listing schools, medical facilities and food-processing areas, but then why on earth would you want any of these places to smell like a new car?  And why would you need a one ounce bottle of product for your factory?  The claims of deodorizing and leaving a fresh fragrance certainly didn't happen for me, and unless you come from somewhere where the pollution smells worse than this, I couldn't recommend it.

I bought this cushion hoping it would make sitting at my computer for long hours more pleasant. Unfortunately after about half an hour, the "memory foam" gets totally squished down and it's almost useless. Don't try to save money by getting this cheap one - spend the extra money and get one that doesn't suck.

I bought the "Wagan 9788 Ortho Cushion" and it does not meet the deminsions at all. The total lenght was to be 19". It's 16 1/2". ETC"

How can Wagan screw up something like that, or did they?  Making something to short by accident and lying to the people until it's fixed.

I had been wanting this for 2 years due to having a cracked tail bone several times in my life. When I saw it at this price I bought it right away. I'm here to tell you not to waste your money! I only weigh 100 pounds which is small for an adult and when I sat on this hoping it would keep my tail bone lifted the pillow completely smashed down flat with no support what so ever. It was a BIG disappointment

I was so excited about this bag but it was a huge disappointment.  The description clearly indicates WATERPROOF, but in fact it is mostly water RESISTANT, an 8 on a scale of 1-10 according to the box.  and since our travel coincided with several rain storms, this was a very important differentiation!
the straps for the 'net' are extremely unmanageable and there are several key elements missing from the instructions.  having never used a roof top cargo bag before, this presented quite an obstacle for me.  there are loops through which you send the straps for the net that holds the bag down, the instructions make no mention of them, do you loop the strap through before or after you loop it through the luggage rack?  does it make a difference?  it took me 45 minutes just to get the thing attached to my roof due to trial and error (not counting loading time).
the clips themselves are very poor construction, one of them broke upon tightening and had to be makeshift tied instead.
the straps also do not tighten very easily, you have to feed the straps through the clips and then keep moving the clips back and forth until you get it to the length you want.
the stitching also started ripping when trying to close the very stubborn zipper.  the bag was not overstuffed.
I cannot recommend this product

I purchased this for my 2001 VW golf, and it did not work. I know some of the other vehicles wire directly in, but you have to put a spare key in the unit and wrap it around the ignition. It made the install seem very half-a**ed. I could have just taped the key to the ignition at that point. I will get the immobilizer delete software instead of this junk. Thumbs down from me on at least VW and Audi application

March 14 FOLLOW UP REPORT: Pump found to stall and stop at 40 pounds pressure. Teresa K. Naeole of Q. Industries by phone said I could return pump and would be sent a more expensive tire pump in return. Returned pump was received at 159 Islington on February 16 at 12:55 pm. I have not received a new pump. I cannot get a response from telephone message requests at (303) 629 7700. Almost a month now. Yuk! Paul

I purchased the HV30 Portable Compressor because it promised rapid inflation of tires and blowup toys. The 140 pound pressure limit was certainly adequate. The price was right.

The Compressor comes with a hose that screws onto the compressor on one end and screws onto the tire valve stem on the other end. The compressor end thread was damaged. I had to use a pliers to tighten what should have been a hand tightened connection. Because the tire end screws on, air is lost as it is unscrewed after the tire is inflated. Most tire inflators come with a quick disconnect. Further, the compressor won't start against tire pressure if the connector hose is screwed on the tire valve. I had to start the compressor and then screw the hose onto the valve stem.

I haven't tried inflating a bike tire yet. I strongly suspect the air lost during unscrewing the connector hose will almost deflate the tire. This is just a great idea for inflating tires much faster than with pumps designed for much higher pressure limits but really poor engineering execution

Sticking the solar module on the side of the garage door opener like they instruct doesn't work--the solar panel has to be right next to the lightbulb to get enough power to work.  I was able to mount it close enough to the lightbulb and make a small cutout in the cover to get it to fit--you might not be able to depending on your garage door opener.  Also the bracket that holds the laser module has too light a hold on the module, it doesn't hold it in rotational position

My husband purchased this charger for me for Christmas, after lots of mornings when my van wouldn't start and he was already gone to work.  Except for having to search far and wide for the right kind of extention cord to plug this thing in, we were excited to have something for those "just in case" moments.  We plugged it in and have left it in since then.  Just this week our battery was dead again.  We excitedly went to use this charger, and lo and behold, it wouldn't work.  We had to call a neighbor to come and give us a jump start.  Later that day the battery was dead again (!!!) and this charger worked that time, so who knows what happened?

We haven't tried the outlet power, so I have no idea how reliable that is.

I won't count on this machine.  Luckily I have a small battery charger that I can plug my car into, and after twenty minutes or so I'm ready to go.  I won't be getting rid of that charger--it's much more dependable

Appears to be a good product with one major exception. You can't even charge it for first use without getting an extension cord to plug into 110v power. Required cord must have only one plug in where as most cords today come with a plug on the end that will let you plug in more than one item. The blades on the jump starter are resessed so the extension cord must have only one place to plug anything or the fitting is to big to go into the recess. Got this as a present and so far the report is that an old type cord is hard to find. 
I find it unbelievable that any company producing this item would not include 4 feet of cheap cord so the product could be put in service at once

I purchased the set of two Park Smart parking mats as a simple alternative to hanging a tennis ball on a string which would hit the windshield when my car was sufficiently inside the garage to close the door. But even with stickum on the bottom the mats slipped on the smooth floor of the garage and the car hit the workbench time and again. I may say the service I got through amazon.com was first rate; it's the product I found wanting

We bought this scratch remover years ago from an auto store. It wasn't that expensive but totally useless. We put it on a scratch or two on our car which is black and did what it said. It did nothing except leave a white stain on the area I applied it to. I tried everything to get it off, then I had to use my last option rubbing compound. 

Luckily the rubbing compound got the stain off. After this I dumped the tube in our basement and lost track of it since then (Probably dumped it). Shortly after we went to the auto store again and we found auto paint. They come in a little tube with a paint brush and each paint has a code (got to get the one for your model car). Used it worked well and years later still looks good.

 Up close you can still see a scratch was there but only really up close. After that I waxed the area after the paint dried and it looked fine. Unless you look for it you will not see a scratch. So don't buy this product either buy the auto paint or take your car to an auto body shop. This product would be better as a door stop and even then it would probably do a poor job.

I was unsure about this company so I only popped for a week subscription, felt the gamble of $10 was worth it.  Well not all gambles work out, this one did not.  When you 1st register you tell them what vehicle you have, now one might think once you do this that the information you want to access will be about your particular vehicle, not so.  I want to know how to replace a certain part, well you go to that part look it up, it tells you the replacement procedure for a car not even yours, and nothing about your car, uh!! C'mon. 

There's very little trobleshooting, no flow charts for troubleshooting.
Save you money and buy a Haynes Manual for your vehicle, you'll be much farther ahead.

This car seat cushion's foam padding is not only paper thin, but it also has what feels like circular metal inserts (I'm not kidding) placed in some of the cushion's "massaging bubbles".  This makes for an unbelievably uncomfortable car seat, as these internal metalic objects dig right into your back and spine!  I threw my "Massage Cushion" into the trash after about twenty minutes with this thing

We purchased this rooftop cargo carrier to transport our suitcases and beach items during our summer vacation to New England.  We were initially concerned because it was so inexpensive for the size and worried that it might not fit a Trailblazer.  Upon arrival we were pleased to find that it not only fit securely, but was rather stylish too.  Although it appeared weatherproof we soon found that it was not.  It began raining at the onset of our trip.  About four hours in to our fourteen hour roadtrip the weatherproof lining began disintingrating.  By the time we arrived at our destination all our possessions were soaked and coated in tiny grey vinyl flecks.  This cargo hauler might be cheap and look nice, but it is not worth your money

One day when it was 100 degrees outside, I used it in my car, rolled all of the windows up and went into a store to shop.  When I came out and got into my car, it was hotter than I could have ever imagined.  It hadn't cooled my car prior to that either.  It looked like a very small fan blowing, and that was it.  I came home, took it off, and threw it out.  I was not satisfied at all

This includes a big piece of gooey tape to seal the window of your car when using this item--who's actually going to put this on their car? It makes the whole product useless and basically something to throw away. Check the picture--see anything messy you have to stick onto your car? Misleading and a waste of money. Don't buy it

A tire pressure gauge only has to do one thing well. That is to accurately measure the air pressure inside the tire. My Accugage was reading 5 PSI high when tested alongside a calibrated pressure transducer. That's why I give it only one star

I had this alarm professionally installed by PepBoys (which is DesignTech's recommended professional installer). After the initial installation with all the wiring was done, PepBoys found out that the brain was defective. They confirmed this as well with several tests that they did. After being on the phone with DesignTech's horrible customer service, and several faxes later, they sent me a new brain, and I just mailed out the defective old brain with a prepaid mailing label that they provided. After my 2nd visit with PepBoys, it was the same problem. And yes, DesignTech sent me a defective replacement. Several more calls and faxes later, I got the 3rd one, and that one turned out ok.

The features worked fine, and the batteries lasted me a long time. But the fob themselves are made up of really cheap looking plastic (even the silver one). Other than that, it worked fine. I got a new truck, and this time I've invested in an AudioVox system (sold under the Pursuit brand) and I love that everything is so integrated and easier to upgrade. I still had a professional install it and I've never had any problems with it.

The Design Tech Deluxe Remote Car Starter comes with excellent features and a compact remote.  The problem is, the item I received did not work.

All wires were hooked up appropriately and double check with a test kit.  Once hooked up, there was no response from the unit.  After hours of attempting to troubleshoot, I looked online at Design Tech's website for local authorized installers in the hopes that they might be able to answer my question.

Unfortunately the three "authorized" installers in my area REFUSED to touch Design Tech's equipment because, and I quote "they're too difficult to work with.  We haven't had much success."  

A little alarmed by this response, I attempted to contact the company using their 800 number during their live tech support hours.  After waiting 1/2 on hold with no approximate wait time and no end in sight, I hung up and decided instead to return the defective unit back

This item performed as expected, reads and resets fault codes in all vehicles with OBD-II connector. Easy to use - only 2 buttons! You might be able to find it $10 cheaper at a local store on sale, but even at the price I paid it was a BARGAIN! Cost of tool = 1 diagnostic visit to local shop

The product would not put out enough current to help with the drain on my battery. I think I purchaced too small of a unit for my needs.  May work well with a smaller type of battery, not on a car battery

I put the Sunforce 50012 inside my car's windscreen and plugged it into the cigar lighter.  (On this car the cigar lighter is "live" even when the ignition is off).  The Sunforce 50012 worked for one day.  Next day it appeared dead (There is blue LED that blinks when it is working).  I picked it up, it started working, sat it down, it quite.  Twisted it, it worked, then it didn't, then it did.  The old intermitant (sp) connection problem.  Basically it was shot, dead, kaput, trash it.  Long story short, I fixed it by taking it apart and re-soldering components.  I am smart and lucky with nothing better to do.  99.999% of the users could not make this fix.  So just forget about it.  This thing is garbage

It took 20 mins to fill a car tire from 20psi to 30psi.  Truck Air? -- It could barely fill a car tire.  It would take over 3 hours for it to reach 300psi if it even could make it.  STAY CLEAR.

We received this as a employee gift and were so excited to have it.  Not only does it not fill anything pass 15 PSI, the 12V cord is very cheaply made where it plugs into your cig. lighter.  The plastic on the tip started to crack after pulling it out.  With the few more times we used it, I the tip completely broke.  At least it comes with 7 year warranty.  Save yourself the disapointment and headache

We live in a city and we got a minor ding on the side of the car. We bought this kit a few years ago somewhere other than Amazon (think a auto store). Anyway we did what it said and did it several times. It did take some of the ding out but not all of it. We barely got the glue off from it. A few years later we got hit by a suv when we were getting the car fixed we had the guy remove the ding and now it looks perfect. Sadly this thing was not worth the money or effort we put into it. I also watched Fox 5 and they tested the item it didn't work for them either. I know it will cost more but take it to a auto shop and get the ding removed there. Don't buy this product it is worthless.

The second time I shook the bottle - seven days later it still hasn't dried enough to buff off.  I'm not sure if its the product or whether Amazon are selling an inferior conterfeit

I work in an auto shop and this thing is a joke.... with the money that you pay for a filter and 5+ qts. of oil, you can get it done by a professional that will buy you a new engine if it blows up. Will this company stand by its product like that? I doubt it... For a few extra bucks you can get an oil flush if you're worried about gunk... It's a scam..

The oil must be removed through the oil drain to properly evacuate the contaminated oil from the crank case. And the oil filter must be replaced to prevent contamination of the new oil. 

Maybe you'll find this product wonderful and a cost-effective alternative, what do you do with the oil syphoned from the engine? A small but important cost of the oil change at a garage is for disposal of the oil.

gimmick.
There are a number of rerouting oil change kits available. Why subject your engine to serious damage and loss of oil with the addition of rubber hoses and hose clamps that may crack or fail? The oil filter seals itself very well on most engines. While it can be a nuissance to remove on some vehicles, I wouldn't risk hose failure for a little convenience. On my Toyota truck I discovered reaching through the engine from the hood is the fastest way to get to the filter. I'm not sure that many people even change their own oil. It's cheaper to take it to the Toyota dealer, 29.95 and they even rotate the tires.

Sediment and metal particles settle in the bottom of your drain pan and these kits can't siphon all that out.  Most "quickie-lube" stations that pioneered this process have abandoned it because they were getting sued for damaging the engine.  

The right way to change your oil is to run your engine until hot and and drain from the bottom; that does a much better job of removing the sludge

I purchased two of these, both coffee makers arrived without an instruction manual, not that you really need one.   The outside of the box says have coffee in a few minutes, I guess it depends who defines a few minutes.   Both makers took 20 minutes to heat just one cup of water.  To make a pot, that would be 100 minutes.   I am returning as I am definitely disappointed

I own a black '02 Jetta TDI and am anal about maintenance, including the exterior. I'm always looking for the one wax product that best suits a black car, and have found some that work well. The NXT Gen Tech Wax isn't one of them. One requirement for me is a wax that doesn't leave a white residue to clean up and detail out. The NXT box clearly states that it leaves no white residue, but I'll attest to the fact that it certainly does. In that respect, it's no better than any other wax that leaves a residue. But the worst is the film it left on my car's finish. I waxed my car with NXT, then went on a 150 mi trip to visit relatives. I went in and spent some time with them, then we decided to go eat and take my car. The sun was shining, and as soon as I walked outside and looked at my car, I could immediately see a haze on the hood, top, and trunk lid. I did plenty of polishing after waxing, so it shouldn't have done that. I borrowed a towel and wiped it off, but it returned. When I got back home, I used alchol to remove the NXT, returned the NXT to the store, got some Eagle One Nanowax, rewaxed, and it's gorgeous....with no haze or swirl marks and absolutely no white residue. Good riddance to NXT

This piece of equipment worked really well as far as juicing up the battery when it's dead, and it's really easy to charge and use. Problem is, after I had used it a couple times, the cheapo plastic clamps BOTH SNAPPED. Now they can't grip on the battery terminals. Under warranty, but so expensive to ship (shipping not covered by warranty) that it isn't worth it. Great idea, shoddy construction. ALL VECTOR have these same plastic clamps, so try to find one with metal clamps.

This is the second Accu-Gauge tire pressure gauge I have purchased.  The first had very good accuracy and lasted about 3 years.  This one, when compared to three other digital gauges, always shows about 3-4 lbs. less pressure.

This product preys on the paranoia created by sensationalist newscasts and talk shows.  TV convinces you there's a real chance you might find yourself underwater in your car, and now whoever manufactures this makes a killing.  I'll put it in a drawer with my SARS facemask, my whole life insurance policy, and that replacement plan Best Buy just tried to sell me on a twenty-dollar pair of headphones.  I'm sure this thing works as advertised, and I'm just as sure you'll never need to find out.

Having read reviews that the fluorescent bulb was dim, I was careful to purchase the LED model.  However, it is also dim.  Barely produces enough light to keep me from tripping in my shed, not enough to distinguish tools and definitely not a work light.  Very disappointing.  After several days of charging I turned it on and only 4 of the 5 LEDs lit.  I did not purchase from Amazon.  Went in round and round discussions with retailer and manufacturer about warranty replacement.  Retailer would only replace if whole unit returned within 30 days, but after all the trouble to mount solar panel on roof I didn't want to take that down.  Turns out there is no warranty.  Product guide says to consult retailer for warranty service, retailer says they don't do it.  Finally got a replacement but was not refunded shipping and insurance.  If you do purchase this product, my advice is to charge it up before mounting anything to test it

after carefully mounting the solar panel outside my shed, in plain view of the sun, the shed light worked twice and has never lit up again. After the effort I put in carefully mounting the unit I'm very disappointed and don't feel like rolling the dice and seeing if the replacement will work.

Forget using this in a shed as the light is hardly bright enough to see your hand in front of your face.  

It doesn't hold a charge for longer than a few hours (the unit I received stayed on for about one hour and the box stated three hours).  This information was no where to be found on the website.

I purchased this item to use in my chicken coop and had anticipated that I would be able to leave it turned on at all times.  My plan was that it would recharge during the day and stay illuminated during the night.  Not possible with this unit as it can't charge the battery at all if it's left turned on.  In addition the unit I received had been previously used and returned by someone else (obvious from the packaging that it had been used before)... so I'm not the only one who thought this was worthless.

Save your money and try a different product

I was looking for something like this for months.  It was a new product on Amazon when I did a Froogle search.  Installed immediately the batteries charged right up and when I turned on the light I was disappointed.  My 8x10 shed was dimly lit, lots of shadows, certainly not enough to work by. Not much more light than what my lawn lights put out.  During the past two months I've used the light 4 or 5 times for a few minutes each time.  After being used no more than an hour over a two month period the bulb died.  I haven't even begun to look for a new one.  Very disappointe

When the factory-charged batteries ran out the solar panel would not charge the light.  This was a fluorescent version.  The replacement unit- quickly sent by Amazon -was LED.  The same case and everything but with bright LEDs inside.  I liked it much better than the fluorescent one.    
The second unit charged and worked very well until the charge was depleted.  Then the LEDs would start blinking.  Like an emergency light.  Sunforce said that this was not normal behavior.  I returned it as well.  The light will stay up for around two hours, charge quickly but the blinking made it unfit for continuous use.  A nice product but quallity needs to be improved

I received these seat covers as a birthday gift and one of them did rip at the seam (also shortly after they were installed). I came on here to order another and after reading that someone else had the same problem I know not to waste my money. They are very unique and I do like the looks of them but only wish they were better quality

We were expecting MORE of a cushion-feel to this seat, but all its really made of is a mesh fabric with little wires inside it to keep air flow moving.  It would be okay to keep your butt cool maybe, but for a cushion, its flat and cheap feeling.  As for "king size" it barely covers our car's seat...we ended up returning them...not worth it..

This product works great for draining your car's crankcase oil. It has a screen to catch the drain plug. HOWEVER, the large diameter plastic lid that seals the unit after draining is a PIECE OF CRAP. You are supposed to tighten it down, then open the small plug to drain the oil into another container for disposal. The large lid has a single thread that if you turn a half-inch too far makes no seal at all. It falls off when you tip the unit to drain, emptying two to three quarts of used oil on to your garage floor. This is a product that needs a bit more engineering to work well

This product is absolutely worthless, especially in the hot Texas summer.  The pitifully weak fan does not cool the car one bit.  It is still blazing hot when you get inside.  Don't waste your money on this over-hyped piece of garbage.  Better to leave your windows down or park under a tree

I suggest that you do a search on this product on infomercial scams dot com.

Take a look at this review from Channel 2 (KDKA) in Pittsburgh, PA:

You've probably seen the ad on TV for auto cool - it's supposed to keep your parked car cooler.

But does it really do that? 

Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to keep your parked car cool?

Diane Black knows all too well the misery of climbing into a hot car. 

"I am a visiting nurse. I'm in and out of the car all day," Black said. "I hate using the air conditioning because it uses up all my gas. So I thought this little gadget for $14.99 would be the perfect thing."

After shipping and handling, $23 for Auto Cool as seen on TV. 

The same sun that makes your car unbearably hot will keep it cool and comfortable thanks to a solar powered fan that blows the hot air out of your parked car. 

But does it really do that?

On a hot day last week, we decided to find out. Inside the Auto Cool box, we get our solar powered fan and some weather stripping.

The only thing you need is a pair of scissors.

Now they tell you to check either the front or back window - whichever is getting the most sun.

We choose the back window and we're going to put the window down four or five inches.

The solar powered fan starts working the second the sun's rays hit it. No problem there. We hang it on the window, fan side in.

Next comes the weather stripping.

So we've installed Auto Cool. Now we are going to go inside, wait about an hour and check it and see if it's any less than 110 degrees.

While we are away, the thermometer slowly moves - in the wrong direction.

One hour later, it's 118 degrees inside that car.

We are stunned that auto cool didn't work at all. It just got hotter inside. 

But just to be fair, we test one more car.

We make sure to start off the car is relatively cool. This time, it's 80 degrees.

We quickly install auto cool. By now, the temperature is 90 degrees. 

While Diane is off doing hers, a patient visits. She says it will take about 20 minutes. 

In the meantime, that solar powered fan is working we can even feel the hot air blowing out of the car.

Will it work this time? 

Twenty minutes later - it's 110 degrees.

Maybe if we hadn't used Auto Cool, our car would have been 111 degrees instead of 110, but that high up, we don't care. 

Not only does it not do that, this is the worst product we've tested so far.

Don't waste your money on this one.

If you, like myself, live in world where there is "weather", then you'll understand why I hate this product.  You see, there are times when the temperature of my car, and everything in it, becomes amazingly cold.  We call it "winter".  You've never heard of it, you say? Well, apparently neither have the people who dreamed up this stuff.  I've had a can of this in my car for over a year now.  Went out to my car one FREEZING morning (it gets like that during the "winter" I mentioned before), and saw I had a flat!  "No problem" thinks I, "I do believe I have been carrying a solution to this very problem right here in the trunk!".  Open the trunk, pull out the "Fix a Flat" (HA!) only to find it FROZEN SOLID.  Now, what use does something like this have, whereby you keep it in your car for an emergency only to have it completely useless when you need it most!?  Cost me time + $ to put on my spare, haul it to a shop, and have my tire repaired.  This stuff was a waste of money. If you live somewhere where there's actual WEATHER, don't kid yourself with this nonsense

this product does work, BUT it has to face the sun, so if you put it in the window that faces east it will work in the morning, not in the afternoon, it needs to be put in a window that faces southwest to work the way they claim in the TV ad.
Also they are hard to place with powered windows

This device is nothing but a high priced gimmick that looks good in advertising, but does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IT SAYS IT DOES.  The unit is hard to install, for beginners. It is too much to mess with every time you get out of your car in hot weather. If there is low sunlight, or you have the least amount of tinting on your windows, even factory shading, IT DOES NOT WORK. You must point it directly to the sun in order for it to activate the venting fan in it, and how many times is your car tipped and pointed so the unit will look directly at the sun??

This product does not cool down the car.  It is too small.  I would not use this on an expensive car because the weatherstrips that you need to install the product can be easily cut with a razor blade allowing for easy access to your car locks.  If you buy this, PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE YOUR PETS OR KIDS IN THE CAR and think that it is safe

This thing does not install in seconds as suggested,it comes with goofy plastic pieces that you're supposed to put in the window with it. Who want's to fool with that everytime? It also says to not use with tinted windows, something that could have been mentioned here

Installation of these blades is not straightforward--three adapter pieces and a pin are included, which might work well enough, but the instructions provided with the product could not be more of a joke. I'll be returning to the store and asking one of their employees (at Kragen) to install all three blades (they're nice enough there, if you're willing to wait). In the future, I won't be buying this product when I need new blades. I don't mind a bit of complication in installing stuff like this, but the instructions should be adequate to the task, and they're really not
