I want to start by saying Fred Flare- shipped this product very fast!! And the transaction itself was very smooth. I do however, have extreme problems with the product itself. The product is not leather, its nylon, and it sort of looks cheap? The inside material is sued, but that's only the lining for the base of the wallet. Also, The wallet part is very hard to use. You cant really put too much in the wallet- The credit card slots are a little too snug, and there is no place for my I.D. The wallet included a small "note book" but it also doesn't fit in the wallet? I was very excited about this product, but now I feel duped. The pictures made the wallet seem like it was of higher quality, and that it was user friendly, but it's not. I do not recommend this product

I have to say that I was disappointed when I opened up the package containing my iPod wallet. It's cute, but not $60ish cute. First of all, it's not leather, it's nylon. The lining is indeed suede, but the photos in the product listing are misleading. I'm keeping it because the hassle of shipping it back, etc. isn't worth it. It does the job, but it wasn't what I was expecting. I feel ripped off

Perhaps it is my own fault for not reading more closely, or failing to question the somewhat ambiguous product description.  The fact is, I thought that I would be receiving 84 plastic stays (3x28), 28 each in 3 different sizes.  At $8.00, that seemed like a reasonable deal for plastic collar stays.  What I got, and I confess that the product description could be interpreted this way, was a total of 28 stays in assorted sizes.  When you add in the $4.00 I was charged for shipping (actual US Postal Service postage on the package was $1.84), this really is a poor deal compared to other available options.  About 43 cents for each plastic collar stay?  A bad choice

I have had plenty of pairs of Doc's but these are not the best for me........... they are not comfy and they tend to be a little tough to break in. As soon as I put them on and took ONE STEP ---- there right across the top of the shoe is a nice big crease......... It does not look nice and I am "ticked" about that...........plus I didnt expect the laces to have green and maroon colors mixed into the brown laces...... it looks dorky!

Plus I have a manufacturing flaw in them.  Inside the heel the seam isnt quite right and it rubs my skin and hurts like heck! 

Hopefully the next model I get isnt like thses or they are going back....... Putting up with these for now.......

These body suits are awful! When I first saw them I was really relieved that I had found something that would be good for the summer months. I put them on my twins after a first wash and the velcro closure scraped up the insides of their delicate little legs! The suits were the appropriate size and were washed according to the label. I am so disappointed and angry. It was a waste of my money.

I give the order processing an A+ due to receiving the product within three days.

The bag, on the other had, leaves a bit to be desired.  While the material used is soft, the inexpensive zippers are difficult to operate with one hand

The shirt fits well, good style, good shirt.  But Bealls of Florida sucks as a retailer.  Their customer service is rude, crude, and unrefined.  Even the supervisors of Customer Service suck, they don't return or accept any items back.  So BEWARE, you better be damn sure that size fits (ordered product before).  Because Bealls of Florida will not let you return the item for different size or style.  I will not shop here again!  I repeat, I WILL NOT SHOP HERE AGAIN.  THIS PLACE SUCKS AS FAR AS A RETAILER

If you are a small frame person or a short person these will work fine for you. The white is thin and you can see through it so i don't reccomend buying white on this brand. The t-shirts run very small. A size x-large fits both of us very big on most brands but this brand was so tight we could not even get it on so these run very small. They are also short. 29 inches is short for a man's t-shirt. If you are tall, i would not recommend this t-shirt. 

The t-shirt is soft, not scratchy and the style is nice. We only had problems with the sizing and of course the white being so thin that it is see through

I have to say that I was disappointed when I opened up the package containing my iPod wallet. It's cute, but not $60ish cute. First of all, it's not leather, it's nylon. The lining is indeed suede, but the photos in the product listing are misleading. I'm keeping it because the hassle of shipping it back, etc. isn't worth it. It does the job, but it wasn't what I was expecting. I feel ripped off

I have had plenty of pairs of Doc's but these are not the best for me........... they are not comfy and they tend to be a little tough to break in. As soon as I put them on and took ONE STEP ---- there right across the top of the shoe is a nice big crease......... It does not look nice and I am "ticked" about that...........plus I didnt expect the laces to have green and maroon colors mixed into the brown laces...... it looks dorky!

Plus I have a manufacturing flaw in them.  Inside the heel the seam isnt quite right and it rubs my skin and hurts like heck! 

Hopefully the next model I get isnt like thses or they are going back....... Putting up with these for now.......

These body suits are awful! When I first saw them I was really relieved that I had found something that would be good for the summer months. I put them on my twins after a first wash and the velcro closure scraped up the insides of their delicate little legs! The suits were the appropriate size and were washed according to the label. I am so disappointed and angry. It was a waste of my money.

Perhaps it is my own fault for not reading more closely, or failing to question the somewhat ambiguous product description.  The fact is, I thought that I would be receiving 84 plastic stays (3x28), 28 each in 3 different sizes.  At $8.00, that seemed like a reasonable deal for plastic collar stays.  What I got, and I confess that the product description could be interpreted this way, was a total of 28 stays in assorted sizes.  When you add in the $4.00 I was charged for shipping (actual US Postal Service postage on the package was $1.84), this really is a poor deal compared to other available options.  About 43 cents for each plastic collar stay?  A bad choice

The shirt fits well, good style, good shirt.  But Bealls of Florida sucks as a retailer.  Their customer service is rude, crude, and unrefined.  Even the supervisors of Customer Service suck, they don't return or accept any items back.  So BEWARE, you better be damn sure that size fits (ordered product before).  Because Bealls of Florida will not let you return the item for different size or style.  I will not shop here again!  I repeat, I WILL NOT SHOP HERE AGAIN.  THIS PLACE SUCKS AS FAR AS A RETAILER

I received an email from txshirts stated that I should direct all inquiries to csr@txshirts.com. I did this on two occasions and received no reply. Customer service finally contacted me only to ask why I had left negative feedback on Amazon. They stated they never received any email from me.

Their gym shorts were not as described. The description said "covered elastic waistband". Instead, I received an "uncovered" elastic waistband that digs into my skin and leaves indentations on my skin. 

Their response? I should pay for return shipping in order to get my money back.

But who should pay for return shipping when an item is falsely advertised??

I purchased these about 3 months ago.  They have very little arch support and very little other support elsewhere.  I have been wearing them perhaps 2-3 times a week to the office and home.  They are already ripping in the back.  
I wouldn't recommend them; however, I do get many compliments about how cute they are.

I purchased 3 different Embassy purses last December.  None of them were the quality I had hoped for, and none were used as the gifts they were intended for.  In this case, the price should be a clue that the bags are cheaply made and not nearly as nice as they look in the pictures used.  I would not buy from this company again

I purchased these shoes for my upcoming wedding because I have a hard time walking in really high heels. They are extremely cute but the satin ribbon ankle strap doesn't hold my foot firmly in the shoe. When I walked around in them, I could feel them "flopping". Also, anytime I raised my foot (to simulate my fiance taking off the garter) there was too much gap between my foot and the shoe. So, just be aware of this if you decide to purchase this shoe. For the price, this is not worth the buy

The jock has good support but the material used is quite abrasive. The elastic and threads bite into your skin. If you use this one for sports, you will constantly be distracted. The feel of the material used is very rough against your skin, esp at the waist

I really really didnt like this product at all. I hated how it fit and the side ties are annoying, very hard to keep them tied. Also i'm petite so the dimensions of where thems were supposed to be were way off. The product would be much better if it came in auctual sizes as opposed to one size fits all

I loved the bathing suit the first time I laid eyes on it so I purchased it.  I'm actually small but I do have thick thighs so I got a medium.  But when it was delivered and I tried it on, it was too small!  I should have gotten a large.  The medium made me look like I had these big love handles.  So please whatever your size is make sure you get it a size bigger.  But other than that the bathing suit is great.  I'm just going to have to loose the love handles

Our 6-year old wants to be a policeman when he grows up. He could not wait to get this belt. We had purchased the police uniform earlier. The first time I ordered the belt, it got lost in the mail so he had to wait almost a month to get it. When it finally arrived, he could have wrapped it around his waist 3 times it was so long. It is made of very thin vinyl and does not hold up very well to having holes punched in it. It is less than 4 weeks old and probably won't make it through the rest of the month

I received the trousers in a timely manner.  They were what i expected although they did not fit.  I returned them a month ago and have not heard a word from the company.

This "pillow" is an inflated "U" that fits around your neck. One of the problems is, it has a rather sharp plastic edge around where it touches your neck. This can get pretty irritating the longer you use it.

Fortunately, it is dirt cheap, so then I guess you get what you pay for.

Shoe is comfortable but the description says off white or white with beige.  Which leads you to think the color is mostly white.  The true color is neither!  There is absolutely NO WHITE in these shoes.  I purchased these shoes because I needed some white off/white shoes NOT beige shoes.  No I did not return them it's too much of a hassel to return things so I kept them and I have worn them once but do not like the color at all.  The style is not as cute as her others but they are still a great bargain.  The materials are an excellent quality.  If you like beige &amp; earthtones you will like these shoes

Our company ordered these shirts from the Texas Shirt Company. While we were happy with the quality, our order was missing 2 shirts. Over a nearly 2 month period we sent emails and called customer service to let them know, but their customer service representative insisted that they were accounted for - as if to say we were not telling the truth. If you don't care about customer service then perhaps you might want to use them because the quality and pricing are good - but if you want to be treated fairly then pick another company

I purchased this item to keep my wife warm and cozy for the 12-hour flight to Japan.  However, it was way too thin to keep her warm.  After using it for about an hour, we ended up packing it back to the case and use the blanket given to us by the airline.  Since I spent over 40 dollars on this blanket I couldn't even throw this away.  I had to haul it around for the entire trip.  I do not think it is worth 40+ dollars.  10 dollars blanket would do the same (or even better) job than this

This was a nightmare order.I paid extra for expedited shipping to assure Christmas arrival.Package tracking log revealed that the shoes were not even shipped until AFTER Christmas -Disgraceful and unforgivable to have to tell my 7 yr.old grandson that his gift didn't make it.The shipping cost as much as the shoes and this company should be ashamed.They are also impossible to reach-Amazon couldn't even get them on phone.Thank goodness the shoes fit-I can't begin to imagine what a return would have been like. The product is great

These shoes look great but are horrible running shoes.  The soles are solid plastic and do not flex at all on impact.  I do not have knee problems but my knees hurt after running in these shoes.

They may be a good walking or all-purpose shoe but do not plan on running in them.  I returned them and plan to try something else

I am disappointed that this seller is ripping people off and plan to report the fact that my money was basically stolen from me. If people can't be honest in their transactions then online buying will eventually die out. Two thumbs down

I have ordered Intimo silk boxers in the past and have been happy with that purchase. So far the fabric in these cotton boxers is extremely stiff and they have not gotten any softer even after 4 washings. I will continue to wash these in hopes that the fabric will soften enough to be comfortable enough to be worn. I now know why I pay $15.00 for two pair of
Jockey's

The fabric is a little stiff at first, bust softens to a acceptable level after a few washes. The elastic band around the waist of these boxers contracts to the point where it wrinkles up the fabric. After a few hours of wear you have the indents of the crinkled up band on your skin and it feels quite uncomfortable. While cheap and nicely packaged, these things suck. Spend some money on decent underwear

I received the night gown, tried it on, and actually hated it.  The built in bra was loose, as was the top and there was just too much fabric up top.  The straps are too wide.  The rest of the gown was okay, although it too seemed too drapey and long.  

I sent the gown back 3 weeks ago, now, and have STILL not received a refund.  I am very disappointed with the whole transaction/product

I would not recommend these to anyone
I paid and have been waiting 6 weeks for my credit. Amazon must protect buyers better or lots of business will go elsewhere. It is only when problems arist that the true color of the marketing company comes to the surface. I am disgusted with this product

...the shoes weren't quite what I thought they would be, although for 40 bucks I probably shouldn't have been expecting the highest quality pump. They looked a bit cheap, and on top of it all, they were too small for me. There was no return slip in the package, no number to call, no way to send the shoes back to make a return, so now I'm stuck with 40 dollar cheap looking shoes that no one but my little neices can fit into--and they're a bit too young to be dressing like ladies of the evening. My fault for buying shoes at a place called "Hollywood Heelz," I should have known better.
I will say this though, I like the thin heel and the shoes came in a timely fashion. If I could fit them, I'd give them a 2-2 1/2 for that alone

I bought these because they cost less than Uggs. But there is no comparison. My old Uggs ruled, were totally comfy and warm. I bought these because I didn't have the money for Uggs and they said they were "sheepskin". When I recieved them they looked and felt different. The fur was not "curly and fluffy" like the Uggs, it was relatively short and not as soft. I called Bearpaw and complained and they assured me that they were not synthetic. But after several calls the owner told me " they are not 100% sheepskin, they are blended with merino wool" which is NOT stated anywhere on Amazon or their website. Also I am a designer/ decorator and I am very familiar with fabrics and fibers and I still say they're synthetic. I returned them, at my cost, and am waiting for a refund. You get what you pay for! I probably could have bought a better pair at Payless.
What happened next: They promised me they would refund my money if I returned the boots at my cost, instead they sent them back to me with no refund. Nice

I just found out that this shirt back-ordered after I was promised by Amazon BEFORE I ordered it that I will receive this item before December 23. I just now received notification that this item was shipped on the 24th, and I had purchased it on the 15th. This means I will not get it until after December 26th!

Because I bought this shirt to go with some camo pants for my sister, I was only able to give her pants without the shirt for Christmas. She had to leave back across country, and I am forced to send this shirt to her. How embarressing! Obviously it is Christmas time and if you're going to have a storefront on Amazon.com, you better get extra stock! The worse way to keep a happy customer is by backordering on Christmas and ruining a family member's present. Beware folks, you may not get this item when it says you will

These shoes were very cute, as I thought they would be from the pictures.  But because of the sides being so short, they were nearly impossible to keep on my feet when walking, especially when going up stairs.  I returned them after only wearing them for 1 day..

These shoes are no longer being made in Italy but in India.  The quality of the material utilized and the construction is cheap and nothing like they used to be.  I have worn this same style of Bostonian (Marco) for several years, and was completely satisfied.  This is a cheap imitation of what used to be a great, comfortable, well-constructed shoe.  Return to having them made in Italy!

The photo is quite deceiving.  This suit is made out of cheap polyester fabric that looks cheap, shiny, and is horrible to the touch.  My three year olds hate the uncomfortable stiffness.  Spend the extra money for a decent fabric that is actually practical for a toddler if they really need a suit

I just received this item and now I have to figure out how to return it. This clock is a piece of trash.  I never could set it correctly. Each time  I set the time it would advance the day when going to the normal function mode. The setting button are not protected or disabled when the clock is closed.  Even it it worked properly it is very dificult to set.
If you buy this clock you will regret it

The other reviewer is spot on. These are pretty (but not truly mirrored) and they broke after only 4 weeks use.  I bought a pair of aviators at a gas station that was made of much sturdier materials for half the price.  Definitely not worth the $16

They're pretty, but flimsy.  Very light construction.  The lens is not really mirrored, so if you attempting to hide your eyes, forget it.  It would be better to spend some real money and get a more professional pair than a cheap Chinese knock-off.  Gave them two stars simply because they are good looking, but cheap--and they feel that way on your face.

I have worn Jockeys for almost 20 years, but the quality has gone downhill dramatically in the past few years. The fabric covering the elastic waistband wears out very quickly, and the underwear is, for some unfathomable reason, heavily perfumed! I had to wash them at least 5-6 times to get the smell out. Plus, some of the elastic on the bottom was too tight, and some was so loose I couldn't wear them -- and they were all the same size. Very inconsistent quality. I do not recommend these anymore

Bought one for my new ipod nano, a total disappointment. Very poorly made. Only glued together not stiched up,It already started to go apart. You won't be able to connect your headset because the hole below the case is a bit too small.  Plus there is no belt clip or anything attacheable to one's self when walking or working out.  It looks pretty but that is all

the 2 bras i ordered were they same style, it even said so on the labels attached, however, they both look and feel different.  the white has a lot more padding, a rounder shape, and the lining is tearing away from the padding (part of the design).  The navy bra had a more pointed shape and less padding (which is what I wanted in the first place) I was also disappointed in the sparse stock that was on had...in addition, I had to wait an extra 2 weeks for one of the bras to come in because in the ordering screen I was not informed that it would have to be backordered.  not happy with my overall experience

The one size fits all doesn't fit my slim body...and the item looks "made in China" if you know what I mean.  Rather try the double pearl thong or black single pearl thong.  They look much "classier" than the transparent beads with nylon string of the "string of bubbles" panty

All I have had with this product is problems. the clip in the middle, kept popping open, even when it the wallet was close and my money would fall out, so i ended up removing the cheap clip and useing it for what ever. don't waste your money

These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!

I saw the reviews and ordered the bag, the first impression was it looked pretty good! I was happy, if I had rated it at that time it would have been 5 stars. The problem now is the threads have come out at couple of places on the front. I had to trim to remove the hanging threads. There are double stitches on the bag. the clip just above the calpack symbol, has come out. I suppose the ring which holds it has cracked. 

don't ask me, why I did not send it back... it costs 10 bucks which is one third the price of the bag, which does not make sense to send it back. It has started to give me the feeling that there is a price to pay for anything that is cheap! 

The next time, I'm going to branded bags, it is worth the price I guess.

On the other hand the rest of the bag seems to be ok! except for the defects on the front of the bag(mentioned above).

if u r lucky, u could have got a better bag

First I tried these pants on in my size and I looked like Kramer in that episode where Jerry dares him to wear jeans.  It was ridiculous.  I went back  to the store and bought them a little bigger and they are the best pair of jeans I've ever owned.

Only the front of the bag is actually beaded, and the quality poor. The original price should have been $5 or fewer, to be reasonable. This would make a better toy for a little girl than an actual accessory

I purchased this item judging by its comfort factor. All's well except the buckles do not have pins to hold the straps in place. The straps slip off occassionally, causing the shoes to come loose.

I ordered a pair of black cotton mary janes and I had the same problem with the turpentine smell. I was prepared for it because of reading other reviews and was willing to take my chances for the price. I wonder if any of the other colors or fabrics had the same problem. I washed them in vinegar water immediately after buying them and it helped some but they still stink. I'm going to wrap them in a clear plastic bag to transport them on the plane and hope they don't make my other clothes smell, and I'm still going to wear them and hope nobody else can smell them.

Even for only $12, these weren't worth the money.  They came smelling extremely strongly of turpentine, or some other noxious chemical and now, at least 2 months since I have received them, the smell has not dissipated.  They are extremely stiff, so even if they didn't reek, I still wouldn't wear them b/c my feet would be in tatters by mid-day.  I guess that's what I get for buying cheap shoes

The main thing here is that the bag shipped with out the strap.  I bought
it for my wife to carry "all that stuff" to work.  With out the strap it does not work.  I requested another one, got it, no strap.  On the plus side is the bag looked and felt as pictured and the packing was, if any thing, over done.

     Initially I was going to order several items from Andrew Christian, until I saw their shipping prices at checkout.  $2 shipping on EACH $4 tee-shirt was more than excessive, they were going to charge me $20 shipping on a $42 order!  I canceled most of the items, only ordering a belt and a tee.  Shipping was still ~ 50% surcharge.
     Received my order yesterday and found that the belt is defective.  The buckle is on backwards (no, it's not reversible...) plus the material of the belt itself is damaged by a frayed hole.  It isn't worth the shipping cost &amp; hassle to send it back, I'll probably just throw it away - but I did learn something.
     I will never deal with Andrew Christian again!  I you choose to, please pay attention to the shipping charges when you check out - you may decide to revise your order

I ordered a pair and they were too big...so when I asked for a RMA number to return and get a smaller pair they said they could only snail mail me a UPS Lable... one month later it did not come... Each time to emailed customer services they said they could only smail mail it and not email it to me.... whereas I know it is do-able.. Bargain Outfitters can as well as can Online shoes .. So finally I paid $15 to send the boots back. on my dine.. and no doubt they will not reimburse me for my $.. I not only had to pay shipping to get the boots but also they will no doubt chaarge me a re-stocking fee.  I will never ever buy from The Sportsman's Guide again...

I ordered 4 toddler long-sleeved tees' in the same size, I thought.  When I received the shipment, all 4 tees' were different sizes [even though they were all labeled the same size].  I have returned the items since the tees' run two sizes too small, and the workmanship is questionable, which translates into...that I will not be able to give this item to my loved one for Christmas.

I wish there was a rating of "0".  This was very flimsy and the armband is just slightly larger than the slot provided.   The armband cut through and tore the back completely off.   I am returning it

I would have loved it if they sent it, but after over 2 weeks of telling me that it was in stock &amp; on it's way, the company fessed up that they were out of the color that I chose. The other color that they wanted to sub. looked pretty bad so I cancelled

The pic that I ordered showed a knee length half slip.  Instead I received 3 long half slips from Her Room.  I cannot use the long half slips and I sent them back.
Also, I had bought them with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and couldn't find where to apply that, so the cost was put on my visa.
Thanks.

Straps on this shoe are very short and since they close with velcro, they are too short.  I tried to add velcro, but that didn't work.  I had to give the shoes away.  The strap rubbed across the top of the ankle and on the side of the foot and were very uncomfortable.  Would not recommend if you are on the heavy side

There's a fine line between tacky and hip, and these slippers are not it.  These slippers looked much cuter in the picture than they do in person.  Also, the only thing between your foot and the floor is a thin piece of rubber-y fabric.  They're not made for warmth.  All around disappointing

I have seen others wear these slides and I know Adidas usually supplies an excellent product. I did read the other reviews that warned of a need for "breaking in" the sole nubs and wearing socks during that process. However, I've worn these slides for 2+ months and they still make the soles of my feet tender unless I continue to wear socks.  I am disappointed in the slide but I will stubbornly continue to wear them. Maybe some day they will be "broken"

THESE ARE THE ABSOLUTE WORST THINGS i HAVE EVER BOUGHT. SERVES ME RIGHT FOR BY A SANDAL WITHOUT EVER HAVING TRIED IT ON. I WALKED AROUND THE BLOCK FROM MY HOUSE WITH THEM AND BARELY MADE IT HOME THEY HURT THE BOTTOMS OF MY FEET SO BADLY I MAY NEED TO TAKE AN EXTRA DAY OFF OF WORK. THE PART OF THE SANDAL WHERE IT MIGHT NORMALLY BE FLAT AND CUSHIONED HAS SHARPENED PLASTIC SPIKES KNIFING THE SOLE OF YOUR FOOT. TAKE YOUR MONEY AND THROW IT RIGHT INTO THE GARBAGE AND SAVE YOURSELF THE MISERY OF EVER HAVING WORN THESE SO CALLED SANDALS. AND I LOVE ADIDAS

These boots were super cute and earned rave reviews each time that I wore them out, although each boot split along the outside, toe sole after approximately 10 wears. These splits, although tiny, allowed my socks to get soaked when splashing through our giant West Coast puddles. I still wear them, but now only for fashion instead of function

I bought these for my younger than three month old son, he didn't even move around alot and in the morning the fabric that the snaps are attached to would be ripped off from the shirt.  I ended up having to throw them all away or keep sewing them back together.

I do not suggest that anyone buy these

The sweatshirt has a cardboard feeling that does not conform to the body. My husband is 6' 178 pounds, so he does not have a problem finding clothes that fit, but this one looked like a stiff kite on him. 
BE AWARE The items were returned and the vendor took over five weeks after receiving the item back to refund the money, and only after I had filed a complaint with Amazon. Amazon acted quickly to post the credit.

This shirt is too tapered in the body and sleeves and feels very confining. The people who like it must be quite thin, indeed. 

It does not wrinkle because of the high percentage of polyester but it doesn't breathe very well, either. 

I am giving it 2 stars only because of all the color choices, though why someone would want a dress shirt in some of the available colors is beyond me. 

For the price, you can do better, even at someplace like Target

Easy to install.  We used it for less than a month and it no longer rotates- you can still hear the engine running, but no movement.  Hardly any use at all- maybe 10 times.  We tried taking it apart to see if something simple was wrong and the screws are set so tight you can't open it to see the inner workings. I have never received a bad item from amazon before- I am very disappointed with this product.

These pants have a tendency to split horizontally for almost no reason at all. If they split alont the seam that would be one thing but to ctross a seam and just practically explode even when they fit loosely can only mean rotten fabric and that is what you will get when you buy these. I have lost the 3 pairs I biught to the self same calamity and always in public. Please save yourself the trouble. By the way the Lee version of these pants also do the same thing. Be afraid be very afraid.

I had bought these for my boy thinking they had a fly front much like the mens versions I wear. They are my son's least favorite underwear mearly cause he has to pull the front of them down in order to use the bath room. He's only 6 and when I had trained him I tought him to use the fly on the front of his underwear. In my personal thoughts are that men's/boy's underwear has a fly in the front for need use, unlike that for women and girls whom don't require it

I was glad to have finally found the right pair of boots, but it didn't last long. Not even 3 weeks after I bought it, it already has deteriorated. Given that I live in Seattle, rain seeped in really easily and the sole pads started breaking. It was like wearing melted cardboard

I wore Gold toes years ago and remember them as very high quality durable socks.  I discontinued using them because i started wearing  different styles than the crew/white/standard. Now after trying these fluffies i think i remember why i stopped liking the gold toes. perhaps they sold the co. or came under new management. in anyt case these socks have no stretch in the elastic, making them basically worthless. yippee

When I ordered this skort the description didn't say that it was a childs size.  So I complained to the site that I bought it from.  I asked that my shipping also be returned because they didn't specify that this was a childs size.  I wasted my money on shipping for an item I wouldn't have ordered if I had known it wasn't an adult sized item.  They didn't return my shipping

When this product came, it says "girls" - not a woman's size.  I'm a petite woman 5'2 105lbs and the medium was too tight for me - like a jr's size or "girls" size as the tag states.  Now I have to spend $$ sending this product back

I got it a few weeks ago. Although the light turned on in the charger (indicating the electrical socket is good), my shuffle only briefly flickered its charging/LED light.   I played around with it, but it seems it can't maintain contact and charge despite many attempts over several days.  I gave up and simply use my usb charger (with the stable base) hooked up to my laptop

I must say you are getting a very good price and these are very comfortable. You also do not notice anything "irregular".

However, I ordered these to use as boxers -- that is to wear them around the house. Not a good plan. These are very thin, plus the fly is very narrow. All in all, not very useful for my intended purpose

Not only charged 8.99 for it, 6.99 for shipping! Its a cheap plastic toy. But my grandson begged for it, and against my beter judgement, I ordered it.
Save your money. Its worth a buck, if that. I cant believe they have the nerve to sell it and not expect complaints for this garbage. Shipping is a complete rip off, and I will never order from this company again

Item was called "Fleese" but was 80% cotton and looked &amp; felt like a regular sweat shirt. To return an item to them, they give you free mailing, but they will deduct $5.95 off the refund for S&amp;H. After calling them about this, they agreed to give us a full refund. But the refund will not show up until after 2 or 3 billing cycles. I doubt that makes many consumers happy. Champion makes a fine line of products, but I will never deal with them on line agai

I am vey unhappy with the sales professional in Nautica outlet stores. I had a very bad experience at Nautica store outlet stores. The customer service representatives are very rude and unprofessional. They basically said they don't really care if they lose one customer, other customers will  still buy. ( if that is the case, why are prices slashed by 50%...it is because people do not want to pay the full price ...)I do not think I will ever buy from Nautica. A few uncaring sales represtatives give a very bad name to the whole company

I usually wear a men's medium waist for athletic shorts (Umbro, Adidas, Nike) and they usually fall just above my knee lengthwise.  Just to be safe I ordered a large.  The shorts barely made it past the midpoint of my thigh and my legs aren't overly long.  The waist fits well but if you're looking for a pair of workout shorts, I'd skip these unless you like to show a lot of leg.

i got the largest size they had (size 10) and my toes were crunched in. they fit my mom just barely, and she's a size 8. i wanted to get my money back for it, but it'd probably be more money just to ship the incredibly small slippers back, then it actually costed to begin with.

I love the t-shirt because I loved the movie, but just note that if you are typically bothered by restrictive neck lines and arms, this may present an issue for you.  The areas you see in the navy color have a tapering fit

I bought this wallet for my niece and then ended up returning it.  The quality is poor.  The wallet is really hard to use because the compartments do not open all the way.  Also, the wallet actually looked fake (not sure if it is) because the XOXO is upside down.  You cannot tell from looking at the picture.

This was my first online shoe order.  I figured it would be pretty safe since it was a slip-on.  I'm usually in a size 11 or 12, so I ordered a 12.  While my feet are pretty wide, I've never had to purchase wide shoes.

These shoes were incredibly tight.  They were long by about an inch, but the width was unbearably constricted.  They reminded me of squeezing on a pair of tight rock-climbing boots -- I really had to squish to get my feet in.

The result was so uncomfortable, these are going back.  I wouldn't have expected this from 'slip-on' shoes.  It gets a two instead of a one since the quality appears great

I have several pairs of genuine Birkenstock sandals.  The Betula sandals are clearly inferior.  A light grade of leather is used for straps which makes them impossible to slip my foot into.

With a title like 'swirl skirt,' you'd expect the fabric to be able to, well, swirl.  But the fabric is stiff and not very comfortable.  Plus, the cut (of the size 12 at least) was awkward, giving my tummy a bubble that wasn't even there.   And the last thing I want is for my tummy to look bigger than it actually is.  So I don't recommed this item

I liked the boots in the first couple of weeks-they are very warm and comfy, however they are not at all durable -after a month of use the soles had holes. My freind who had them experienced the same problem. 
They are great feet warmers when the weather is dry, but they are not waterproof.

I used to wear lame-ass Y-fronts when I was a kid and my boring folks did all the shopping. I made the switch to thongs after I got a girlfriend and she made it clear that I had to ditch the grandpa undies. So I did, and gladly! There's no way I could go back to this 'maxi' sh*t anymore. I tried one of my old pairs a few months ago and they look freakin HUGE!! I'm talking fat-guy big. You don't realize how big they are until you try modern stuff. So here's my advice: if you're still putting up with either boxers or briefs throw them in the trash right now and go buy something smaller. You'll be happy you did

Very disappointing!  I ordered STRETCH jeans.  I paid postage to get them here only to find out they are not STRETCH jeans.  I called cust. service.  He spent enough time with me and another department to find out that these jeans must be mismarked and if he (Bealls cust.serv.) sent me another pair I would get the same thing.  In order to get money back I had to return the item.  Now I've paid postage again! and Yes I did receive the $12.99 credit for the jeans, but what about the postage?  This was not my fault!  The item was INCORRECT!!  Your Return Policy indicates that yo uWILL pay the postage, so if you need to see a copy (which I also put in the return box) of what I ordered, please feel free to contact me.  I printed it out so I can fax it, scan it &amp; email it, or snail mail it, or however you would like to receive it.  Please return the shipping costs that I paid for a product that apparently mismarked.  thanks, Debbie Pearson P.S.  I see the title description has been corrected to show that these ARE NOT stretch jeans -- wish I would have known so that I would not have to be writing this review.  If no satisfaction is given there will be no more purchases via amazon, but especially not Bealls

This is a nice looking wallet, but the internal design leaves something to be desired.

There is an internal flap used for credit cards, etc, that makes the wallet too thick - even if you don't fill it with cards.  I am tempted to cut it out (it is stitched to the inside) to make the wallet less cumbersome.

The credit card slots are also too tight - so you have to pry the cards in and out - and run the risk of cracking or splitting the cards.

There is a nice display for your license - with a small hole cut in it so that you can push the license out with your thumb when needed (it is also in a tight slot)

I ordered a 7.5 M which is what I always wear in a shoe.  I couldn't even get my foot into the shoe.  I can tell you that it was way too narrow.  I don't know about the length because my foot wouldn't go in.  I had to return them.  I wouldn't buy another pair of Daniel Green's until I knew for sure how the sizes really run.  0 Stars

Ordered a pair...and they lost my first order.  Had to contact amazon to help. Finally got order..and pants were too small. So..had to RE order larger size.  Got pants in SAME size as last. Wrote back saying I know have TWO pair of pants that are too small.    
First they denied sending wrong size..then later wrote back saying they did make a mistate and that new order in correct size was on its way with postage lables to send pants back. Well a month later still have not recieved pants or lables.  Have wrote half a dozen emails asking for a reply and help..NO REPLY.  Never had such POOR customer service

The Zen cover didn't work that good. I had to cut off one of the flaps that covers the "buttons" because it was not made right.  I ended up taking the cover off and don't even use it anymore. It's not worth getting

Ordered the wand for x-mas and took it with us on vacation. When Santa came to the carribean the wand did not work. No light, no sound and cheap plastic that did not thrill anybody.

I ordered these items in mid June, and my credit card was billed on June 22.  However I discovered two weeks later that, despite your having billed my credit card for items being purchased from Andrew Christian, the order had never been sent to them.  I was then assured that the order would be completed promptly (I told them I needed the clothing by July 19, otherwise I would not need the items at all)).  The order was not given to UPS until July 17 with an expected delivery date of July 21. Consequently I directed UPS to return the order unopened.  The handling of the entire mess was slopppy, and the billing of my credit card two weeks before the order was even placed was unethical and shameful.

I bought these for my mom as a gift thinking, "hey, they're cheap, isn't all shearling good?" Not so much. The insides of these slippers felt similar to burlap. They were very sturdy! Not so comfy. 
They also ran about a size smaller than I ordered. I'm a size 7, and the 8's were a little small for my feet.

I'm not sure what product every previous purchaser received, but the case I received doesn't cut it for the 60GB. It fits in so tighly that the case depresses the buttons so that the user can not push them. I do NOT recommend this product for the 60GB. I suppose we Zen 60GB owners must resign ourselves to the fact that only those stupid skins will fit our players

For slip on slippers-no hands required-these do not pass the test. The small lip in the back does more harm than good.I ordered 1/2 size large and it was not enough. If you have high arches go 1 1/2 sizes larger or look elsewhere. The synthetic upper was more sweaty than comfortable

I placed order on 10/10. I called Blue Blood racing the shipper because i did find any shipping info on amazon and was that as of the 10/16 that my order had not been shipped. I that it would be shipped that day. I was told that I may get my item 10/23 or 10/ 24. Horrible customer service. The shipper also told me that there was some kind of problem with my shoe that is what took so long, but i was not contacted and told that there was a delay in receiving my item. I will not order from Blue Blood Racing again!!

Per the description, it sounded like these would fit snug.  Well, they fit too snug, feeling very cramped. I have a 33 inch waist, and ordered the 32/34 waist.   I'm used to boxer briefs made from cotton.  This was the first time that I've got polyester boxer briefs.  Unless you like 'um really tight, you might want to go to the next size up, or just get cotton briefs.  I'm throwing these away

For the price, this product should receive the Cruciatus Curse ad infinitum. The material is all synthetic (I was expecting a wool blend, though the ad said nothing about what the hat and scarf were made of), the relatively loose weave means it will not last as long, and one of the tassels fell off the scarf after just one wearing. I dislike being taken advantage of just so I can make my daughter happy. She is disappointed as well. It was a lot of money to pay to get the Hogwarts crest on a patch that wasn't even fully embroidered. J.K. Rowling should be upset that English Woolens, with which this product will be associated by people who are not in the know, will acquire such a poor image because of the greed of the licensing people

The Scarf arrived with several holes in it. My daughter was very dissappointed, crying and wondering why Santa sent this to her. We ordered well in advance before Christmas but the set arrived too late. We were never notified that there would be a delay in shipping. A few days before Christmas it arrived! It was too late to do anything. Amazon should improve the quality control of vendors before it allows them to list on their site.

These shoes look great on, however are extremely uncomfortable.  They run VERY small in size (I went up 1 1/2 sizes from what I normally wear in SM brand).  

I would not recommend them as shoes you would wear for more than an hour at a time because the thong portion cuts into your skin and the arches in the heels are so high that they put alot of pressure on the ball of your foot

I do like this t-shirt.  I liked the organic cotton and the general style.  But I will never buy American Apparel again.  Not only are they VERY labor and union unfriendly, their ads exploitive of young girls (I mean, I can tolerate some of the young models in general, but these are particularly young girls in amature porn-looking situations), but a friend's daughter had a particularly unsavory experience working in one of their stores.  

I know I can find a cosy organic shirt elsewhere.  ick

I have a pair if clogs from Europe that I wear in the operating room.  I need to replace them.  They are European size 50.  So what's the deal?  You don't make your shoes in Men's sizes.  You think we all have girley feet?  Get with it, clowns.  Real men occasionally wear clogs too.  You can't make a size 16

I have worn these shoes less than 5 times and the leather detailing has already worn away. The shoes look cheap, not typical of the nine west brand.  I would not purchase this item again. I thought I was getting a good deal but have simply added to my collection of boots that can be thrown on to do yard work.

It clearly states for the shell material 100% nylon. The price and the nylon shell was the main reason I bought the jacket. The jacket is completely polyester. The tag says Shell: 100% polyester and Lining: 100% polyester. Returning it would be pointless. I'm very disappointed in the accuracy of the information

The sizing on this cardigan is way off.  I ordered a women's medium and it looks like a child size large.  The sleeves are about 4" too short and the overall profile is far too small.  To make matters worse, I ordered it as a X-mas gift and by the time we opened presents we passed the 30 day return window and I'm stuck with a bad product

Tommy, what were you thinking?  Although they are lovely to look at, they are absolutely the most uncomfortable shoe, bar none.  The shoe bed is too small to accommodate the average foot and they slip off when you walk, I even tried a smaller size thinking that was the problem, I was wrong.  Take this design back to the drawing board and start again.

For the money I spent on this bra it should be a better bra all around.  It gives a classic "torpedo" shape to the breasts, does not offer any lift, and is pretty much unwearable.

We had purchased another hair beader where you placed a clasp at the bottom of the beds to keep the beds from falling out of your hair. The idea of this product where you could place a single bead on your hair was very intriguing.  My daughter was excited when she opened the box and  she had decorated her hair with multiple beads and it looked nice.  The problem started when we attempted to remove the beads from her hair.  The directions tell you go gently pull the springs apart and slide them from your hair.  Well, we pulled the springs apart but to get the beads out of her hair we needed to destroy the bead because the hair was tangled in the springs.  None of the beads could be reused and my daughter is afraid to use the product again because it pulled her hair when we removed the beads.  She has very long hair with a lot of wave so I guess if you had short, straight hair, this product would be fine for you

I bought these shoes a few months ago because I liked the style of them. I wore them just about everyday. A couple of people started telling me "you walk kind of funny in those shoes". They caused my ankles to turn in.I was having ankle pain and my doctor confirmed it was from the shoes. The support (curves) of the shoes are poorly designed. I ran into another women wearing them and walking the same way. I asked her about them and she said she too was having ankle pain. I contacted the company who said I could mail them to the company (at my expense) and they would "inspect" them. If they felt it was a "manufacturers defect" they would replace them with the SAME product. Little good that would do. ALSO If they felt it was not a defect they would just send them back with a note explaining their decision.Don't waste your money and cause yourself pain too. The company may say "they stand by their merchandise" but they don't mean it!

sometimes you get a good bargain - cheap price for a good quality shoe.  this case is a classic - you get what you pay for.  cheap price for a CHEAP shoe.  

1)this shoe is very heavy for a comfort shoe.
2) no arch support whatsoever. The rubber is almost too thick.
3) i have SERIOUS doubths that this is a leather shoe.  feels like CHEAP VINYL AT BEST.  3 days into wearing them and it looks like my shoe is going to rip in half any minute.  this paper-like vinyl/leather is pretty thin and cheap looking.  

this is by fat the worst pair of skechers i have owned ( this is my #14 pair

While they are certainly bold and noticeable -- and have a handy security flap on the back to cover your personal information -- they aren't even close to being "leather." I don't think I would have bought them if I saw the cheap stitching and smelled the strong vinyl stench beforehand.  Not really worth the price and definitely not worthy paying the extra shipping charge from the seller

I bought these shoes for work to wear with my scrubs (with socks). I had to return them due to several issues: The inside lining was too slippery. I went for a brisk walk and my feet slid so much inside the shoe that they felt like they were on fire from friction! Tightening them did not work, as the top of the shoe tore away the skin from the top of my foot, leaving open sores. Even when walking at a normal pace, the shoe kept sliding away from my heel when I stepped. Thirdly, the sole of the shoe is very narrow; it felt like walking in ice skates! These were very cute...and may be great for biking, but not so great for everyday walking

:( these will give you pain. I bought these shoes because they looked rather cute in the picture, and considering they weren't just a $5 pair of shoes, i thought they would be somewhat comfortable, if not doable, to wear.  BUYER BEWARE:  these shoes will cut your heels.  they run a little small, so i suggest getting at least a half size larger.  if you want to do anything BESIDES sitting and looking pretty, DO NOT buy these shoes. I walked for less than 2 minutes before they started tearing and blistering my heels.  they also are a little tight on the toes, so if you have a wide foot, these definitely are not for you. i have to admit, they are darling and cute, but they are NOT WORTH THE PAIN.

One of the pairs of magnets that is supposed to keep the flap closed are oriented in such a way that the same polarity face each other. Genius! Not. The result - the flap would not close and leave a gap that just keep on repelling each other. grrr...

I never wear this top after having purchased it.  The stripes have awkward stitches that irritate the skin touching them.  The shirt itself hangs very awkwardly.  I prefer fitted shirts for working out and this one kind of flares out at the waist on me and, therefore, isn't very flattering.  I think I've worn it once and will probably donate it soon.  Generally, I have been pleased with Adidas products, but this shirt did not work for me personally.

I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband, and while I wasn't expecting the best quality in the world (because of the price), I was still a little disappointed. The company did a wonderful job of packaging/shipping the product-even the buttons were individually protected. I paid for expedited shipping, but they still cut the deadline close, so I was nervous about it arriving in time. The lining on the inside is thick and bulky so it isn't as streamlined as the pic implies, and tends to make the leather bulge a bit in places. (It was lumpy-looking even in the box.) Removing the zip-out lining doesn't change this--there's significant padding in the shoulders. It's also a shinier leather than expected. Sizing chart seems a bit inaccurate--I ordered a size larger than he normally wears in coats (which is a size larger than his regular clothing), but it was still too snug in places, lining or not. Overall, though, I'd say I got what I paid for, if you don't count the unusually high shipping charges. (Even standard shipping and handling charges were unusually high compared to other companies.

Since it took over two weeks for delivery, I am uncertain as to the efficiency of the return/refund.  The sashes are not the quality that I thought was represented by the term "charmeuse", and are thin and gauzy.   They came in a large padded envelope with a total wt of under 4oz, much of that must have been the packaging.  A quick refund will restore some trust in this vendor and the transaction

I purchased six of these chairs in August for myself and my friends before the start of the college football season for tailgaiting.  They were all made by this manufacturer (North Pole) and had different NFL logos on them (I only bought one through Amazon, the others were bought through different companies due to availability issues).

At the first game of the season, my chair (Steelers) broke.  At the second game of the season, two more chairs (Bengals and Broncos) broke.  They were not misused and no weight limits were exceeded.  They all broke in the same exact place; the plastic pieces at the base of the legs all cracked.  Therefore, 3 out of 6 broke within probably less than 3-5 hours.

Needless to say, at $25-$30 each I would recommend prospective buyers to spend their money elsewhere

The quality of this product cannot in any way compare to the genuine Apple iPod covers.  It is very flimsy, does not fit correctly, does not come with a belt clip and most importantly leaves the display area wide open to scratches and breakage.  That's right; there is no plastic or glass protection for the display area. 

There is a reason why this product does not cost as much as other iPod covers.  That's because it is of poor quality.  Also, when you calculate the cost of the cover, plus the cost of shipping it, you do not get a bargin.  As a matter of fact, if someone gave me this product for free, I would not accept it because, like I stated earlier, it provides no protection.

The product would have been great, but the store these came from sent the wrong sizes and did not respond to my emails on what to do to exchange them for the correct sizes. I requested XL Long pants. They sent size 3X pants. So they are completely unusable, and do not respond to my emails. I would never order from them again

This bra was well made, fabric very soft but the sizes were way off. Cup is cut to big, it would be difficult to wear a scoop, or v neck top , as the cup covers to much of chest area. Would not buy this brand again or style again, even for $7 each

I bought 2 Lilyette Embroidered Minimizer bra's here and both of them broke within one week.  I have never had such a negative experience with a product before.  Where the straps attach to the cup there is no strength in the attachment &amp; they broke right away. Since I don't know how to get my money back or an adjustment, this cost me approx $60 for a loser of a purchase. My suggestion: Don't waste your money on this one

I never wanted to write one of these, but I feel I have to. I bought these boots, they were great, but one size too big. So I tried to exchange them. Amazon doesn't do exchanges.....apparently too difficult. On top of this, the price doubled after I bought them, so now if I want the boots, Amazon will not honor the previous price. This is something that any dime store would do, but apparently one of the world's largest online retailers couldn't. This is very disappointing, and I would never recomend this company to anyone....ever....quite the opposite

I bought this watch from REI.  The first one's electronics gave it up on the first night when I connected it to the PC.  On the second two the plastic housing started separating.  That's right, I had to return the watch THREE TIMES, the 3rd time I just wanted my money back.

Also, it seems you have to hold your wrist up facing the sky if you want a reading.  Too bad, the watch sounded so good..

Please do not spend your time and money with this wristtop. I received with battery problems, it does not charge completely and suunto does not have the proper tech service available to fix it. You have better and cheaper options such as forerunner 201 or 301 or the timex trail runner. The suunto signal detection is quite weaker and when hiking grand canyon the unit remained most of time without capturing signal at all

"I am an honest seller and I insure 100% satisfaction to my customers.  I can also ship out a better quality beanie visor hat for you. 
 
Please withdraw the feedback:" -JTF Trading

Don't bother. I bought a better product from OldGlory. The feedback stays. People should know what they are buying. -Me

"Not a problem.  1 feedback doesn't hurt us at all because all of our other customers know about our products and our excellent customer service." -JTF Trading

Well, I guess all I can do is you "other customers" know what a POS this hat was. That, and I had the hassle of this guy emailing me after I thought I made it clear that the matter was closed. 

Try OldGlory for a better deal and a better product

I have a 33-34 waste. I bought the medium size because it is  advertised to be fit for 32-34 waste. The thing is too tight! It almost blocks circulation to my legs. Plus, the fabric is not entirely pleasant to the touch. I was mostly disappointed with this product. You can find a much better value at this price

I have usually found Jockey underwear to be a value in that they generally last a long time, which makes it a little less painful when you have to pay the premium price that appears to be controlled, no matter where you find them sold. However the last couple of their articles that I purchase through Amazon, namely the Pouch Trunk Underware, and "A" style under shirts appear fine out of the package but shrink to about half size when laundered. I wear a medium size (32" waist medium build) and purchased the same in both products. And both of these products are "painfully small" after laundered. I tried to wear them anyway, hoping that they would stretch out to their original size as the day wore on. But they were just uncomfortably too short, and tight.
By the way, I laundered them in cold water, just like I do all my clothing

"Sling" is a misnomer for this gimmick...think "tourniquet" and you'll be closer to the reality.   There are several buttons and eyes on the "sling" to adjust the fit.  I tried every configuration, and they all felt too tight.  A snug fit would be more tolerable if the thing stayed put, but my experience was the same as that of other reviewers:  the noose slipped off after an hour or so of walking around.   Despite the problems with the strap, I like the briefs.  My recommendation is to buy briefs sans strap.  The sling technology needs more R&amp;D before it's ready for the Big time

The Sling Support feature on these underwear is practically useless. My testicles always slip completely out of the sling before I've had them on for even an hour. If these briefs enhance a man's "profile" at all, it's because they're so darn tight; it has nothing to do with the Sling Support. And talk about "low-rise"--the top of my crack is exposed even when they're pulled all the way up.  I'm in pretty good shape, but if these things shrink in the dryer, I won't be able to fit into them anymore. My advice: anybody ordering C-INÂ² briefs should go one size larger than what he'd normally wear

I ordered the 50's Style Rockabilly Polka Dot Dress in a 1X. I am a full sized woman with a small waist and a well endowed chest. The cup size for the 1X looked to be about a C cup at the most. I sent back the 1X for the 3X in which the cupsize looked to be a D, the dress has no support what so ever in the chest area so a bra is a must for heavier chested women. The waist and back area was way too large in the 3x. I was not only displeased with the fit but the quality of the material is poor as well. The dots are screenprinted on so after a few washes they will begin to crack and fade, it does say handwash (but even still some of the dots are already lighter than others). I'm giving the dress two stars because the style of the dress is really nice and if you can get it to fit the right way its not a bad price at all, but it's definitely not a dress that your going to have around for a long time.

I ordered this product for a friend's bday since I got these same boots and loved them.  I waited weeks and weeks for her to call me and tell me how much she loves them.  Except it NEVER happened.  I was told the product went out over 2 weeks ago, I call amazon and they tell me to call macys.  I call Macys and they tell me to call amazon.  I've been told the item went out and must have gotten lost in the mail.  Then i am told the product was never sent out cuz it's been backordered and that Aerosoles cancelled the order.  Although now i've told my friend she's getting these boots and now she's not.  I've also been charged for these boots over 2 weeks ago and have made half a dozen calls to amazon and macys and had to explain this whole story to 10 different ppl and spent over 2 hrs of my LIFE trying to get this resolved.  Do yourself a favor and go buy this at the store or directly w/ Aerosoles.  I will never buy anything from amazon or macys online again.  WORST customer service ever and I am SOOOOO pissed right now

This is a very styling money clip, however, it is not like a big paper clip. It opens like a butterfly, then closes together with the strenght of the magnets. It feels that your money and other cards might fall off. I'm not sure if the magnet could wipe of your credit card information

The shoes look and wear great.  However, the leather is pretty weak.  I think I must have kicked a table leg or something on my frist outing in them.  Now the tip of my left shoe has a quarter-size scuff on it.  I will have to try to cover it up by oiling it.  Obviously I don't think this pair will last long at all

"Classic" sweatpants have elastics around the ankle to keep out of your way for biking, (and now "spinning"?)  I hate this new style where the manufacturer saves money by imitating fashion jeans, leaving the elastics out and letting the ankle cuff drag on the floor. Dangerous for working out, and certainly not "classic!"

Even though I bought these for $9.99 I still somewhat regret it. The quality of the jacket is "really" poor. Every parts of the jacket is poorly constructed-- from the pockets to the zippers. While wearing it, the jacket smells like "paint" or what they used to bleach the colors on. I hope the smell gets out after washing. I am a little concerned whether the colors will rub off easily when I wash it and onto my other clothes

I am a bit disappointed in the quality.    It looked like a possible reject off the factory line.  There are threads uncut and the velcro was sewed wrong in one of the side pockets.
You really should not expect too much.  You may find something better quality in some of your local cheap department store chain.

IF YOU ARE A WEIGHTLIFTER OR BODYBUILDER, THE YOKE PIPING WILL CUT INTO YOUR LATS AND PECS UNLESS YOU BUY A LARGER SIZE THAN USUAL. THIS RESTRICTIVE BAND MAKES THE JACKET RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE. THE VELCRO ISN'T QUITE RIGHT EITHER. THE MATERIAL ITSELF IS NICE TO THE TOUCH, BUT THE DESIGN IS FLAWED...WASN'T WORTH EVEN THE SALE PRICE.

I was looking forward to this being a great nursing bra - I loved the cotton, one-hand closures, and the lack of underwires.  It felt and looked great when I tried it on, but after a few hours of wearing, it had the classic problem of riding up in the back.  Eventually I gave up wearing it at all.  I bought mine in a boutique where I was professionally fitted, so I had the right size (34F).  I'd recommend a Bravada bra for larger sizes, they consistently fit great and stay put.

This coat was listed as camel, but when it arrived it was actually tan.  Even the tag says tan.  I was disappointed because it was the only Christmas gift that I had for my husband.  I never would have ordered a tan.  Also the coat fit like a whole size larger.  I had to return it and it has been well over a month and I still have not received my refund

I just mailed those back this past week to Beall's in Florida.  However,
when the mailman took it from my mailbox (I am 83 and no car) he brought it back the next day because of insufficient postage on it.  There was $l.71 due.  So, I put  (5) 39 cent stamps on it, which would have been 
$1.95.  However, the next day the mailman brought it back and there were only 3 additional stamps instead of the 5 I  had put on  it.  I called the post office, and fortunately, the postmistress believed I was being honest, and told me to send it back with the mailman.  He wasn't a happy camper, but I did send it back, and I trust that she went ahead and mailed it for me.  I was concerned that it might have been too late for an exchange.  Other than the fact that the pants were too large in the legs and around the hips....they were okay, but by that time, I had changed my mind about them, too.
Also, I had bought these with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and never could find a place to apply it.

was poor. HOwever, if you are strapped for money then they are certainly

This jacket is worst outerwear that I have ever seen, although the image might look good in here. My size is usually between medium and large, I ordered size medium. However, when I received and tried it on, I end up look like wearing XXX-large jacket. Also, the craftmanship is very poor, the jacket feel uncomfortable and not smooth due to its uneven cut and badly sewing. I hate to return anything that I had order online because I have to waist my time to go to post office and I have pay the shipping and handling fee. Nevertheless, I returned it yesterday. Please don't waist your money on this order, it's not worth it at all.

The problem I have with this purchase does not involve the product, but rather the company that I purchased them from. I had these shoes sent to my son as a gift. Unfortunately, they were shipped with the ink-filled security button still in place, so he was unable to wear them, and since they were an online order item, it has been an extreme inconvenience to make a return. The company sent another pair of shoe with the instructions that they would also send a pre-paid mailing label, so my son could return the original pair. When I spoke to my son last week, he had not yet received the return label. I am waiting now to see if my credit card has been billed twice for this item. I am very unhappy with this purchase

Can you say P A I N? This is what Steve Madden shoes are. Pain.
The soles must be made of cast iron. The upper materials must be made of the roughest of rope or some material meant to be deliberately scratchy and rough. I am convinced that this Madden person HATES WOMEN. If it were in my power, I would track down Steve Madden and force said person to wear their own shoe designs, Only Standing, Walking and .....Dancing even until they committed to making shoes that are fit for human beings to wear without any pain.

I ordered this item with the hope of finding a new home for my ever-growing collection of credit cards, grocery store cards, insurance cards, club cards, hotel cards, airline cards... you get the point.  I was disappointed to discover that placing more than one card in the wallet prevents the "Accardion" from collapsing enough to zip close.  I can't imagine how such a defective design would ever have made it to market.

Unless you want a really large leather case for a single credit card, I would not recommend this product

I bought this for a woman who is a small size eight, one of those people who is just a touch too big to wear a size six, and normal medium sized clothes usually run very loose.  Not this tiny shirt. It looked all right when she opened the package, but when she wore it, it made the kid look as if she had flub.  It was inexpensive enough that I won't bother returning it, but the item, although well made, was sized so small as to be useles

The trunks look great as long as you don't get them wet because once you get them wet they become see-through.  I guess that could be advantageous for some, but i was looking for something to wear on public beaches

In my previous review, very happy to receive my KC shoes but to my surprise these were a "disappointment"!  Very cheap looking, there were some visible defects (noticed right away), too small and the bottom of the shoe looked worn. Tribeca's are my favorite KC shoes but again, if you wear a 9, go a size up for a better fit and comfortability.  

Good luck, shoe shoppers

WARNING!!! Can not use button features to operate Zen player because leather case is way too tight!  You can hardly get the player into the case so no amount of time or breaking in period is going to fix the problem. Sadly, it's like having a pair of shoes that are so tight you have to remove them so you can walk. [...

You can use this case for storage which is what I do now. It doesn't allow me to click the buttons, the bottom two since it squeezes it already and it's down so I can't access them. Overall, it's ok for just keeping your player in there. I really recommend an invisible shield, it works better than this case for sure. This case is a bit bulky, but it's alright if you don't mind taking the player out to press the buttons to change songs and put it back in. Sometimes when you put it back in, it will accidentally press one of the buttons which can be annoying and pretty much is. Basically, if you want a case to keep it in this isn't too bad, but another product is better for sure. Either my case was jinxed or they are all like that.

I purchased this case after getting tired of waiting for Creatives leather case to become available.  As far as appearance, it is well crafted.  When it comes to functinality, it stinks.  Here are the problems I have with it:  1) there is no hole for the microphone,  2) the hole for the headphone jack is not lined up properly, 3) the charger and sync adapter brick can't fully engage the player because of the leather straps, so it is easily disengaged by the slightest movement.  This is ok at home, but try using this in the car (if you want to charge while you listen); it falls out with every turn you make.  This case was not designed with much thought about the functions of the zen player

I loved the look of the boot.  The price was great. I guess you get what you pay for.  They run a size small.  There is also some sort of design flaw with the zipper function and location.  You break out in a sweat trying to get the boots on and off. Believe me, I tried.  I really wanted to keep the boots based on the look.  Once on, they were really awkward to walk around in because the wedge had no give at all.  I am pretty good in heels being in a band and always wearing some kind of trendy shoe.  I tend to be pretty easy.  I just could not make these work!  Sorry

I bought this from a different vendor and started working out with it immediately, interspersing it with my usual cardio workouts.  I usually lift weights, have no prior injuries, and consider myself in pretty good shape as well as pretty used to working out and using proper form (I played a college sport, etc.).  After a couple days of using this product my neck and shoulders started spasming and were so stiff that I could barely move them regularly.  It was clearly not from the amount of weight since i am used to using much heavier (free weights included).  Perhaps I was doing the exercises incorrectly, but that seems like a real risk with a video like this.

Sorry to give such a bad review but I can't in good conscience give a better one. I did this workout one time with the 8 lb. ball and have not been able to do any kind of exercise since. I am entering my second week of taking pain killers for my messed-up lower back. There are several segments (including ab work) where the ball is held with straight arms and moved from the down position to up over the head as well as twisting side-to-side. While doing these moves, I kept thinking that they really did not seem sound for that much weight. Sure enough by that evening I was dying! Perhaps they'd be ok if you used the lightest weight ball. I am in good shape and have actually been doing the P90X extreme workouts. I am accustomed to using 20-40 lb. weights and do Tae Kwon Do and I do not have any back problems. I snatched this up when I finally found it for a good price and did it on an off day. Just be forewarned-it is really easy to hurt your back with this workout. I LOVE ALL the other Firm workouts but will never do this one again. Additionally, when I received this from Amazon the ball was misshapen &amp; the DVD case was broken from the weight of the ball. They immediately sent a replacement which was damaged in exactly the same way

This bag is so cheap looking I am embarrassed to use it.  When I saw it online it looked identical to a US Luggage bag I bought at TJ Maxx, which was stolen.  So, I was very excited to find what I thought was the same bag on Amazon to replace it.  When I got it, I was shocked at how cheap it looks.  The handles especially are plastic leather and just hideous.  The return policy through eBags is such a hassle that I am just going to keep it and use it for bringing my laptop to and from work, but I will still need to find a better travel laptop bag.  I'm very disappointed.  If you're looking for a professional looking laptop bag, this isn't it.  I should have known better for the price, but like I said, I thought it was the same as the other US Luggage bag I had, which was gorgeous and I loved it.  Oh well.

I was so disappointed in this product.  I bought the ad hook, line, and sinker, thinking that the memory foam was a great idea, that it would give me bilateral-plantar-fascitis-suffering feet some long-awaited relief.  After about 2 hrs of wear, the foam is completely flat, which leaves the formerly snuggly slippers sloshing around on your feet and you flapping about as if walking on cardboard. SAVE YOUR MONEY!  These are awful

While this product appears very nice in pictures and upon arrival, it does not function to transmit the IPOD via FM frequency.  It can hook to the IPOD, cradle the IOPD and charge the IPOD, but it does not transmit.  The product was made in China but has no other company information to search for techincal assistance or return.  While I could probably process back through Amazon and the seller, it is not worth my effort.

All in all -- a complete loss of cost and shipping for this product

They run MUCH smaller than Birkenstocks. I sent the size 44 back (which is comfy in the comparable model in Birkenstocks; is it the Boston?) and got the 45 and it STILL feels small. The upper is ok, the shoe isn't the best made thing but is adequate; it's just the size thing that bothered me

Does not say on amazons site that these are shipped in narrow widths only.  Supplier does not carry the wide ones.  Birkenstocks are normally wide unless you specify narrow widths.  Not here.  No exchange possible.  Now I'm stuck with shoes that don't fit and midwest sports couldn't care less. I won't ever order from them again

Well, it is a cool product, and good idea to use. But the bulb was broken in first 3 days. We put the second one on. Dont know how long this second one will last. We used it only few minutes in the morning, when we need to get some cloth out of closet.

Also, it is not on line product only. I found Bed Bath Beyond has it and CVS has it. They sell 9.99. Without extra bulb. But still, misleading to say online only.

Maybe, just maybe, someone will buy one of these Stick Up Bulbs and maybe, just maybe, the bulb will last more than about 10 minutes of total use before it burns out. I thought to myself "buy another one because maybe this one was defective." I bought three more.....every time the tiny bulb burned out in minutes of use. It's a great idea....but a worthless piece of junk. The spare bulb? Useless as well. 

Don't waste a dollar on this junk. If I could have found the receipts I would have gotten my money back.

I got both my sons these socks and really liked the performance, thickness, etc. However, it has been only two months and several of my three year olds' socks now have holes in the toes, the heels, and you can see the fabric wearing thin and about to have holes at other places. My 8 month olds' socks are fine, however, he doesn't give them the wear of a three year old. So if you have a baby, these socks are great! If you have a preschooler, very poor choice

My son runs true to size on most clothing including Childrens Place but the PJs run very small and when I held them up to each other the different patterns were sized different.  At 5 months he is still wearing 3-6 mo in most PJs but already grown our of Childrens Place 6-9 mo PJs.  I bought several pairs and some of them he never could wear.  Buy a different brand unless you can go to the store and actually try them on

In theory this boot seemed perfect: added some height , came in  perfectly wearable colors, was made of real leather, the price was unbeatable , BUT ( yes, unfortunately a big but)like everything else which seems perfect , it was perfectly flawed . I did my research,read the reviews and ordered a boot half size bigger than my usual . But still was super tight across the ankle and top of my feet , totally crushing my veins. I'm a big "shoe collector" and I can recognize a design error when I see one. Surprisingly that it came from this brand , usually so quality-reliable . These boots are not meant for walking . If you want to take a pretty picture in them , they might fulfill THAT purpose

Good features include many pockets.

Bad feature is the poor quality of the vest lining. As a result, the two pockets where I carried car keys developed holes after a couple of weeks.

Avoid this product if you intend to carry keys in the pockets.

I thought this case would be like the ipod cases I have seen that look like they are actually part of the ipod; it is not.  The case does not fit properly on the ipod and slips off the top leaving room for damage.  The belt clip is difficult to get on and off and the stand doesn't work well.  Overall I would not recomend this product

I bought this as a surprise for my wife.  When we opened it, I thought that 1) we were shipped a pillowcase by mistake or 2) they hadn't finished it.  Edges are raw and unfinished.  It is a complete waste of money because returning it will mean that the shipping both directions will cost me more than the dress cost.  I understand that "you get what you pay for," but this was a piece of garbage.

This dress in the picture is OBVIOUSLY pinned and pulled back to give it any shape whatsoever.  The picture does NOT accurately represent this item at all.  This will fit like a potato sack, folks.  I notice that the "raw edges" are now listed as a "feature."  Ahem.

In a recent e-mail exchange with them, I was told that (their words now): "quality is a subjective issue."  They have pestered me to change my feedback and I have challenged them three times now to point out any inaccuracies in my feedback, and I would absolutely recant them.

In their defense: my money has now been refunded.

Now... anybody want to buy a pillowcase with three holes in it, worn for 90 seconds?  It would have been off sooner, but my wife was laughing too hard to get it back over her head.

Wish I could rate as a "zero

Save yourself the trouble and get the BRAIDED (3-line) latex hose type of clothesline. Want suction cups / rings / snap hooks, etc? Buy them for pennies at a drug store. The problem with this clothesline is that you can't make your clothes stay in position with only 2 lines--they slide down to the lowest point in the middle. The only way you can keep clothes somewhat separate so that they'll dry is with a braided line, period.

I was going to surprise my girlfriend with a nice "just because" gift. When I opened the package I was really disappointed. The color of the item was more brown than eggplant and the quality of the fabric was like stitching shop rags together. 
Now I have to return the item because it just looks bad. The problem with returning is the non-refundable $7.50 to ship to me and the $5.95 I have to pay to ship it back to them. 

I also have to take away a star for receiving the item late and having to hassle with their customer service department who couldn't find my order.

Shouldn't Amazon address this in some way? If it is real I would buy it; if it is fake (and the previous poster certainly seems right on that score) shouldn't this be off Amazon's site? I think it becomes an issue of Amazon's credibility..

I purchased a bag from this vendor, thinking that by being affiliated with Amazon that they were legit.
I got the bag and thought it looked fake.  The vendor told me to take it to the nearest boutique.
The boutique confirmed that it was NOT authentic, so I am returning the bag I got from Moda Party and feel cheated by the high price paid for a phoney, unauthentic bag

These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!

This wallet is fifty-fifty. The inside is great and holds cards as a wallet should. The outside, well... ...the UNCOVERED metal clip does not press against the leather so you need about 10 folded bills to get the right thickness to close the gap between the inside of the clip and the leather - less than 10 bills and expect the bills to separate from the wallet - in your pocket (ok) but not good in the open. Maximum number of bills - about 20 folded. Occasionally press down the metal closer to the leather as it gets farther apart as it is used. The metal clip on the outside is not good to your trousers. If the clip is facing out - before too long the trouser will have a horrible looking mark from rubbing that part of your thigh against your hand or even worse, other objects. So I started facing the clip in, resting against my thigh - not very comfortable but not too harsh to leave a mark on your thigh. But `facing in' is very awkward when seated, like driving. Definitely not designed for back pockets. Why Buy: As a second wallet (one should have at least two wallets - to separate credit cards, IDs so all is not lost if one wallet is lost/stolen. Put the small bills and one or two ONLY small limits credit cards in your back pocket wallet - pull the back pocket one out for the bandits and run away with this other wallet on you). As a gift for any guy - romantic or non-romantic

A year or so ago, I bought several of these on sale.  They are poorly sized (I have 4XT), far too tight for a big man like me to wear comfortably.  Maybe you could order several sizes too big to get a good fit, but unless you want everyone to see every roll of fat, I'd avoid buying these

We have a big smiling rubber rat in the state store where I work, but he isn't nearly as menacing as this sucker! In fact's he's kinda friendly. This guy's a beast...blood red eyes, sharp claws, looks like he'd take your throat if you slipped and fell in the bathroom. No ordinary broom neccesary here, friends, no, what you need is a can of mase and a nightstick. Buy this guy, set him in the windows of a dark room, and call the cops. God knows they need some useful stuff to do at night besides drink coffee and play video games. Would get more stars, but he's damn expensive

the box it came in looked like it had been torn apart by a pack of wild dogs when i received it.  fur was falling off of the coat as i pulled it out of the box.  i tried it on just to see if i'd like a replacement since it was not in perfect condition, and it was NOT cute on.  i immediately returned it

This case is actually made for fourth generation models and although it is being advertised as being for the fifth, the case is too big for a snug fit. It works, but I didn't spend this money for something that was advertised as being made for the new Ipod. Real scam

The fabric of the bathrobe was wonderful Egyptian cotton, but the bathrobe was huge.  It was more like a tent than a bathrobe.  It was an anniversary present for my wife (size 8) and the bathrobe was one size fits all as long as you wear a size 18.  I was very disappointed that I could not have ordered at least a general size (large, medium or small)

The phrase "more efficient sourcing" means that Lands End is now buying these in China. The pants arrived with a strange smell (fishy odor), the fit was odd, and, after one washing, the fabric looked bad. They went back ASAP!

I bought khakis from Lands End for over a dozen years until this recent product change. Notice the past tense. Ownership by K-Mart Holdings is definitely making an impact on the company

The cheaper variety at Walmart ($8.92 versus $19 and up), No Boundaries brand, is better for me due to the fact that they are harder and more firm, more like a Birkenstock cork sole which I also find very comfortable, for me anyway. They do last longer too and are not affected by heat in any way.
Walmart also has a real color explosion going on. You can get some really wild color combinations which give the shoe have a little personality for those occasions when you feel the need to express yourself.

So, for the cheaper price Walmart offers, I feel the value and quality exceeds the more expensive brands out there. If you are looking for a firm Birkestock type sole, the No Boundaries brand Croc is a shoe-in, no pun intended.

The fast delivery and reasonable price for these shoes almost make me ignore the not so perfect pair of shoes I received.
They look like some floor model and somewhat tried on with part of the heels on both shoes cut off resembling rejects.
I am sure I will not show them off much when I wear them

Never got to wear this Lingerie at all.

Mailed item back for exchange due to a wrong size recieved but no one got back. Sent several emails to check on item for exchange but in the end got a reply saying that they will credit the amount back to my credit card.

Sent another email to emphasise that I requested for an exchange instead of refund but no one got back...

Very Very bad servic

I received this item as a gift and was disappointed when I pulled it out of the box. It's okay, but not as cute looking as the photo makes it seem. The beads on the hem and chest look nice in the photo, but are rather cheap looking. 
It looks like something I could make myself. Very cheap and plain looking.

Hey! I'm twelve years old and I just want to tell all of you other boys out there that you really need to try these. They feel really nice on the skin and they don't bunch up as easily as boxers and boxer-briefs do. They also give really good support to your penis. They keep it in one place the whole day without the discomfort. Boys, ya'll all seriously need to try these undies out. They're awesome

i ordered 3 of these and the main difference is the amount of fabric at the highest part of the leg.  there should only be a 1/2 inch of fabric, but there is more like 3 inches...yuk!  ; b
has anyone been able to locate the panties that are pictured?  (the ones that we all seem to love and want)?
please email me personally if u have found them!

Like every review before mine, my order was wrong as well. The picture is incorrect and needs to be updated. I waited a long time for these items and was disappointed to find a misleading design....yes it's a real hassle to send them back and wait for a refund. I strongly feel that if Amazon was really concerned with customer satisfaction then they would have taken care of this issue sooner. Is this just another big uncaring corporation? This experience has tainted my shopping experience and leads me to not wanting to shop with Amazon for anything again

My wife has purchased and worn this style for many years; however, the items received were nothing like the picture.  The pictured item was exactly what she wanted, lace waistband AT (not below) her waist and high-cut leg openings; the delivered item was an entirely different style with an entirely different (and unsatisfactory) fit.  She'd opened all the items to check them individually before discovering that items had to be unopened and in the original shipping packaging in order to be accepted for return

The item that is PICTURED is the item that I wanted and ordered. However, the item that is described and that I received (Halfpant), is NOT what is pictured. What is pictured is a hi-cut pant. I did not realize this until I received the order, and was greatly disappointed. I had to send everything back. You are misrepresenting what you are selling by having the incorrect picture of the item. I actually would give this 0 stars, but the computer would not allow that.

This was a poorly made product.  Even when left still on a table, North took about 2 min to locate - something unusable for most people who are out on the run and need to know where North is, NOW.  Also it advertises a thermometer on the packaging, but there wasn't one I could find.  I ended up returning this for a full refund

Based on the prior reviews, I fully expected to like these. Unfortunately, I don't, and won't buy more. They don't stay up. I don't have particularly large or small calves, and don't have that issue with my other athletic socks. Oh, well, buy and learn.

I bought both white and black and they are equally disappointing

I found the wallet to be cheap looking and MUCH smaller than the picture lead me to believe.  To call this a wallet is a gross misrepresentation of the actual product.  This is more of an insert to a wallet, consisting of a few card places and a small zippered pocket.  I wasn't pleased with the purchased, expecting quite a bit more the $14 I spent.  I can go to Target and get a wallet for less that what I paid for this one and it will be a FULL wallet, not a sorry wannabe

These underwear were supposed to be size 34, but I could barely shimmy them up over my legs.  The fit was so tight that I could not wear them, even though all my other underwear is size 34 and fits fine. They are also made of a very thin and flimsy grade of cotton, and the fly does not provide enough overlap to keep everything where it belongs.  If you must try these, buy them at least 2 sizes larger - but you would do better with another product

I've purchased several of these bras in the past from Qvc as their ad states and was surprised to see it so cheap here. Though I was suspicious, I ordered one anyway. Not surprisingly, the cups puckered when I tried it on. Never had this problem with any ordered from QVC. When I inquired about returning it, I was disappointed to find they have a no return policy (though not posted anywhere I could find easily). 

I believe this company sells '2nds' though does not advertise that fact.

I will not purchase from this company again, and I am now leery about purchasing through Amazon in general

I bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old.  Luvable Friend's onsies are awful.  The biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies.  And the velcro doesn't even stick.  They becomes undone and fly loose within minutes.  Also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old. Lastly even the shirt tag stinks. It is this cheap oversized tag that I had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son.  Shame on them for making such a cheap product - shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review!

Like the last reviewer said it's tricky to put on using the little straps that go around your bra...that is a FACT. A front closure bra might help some. Even though I (finally and after a lot of cussing) got the straps around my bra, the garment still gapped underneath the bra on both sides of the back strap, which is right in the middle. That is the only place in the back there is a strap to hold the whole back of the girdle up. 

Then there is one strap under each arm that goes around your bra there. It pulled down on my bra there causing scrunching. There is one strap in front in the middle too, which I don't need to use. 

The directions say to attach the Spanx/straps to the bra and 'step' into the garment. RIGHT!! Much easier said than done.

For it to stay up properly in the back I think it needs straps not only right in the middle, but also to the left and right of the middle, in between that and the under the arm ones. I can't really use mine...A waste of money, I already removed the tags and can't send it back. I have another Spanx that is the same but without the little straps and I can't use that either, as it does creep down in the back. Unless you don't MOVE that is. So altogether I have spent about $150 for Spanx stuff I can't use.

There must be a better way to fasten those straps....maybe sturdy SNAPS or velcro or something, and they should  fasten right to the TOP edge of the garment, as it is they hook half an inch down on the inside and that causes the top edge to tend to roll out and cause bulk there.

Not happy

I found these shoes by searching the women's option for running shoes.  The name may say Unisex, but there is no indication that the sizing is 100% male.  Not even a note stating that a woman should subtract 2 or 3 or 10 sizes from her normal shoe size. 

When the shoes arrived here, they were huge. I tried to return them, but Amazon considers this to be MY fault, and planned to charge back any shipping, promotions and coupons against a possible refund.  I had done very well using a coupon, a sale, a "buy $80 worth of shoes and get $20 off instantly" promotion and Amazon prime, so my "refund" would be less than nothing. 

That's right -- if I return the shoes, I owe money.  Because Amazon made no mention that shoes found in the women's section of the site might be men's shoes instead.  Yeah, that seems fair

I purchased this shirt for my golfer mom for Christmas and had to return it.  I bought an XL because she normally wears a 16, but the shirt was about the right size for me (an 8).  The quality seemed to be fine, but the sizing was very misleading

The leather on these gloves is soft and supple. and they're warm

thats about all that I can say that is good. There were scuffs when I got them. the stitching was ripping (and finished itself off soon after) and the fingers were different lengths on each glove. avoid at all costs.

i bought this dress because i thought it looked so good on the model in the photo, but i should have taken into consideration i couldnt see the front. The boobs on the dress were very weird and pointy, and the ties up the back looked awful. It might be good for someone with a different figure than mine, but i think my boyfriend would have been more amused than aroused if he had seen me in it

   This was my second time ordering a Dickies jacket and being disappointed, I will not do it again. The zipper gets stuck on a flap of material almost everytime I zip or unzip it.
   I contacted Andrew Christian over ninety days ago by e-mail and I was ignored. Today I decided to send him a message through Amazon and found out it was to late. I thought that the time limit was 180 days.
   I like everything else about the jacket, but this problem has cost me a lot of time and frustration, there must be a better brand for my money somewhere out there

Be warned that the business card side is deep enough to hold 50 cards.  I bought this wallet only to hold a few credit cards, my ID and some cash.  Hence, there is a lot of wasted space in my wallet.  From the picture, it looks as though the business card side is just a slot. Whereas, in reality, it is actually a pouch (like most of the other card holders).  Other drawbacks are that there is some filler underneath the leather to make it look smoother (which takes up quite a bit of space), the leather itself is very low quality, and the wallet does not close well even without anything in it.  Furthermore, on the inside of the wallet there is a large white tag stating that it was Made in China.  I mean, China is great and all but if you're on a date and you say "Hey, let me pay for this," and you pull out your credit card and a large white tag protrudes with it saying Made in China, well, you are pretty much a schmuck (I cut mine out with a pair of scissors, but there are still some remnants).  So if you like being low class, by all means, buy this wallet.  I personally don't care about my wallet very much so I am keeping it and going to use it, but I almost returned it.  It is most definitely a solid 2 stars.  Hope this helps

The robe does not fit me. I wanted to return it, got a return item number, got busy, and did not get it in the mail soon enough. They have a strict 30 day return ploicy. Nordstroms does not do this. I could exchange it there.

Sorry I got a job and not time for petty rules. I will go elsewhere next time

I ordered what should be my size and what is my size in all my other lingerie. There's there's zero stretch in this, it was difficult to get the panties over the hips and then the waist is big. Since they're short from crotch to waist anyway, it doesn't much matter.

The top fits better, since you adjust it. The cut is still quite poor and, again, there's no give to the silk so it feels tight across the shoulders. It's one thing for lingerie to be snug in the hips or bust. It's another when the cut is so bad that the shoulders are a problem.

If you're narrow through the hips, shoulders or bust, this combo will probably be a nice fit. If you're curvy, you might want to rethink this. It's a shame since it comes in plus sizes. Maybe I should have ordered up about two sizes but it should have been better made and a truer fit IMO

I had purchased this bra, it was recommended by a fitter, so I tried it on, it felt comfortable enough.  I am a 36 DD, after 3 wearrings all I did was sag, it did not hold it's shape, and I hand wash all my lingerie.  This is the worst bra, and very pricey.  Makes you look  wide, not a very good garment, for me anyway..

TRY THE CHAMPION 1123 for the ultimate support and comfort, great t shirt bra, there is also a racer back by wacoal that is great also.

This one I hated and I had purchased more than one, just wore them till they DIED, and they DIED fast...

I truly  beleive in the BALI bra, VF is good to, after 6 months you have to replace all bras anyway, why spend more than $40.00...

Thanks, hope this helped...

Buying this was a mistake. This bra lifts up exposing half my breats which is visible under a shirt. The straps are not comfortable, it's cuts deep into the shoulders-it should be atleast padded. Def. not what I expected from this product. The material and pattern is the only thing I liked; it has a sexy look to it

I had several of these shipped to my Mum in law's in California for sending to me in France where we work and live. Because of a decent delivery speed, and her thinking they looked OK, I gave them a rating of 5 Stars.

Today, after even having BOILED them in water, hoping for shrinkage, I am sad to say that nothing happened.

They are horrid to wear, I oredered a medium size and the fit is that of XXXXXXXL.

DO NOT BUY THIS HORRORS. I wish I could get my hard earned money back, as now I'm wondering if I was the brunt of a joke in Nightmare Alley.

You've got to be con artist to sell these things

The shawl is very thin, not good quality, I suspect it is not cashmere at all, but some kind of a mixture of cheap wools. The color was supposed to be expresso, not even that promise was fulfilled, it is a much lighter brown. I do not recommend this shawl at all

These shoes are cute but not practical at all. I generally wear high heals 4 inches and even more but these are the most painful shoes I have ever tried on. I ordered these and the peep-toe sling back version. These are really narrow in the two, my foot feels so constricted in there, they totally cut off your circulation. And forget about even trying to walk in these. Very poorly constructed. The peepttoe slings however are great, fit true to size and are comfortable.

Was disappointed with the color of the shoe, because there is a difference between the left and right shoe.

At first i thought the wrong models were packed in the box.
But no, it's the shade of the leather that is different, left shoe is darker than the right shoe.

Being in Singapore, it will be expensive for me to ship back for replacement. (I had the shoe delivered to my Brother-in-law in L.A., who brought it back to Singapore for me

The robe does not fit me. I wanted to return it, got a return item number, got busy, and did not get it in the mail soon enough. They have a strict 30 day return ploicy. Nordstroms does not do this. I could exchange it there.

Sorry I got a job and not time for petty rules. I will go elsewhere next time

I just bought 5 pairs of dickies everyday scrubs (from another online company) and was very disappointed. I picked Dickies because they were cute, cheaper than most, and seemed like they would last. The colors are really nice, but the light pastel colors are almost see-through. I tried them on and was able to see my patterned underpants through the scrubs. The ankles are tapered, not obnoxiously so, but definitely tapered. The medium bottoms have a HUGE amount of extra fabric in the belly. The fabric is rough, and feels like plastic

I have ordered this coat 2 times and returned both coats.  I'm very disappointed.  This is supposed to be a reversible coat.  However, the hem of the black side is too long. Consequently it hangs below the hem of the bronze side when reversed.  And, it does not look good at all.  The company needs to revise this pattern

These were a waste of money.  They were not properly designed to cover ANYTHING, much less my backside, even though I did order what SHOULD have been the right size.  I realize I have a lot to cover, but I ordered a size that was supposed to do the trick.  I've still got a pair in white that I haven't even opened!  And won't!  It would be a waste of energy!

After seeing the photo and reading the other reviews I thought this would be a good buy. I'm not really thrilled about this jacket. It's a flimsy rain jacket and not a stormbreaker. It doesn't have that good quality lining that gives jackets that heavy feel. This is something you can easily find at Walmart on sale for $9.99.

I bought this Speedo because I like its new strechy fabric and the handsome design. The biggest problem is that the 1-inch wide elastic band can not stay flat on my waist after a few uses. I own several Speedo swimming trunks, this one is the worst. If the band can be improved, I will rank it at least 3 stars.

I agree with what others have said about the re-designed Sport Knit Pants. I had been happily buying the tapered-leg cotton sport knit pants for at least a dozen years when Lands End decided to start making them with a wide straight leg instead, presumably because some customers had requested the newer look.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I think most people who are looking for the latest fashion aren't going to suddenly start shopping at Lands End. And it seems to me that if a few customers are requesting a new style, the company should make a new, ADDITIONAL product in that style, rather than re-design a product which, according to Lands End's own descriptions, was a perennial customer favorite.  I returned the new pants and this formerly loyal Lands End customer is now shopping elsewhere

I bought 5 pairs, had to return 1 because the legs were different lengths.  The 4 remaining were much too long--the ends of the pants were under my heels.  I knew they'd shrink, but despite washing them in cold water and drying them on medium or low, they barely reach my ankle bone.  I like my pants longer than that. And they've faded to navy blue, even though I used Woolite for dark laundry.  Nothing else has faded as much as these pants.

Also, they're lighter weight than they used to be.  I used to be able to wear these all winter long in southern New England, and they were warm enough for just about anything.  Now the wind whistles through them.

Sorry, Land's End; I'll try LL Bean next time

I've been buying Land's End Sport Knit Pants for over 15 years (Land's End clothing for much longer).  They've redesigned these COMPLETELY (and are doing this to all of their women's pants).  Don't be fooled into thinking you'll be getting what you used to order.  Also, this resizing / redesigning of women's pants is systemic.  LL Bean is discontinuing their similar Perfect Fit Pants and having all of their pants (knit or otherwise) resized / redesigned.  Here's just a few of their improvements?

Among the changes:  The waist band (height/width) has shrunk from 1.5 inches to 1.0 inches.  It now rolls!  Fun - not!
Next, the waist band circumference has been enlarged from 26 inches (=/- .5 inch) relaxed (when not being worn) to a whopping 28 to 29 inches!  

It was great fun to put on the ones I ordered, and even after washing them, I thought I must have changed bodies overnight.  The waist just hung.....  Dare I put anything in the pockets and they would have slid down.  When I tried walking in them, that's exactly what happened and I was constantly having to pull them back up.  I had to pin the waist to keep them on...

That's not all the changes.....

They've enlarged the bottom legs by FOUR (4) inches!  No more slightly tapered leg.

The front rise has SHRUNK from 12.5 to 11.5.  If I wanted my belly button to show, I'd go pull out a pair of my 70's hip huggers.....

The back rise has INCREASED from 15 to nearly 16 inches. Did my rear suddenly increase in size?  I think not.

They claim it is also a more substantial knit at 7.3 oz.(old was 6.7 oz).  The ones I am returning are LESS substantial - especially if you stretch them and can see through them which you can't with my old ones.

Next, it seems they have also extended the inseam length.  It was 32 inches on the old sport knit pants before washing - about 31.5 after.  The ones I received AFTER BEING WASHED had inseams measuring nearly 33 inches.

Finally, as if I wasn't feeling self conscious enough about my bod, the pants have been narrowed in the hips and thighs.

Do you get the picture?  The waist sags and rolls.  The seat is major baggy.  My belly button shows.  They have to stretch across my hips so there's those stupid horizontal lines where they pull at the crotch.  They are sucked tight to my thighs, then ballon out from my knees to the feet.  They're too long, so you can't even see my feet.

I spent 30 minutes on the phone with a "specialist" at Land's End and she couldn't explain why all the changes.  That's also where I got all of the above NEW specs.  Also, spoke with a specialist at LL Bean and their NEW specs are identical.

I spend so much each year with Land's End that I get a gift and card at Chrismas from them.  So, I'm not a casual purchaser of their product.

BUYER BEWARE AND GET THE NEW SPECS BEFORE YOU BUY A PRODUCT YOU THINK YOU KNOW AND CAN RELY ON. YOU CAN"T.

IF YOU ARE A LAND'S END or LL BEAN CUSTOMER - CALL THEM AND COMPLAIN.  THEY'VE DONE THIS IN THE PAST, THEN HAD TO BRING BACK THE "OLD" VERSION.

SO, IT WASN'T BROKE Land's End was always sold out or back ordered on their sport knit pants) SO WHOSE DIM-BULB IDEA WAS IT TO "FIX" THEM????

I bought this for my husband. We tried it in one car and it kept getting stuck in the lighter socket and the end kept coming off (it wasn't screwed very tightly and couldn't be screwed tighter). In the other car it fit in the socket all right but every couple of minutes you had to adjust the radio station and even then the music came through fuzzy. Also, if you turned the car off it doesn't remember which station it was tuned to. We are going to return it to Amazon, but I'm not sure how as I don't think they have an option for returning it as 'the product just isn't very good!' If you want something cheap and are ok with it not being particularly reliable then this is for you, but for hardcore music lovers, I suggest savinf up and investing in a better product.

I bought this shirt last yr for my husband. It lasted about 6 months. Much pilling (those horrid dots all over the fabric),and seams coming un-done. After about 3 washings, it looked like I had bought it at Goodwill, used. I wouldn't even give it a 1 star rating. Plus, you will get advertisments in your snail mail from this company FOREVER. Their advertisments/photos cater to gay men.Get ready to see some very unusual attire.
Not that there is anything wrong with that. ( Loved that Seinfeld episode

Instead of returning the product,as should have done, I tried different ways to put the gloss and polish on those shoes.
All attempts failed. Very unhappy with product. I have learned

I bought these shoes on a whim from Amazon, and was very disappointed and returned them.  I normally wear size 10M from Adidas, as I do with my Metrum shoes and SuperStar IIs.  Yet with these shoes, size 10M is WAY TOO SMALL, and quite painful.  They were returned...  If you order them, make sure you get a larger/wider size

I got the shoes for a while and I must say it was a total disappointment! The look and heel were ok, so does the GTX XCR. However, there is a major problem: the shoes won't hold your foot! The opens for the shoes lace (the tounge) are too big so the shoes won't hold your foot intact. This is potential big problem if you really want to hike with it since your foot will just have extra fraction due to the insecure of the foot in the shoe. Hate it ever since I put it on. I have total of 3 pairs of GTX hikers now and this one is the one I regret to out money in

Don't get me wrong these are nice high end shoes, however, I was sent an ugly red color instead of the yellow displayed on the products site. Nowhere on the products site was the (red) "Outdoor Plein Air" color shown as a choice

Ok, I don't why this bra is available in any size larger than a B cup, because it just does not provide the needed support for women with a larger bust (I see that is available here in 38 DD, and I shudder to think of anyone built thusly wearing this flimsy thing).  It's comfortable enough to be worn around the house, under jammies, for a little support when just relaxing, but if you are looking for something to hold you in place through the day, this bra won't do it.  The front closure just doesn't allow for any lift or support.  Unless you possess a smaller chest, skip this one

I bought a sweatshirt from them--the tote was a "freebie" and too small for much use anyway.

Customer service was awful. They sent me the wrong size--a man's size, not the woman's I was searching for (and the photo had a woman wearing it!  She must have been an Amazon).  I returned it the next day and they REFUSED to accept the return, saying it looked worn

The shirt was beautiful.  Notice I used the past tense verb "was"?  After hand washing it twice the hem came out, the front tie fell off, and the side of the lace ripped open.  It found a new home in the trash.

I've ordered from this seller before and the dress I recieved from the previously was perfect. While delivered promptly, this dress was not as it was pictured.

The bodice of the dress is barely ruched at all and ends up giving the appearance of being lumpy and ill-fitting. unless i wanted to put several hours into altering it, it's basically too unflattering to wear.

I purchased these sox for my husband who has Parkinson's Disease, and has trouble putting on sox. (The disease has limited his finger dexterity.)  The sox came in a package of six pair.  I opened the package and we tried to get them on his feet.  It was difficult as the sox did not stretch.  At the end of the day I had to help him take them off.  After washing them I found they shrunk so much he could not wear them at all.  I looked into returning them but because they came in a six pack I could not do so.  I ended up giving them to a charity.  This is the only time Amazon has disappointed me.  I decided to only use Amazon for books, not other products.

This my first pair of 100% nylon socks.  The problem I have is that my feet cannot breathe in them.  My socks are wet after a full day wearing them. I guess I'll just have to stay with cotton...I've never had that problem before with cotton/polyester socks. They do stay up above my calf all day long, though.

I bought a pair of these thinking they were only different in upper strap material. The footbed/sole is not cork like true Birks, but some sort of composite (rigid). Birk straps are softer and Birk corkbeds are more cushiony.

I wore them around the house to see if they were comfortable and the footbed became marked - just from an hour or so. Too bad because after that I knew I didn't like them. I tried on a pair of Birk Granada (the style this is based on) and immediately felt the difference. 

While these are about 30%-50% cheaper, I would have rather spent more on the original Birks. I think these won't hold up as long and don't offer the same comfort. Also, you can have real Birks "repaired" so they never really wear out.

**Black version has large "Betula" on side in white

Extremely disappointed in this bag.  It wasn't even heavily loaded, just some folders with papers, keys, phone, make up, wallet.  On the very first use the strap broke before I even got home.  Also, the stitching is coming loose.  Also the strap is not leather.  A big waste of money.

I didn't pay much for these, so I had to give them 2 stars instead of 1 just for the value aspect. Wearing these pants is like putting on a plastic bag. They repel water from the outside just fine, but they also keep it in. They might be fine if you do not exert yourself at all during the time you wear them, but that is hard to do. In a pinch, go for it, otherwise, invest in something better. I certainly would not ever recommend trying to ride a bicycle in them

I purchased one of this bikinis a couple of years ago and it lasted about 4 years before it turned into a transparent suit.I ordered 2 suits through amazon.com, but to my surprise the size 34 that I ordered in reallity is a size 28, which makes it very unconfortable to wear. So becareful when ordering. Look at the manufacturer's sizing list (VERY SMALL LETTERS) to find the right size. By the way, I had to pay to return these items because I did not read the manufaturer's sizing chart.  Not a happy camper

I purchased two of these sports bras based on brand, price, and product description. This is a very uncomfortable bra for runners. The seams chafe and it does not "wick away moisture."  The slow shipping didn't help my opinion either. It is a nice bra for less active endeavors.

First of all, they look cheaper than I thought they would look.  But the most important thing is that they are very uncomfortable across the TOP of my foot.  In other words, the straps at the top rub against the top of my foot, and caused blisters.  I am hoping that if I keep trying to wear them, the "leather" will soften up and become easier to wear

In my case, the boots were not quite true to size and definitely not wide enough. My feet ARE size 14 and EEE width (but some EE made on wide lasts can fit). The boots that I received were marked 14 EE but wouldn't even allow my feet half way in. I wish they fit because they look good, the quality is good, and price unbeatable. However, I lost $8.50 at the UPS when I sent them back

I take no pleasure in this review.  I just received (March 2007) my 3rd pair of Vasque Sundowners. I'd used up my GTX Sundowners (4th pair of Vasque boots) that I've had for about 3 years.  This is the first pair that squeaks.  I like good shoes, and I like taking care of them.  I had always been proud to wear Vasque, but the quality of these is just not that great.  The leather is thinner, and is dimpling, so they even look cheaper.  It's a shame, I wish Red Wing (another brand I`ve enjoyed in the past) had not acquired Vasque. It is the end of a great tradition

Verynice looking however I had to return mine because the plastic separator that keeps your writing from bleeding through to the next checks carbon copy was about a quarter inch too short and did not cover the date on the checks.
It was also a bit on the thin side so even if it did cover the date I'm not so sure it would keep someone who write's a little harder than the norm from getting bleed through writing.
Side note- would be a little nicer looking if the corners were rounded instead of square but would have kept it if the other hadn't been a problem.
The service was excellent from Belt Outlet.
Arrived in a normal amount of time.. Very courteous when I called and explained why I would be returning

The scarf is out of good material and is the size and color stated.  I have two problems with the scarf:
     1.  I thought "sheer" meant sheer.
     2.  I expected the edges to be finished (hemmed)

I purchased this scarf as a Christmas present for my daughter-in-law.  It was so cheap and thin it was mailed to me folded up in a 9 x 12 envelope.  I had to go out at the last minute and purchase a scarf at a department store.  I would have been embarrassed to give her the Pashmina scarf.  It was a wasted of money

The views do not show the belt and buckle. I cannot tell from the photos if the buckle closes in the middle or is offset to the side.

Why does this matter? For me, it's vital information. When I'm backpacking I carry my glasses/camera/pen/notebook in a fanny pack. Of course the backpack waistband buckle is in the middle, over the navel. If the fanny pack buckle is also in the middle then the two buckles interfere with each other.

A few manufacturers are wise to this conflict. They make fanny packs with the buckle closure offset--between the left hip bone and the navel. The two waistband buckles do not interfere with each other.

I won't be considering this product because I cannot discern the photograph

These booties are very cute and soft, but they just slip right off my son's feet.  They do not have a way to secure the 'tongue' part of the bootie when you cinch up the velcro and as soon as baby moves their feet, the 'tongue' part just pulls right out.  Not a good value for the money.

Well I guess the title says most of it. I am not happy with them they turn a dark brown just walking across the yard so I have to put them in the washing machine with bleach A LOT. Then the place where the laces go at the top are all frayed. I've tried to was them by hand with bleach so it wont fry but it dosen't work they look the same as before. But they are comfortable I also like the high arch in them. They are pretty when they fist come out of the box but if you are planing on doing any outdoor actives I wouldn't recommend them

I received my new shoes this afternoon and took a test run. I didn't really buy this a3 for its "functionality" but rather the look. I thought the honey comb and the color combination look kinda cool. However, I DID NOT at all feel being "propelled through every foot", and the so called a3 cushion heels felt very stiff. I even poked it with my hand, oh man it's hard. I also tried jumping up and down to try to feel the bounciness, but all I did feel was my feet stomping hard onto the cement. 
BTW, if your feet are wide and flat like mine, it's going to be very uncomfortable when walking with these shoes.  

*** UPdate *** November 15, 2006
It's been 2 months since I've been wearing these shoes, and I've changed my opinion them. Once you get use to the a3 sequence, they are actually quite comfortable. The honeycombs under the heels do make every step a little bouncier now. Maybe it takes time to soften up the material and make them more flexible

These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!

While the suit fits and looks great, my wife had a problem with the fact that the manufacturer placed a label on the outside of the suit.  It's really the placement that bothered her.  There is a black tag sewn into the middle of the rear seam, which from a distance, looks like one had an accident in their trunks.

Thanks, but no thanks.  These shorts are being returned

These are made of a nice material and good for travelling.  However, the inseam is so short that they make no real sense in wearing.  As soon as I sit, nothing is really being covered.

With a longer inseam, these would be awesome

I've been buying these t-shirts for 20 years without issues.  About 9 months ago, Calvin Klein changed the manufacturer.  These t-shirts are nothing but crap now!  They are short and wide instead of the generous cut they used to be, and they came out of the wash after one washing looking like a wet tissue with loose threads.  The price hasn't gone down.. just the quality.  Please don't get ripped off... do NOT buy these shirts.  Here is another case of American immorality at it's best.  Let's cheapen the product so my pocket gets bigger at the expense of yours

These pants were washed one time, following the washing instructions, they were not put in the dryer, and they shrunk not only around, but lengthwise.  I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and didn't have any problems.  I look forward to your reply

At first glance, you'll think these are great - but the wimpy elastic combined with the slippery fabric makes for panties that are constantly sliding off your butt.

I love the Bears. It's impossible for any Bears fan to not love Walter Payton. With that love I ordered this jersey and it shipped to me from FansEdge. The shipping and billing was very speedy and with little delay I had the jersey delivered to my doorstep. It went downhill from there.

As soon as I opened the package I noticed that the 'GSH' (George S. Halas) initials had been sewn over and was broken. Very disappointing. I called FansEdge and they were great on the phone and sent me another jersey. While waiting for the replacement jersey I wore the defective one. By the time the replacement jersey came the iron-on stripes on the sleeves started to peel off. I figured it was just a defective jersey and opened the replacement one. It was exactly the same way. So either FansEdge received a batch of jerseys that were of poor quality or Reebok is maximizing their profit margins and overpricing a cheaply made jersey with one of the most incredible athletes ever name on it.

After asking and waiting 2 weeks for FansEdge to check their supply of jerseys to see if they were all like this with no reply...I cancelled my order. I am still waiting for a refund. This has been over a month now.

With the poor support of FansEdge and what appears like a poorly made jersey I cannot recommend anyone getting this. If you absolutely want one I recommend buying from a brick and mortar store.

Did not fit well AT ALL.  WAY too big around the ankles - every step I took, the boot would start to fall off.  They were the right size, length wise and all, just way too wide above my ankle.  They were about half as tall as they looked in the photo, which was very disappointing.  I sent the boot back at my own expense the same day.  I would definatly recommend finding a boot you like in the store so you can try it on first, then ordering it off of here for cheaper.

I have worn Jockey panties most of my adult life and witnessed the quality slowly deteriorate over time.  The product went from sturdy cotton with strong stitching to less than paper thin cotton with weak stitching.  Two of the pair in the package were so thin that there were already holes in them!  I shudder to think what shape the panties will be in after a few washings.  Given the cost of panties and other similar products, you'd think the quality would be decent.  However, Jockey isn't the only company out there with a substandard product.  I guess until I can afford to spend substantially more for panties, I'm stuck.  I will only pay sale prices

saw these on sale at Macys, on the rack, no box. figured why not, they felt good. But when I tried them on at home the girlfriend started to laugh quite hard. she said I looked like penguin butt and I have a waddle.  I'm going back to other boxer briefs. Personally I didn't find them comfortable at all, and I like this style, A&amp;F, DKNY, CK, other jockey....i'll stick to those..

I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  

The idea of "Medium" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32" waist.  Is that not "Medium" sized? 

I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  

The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  

Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.

I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like "old men's" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.

I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again.

Within two hours of recieving my complaint the seller refunded my money, without requriing that I ship the product back.  For that I am thankful and appreciative, and can recommend the seller. I have no idea what was up with the product.

As I noted earlier, I just recieved this product and it has the overwhelming smell of petroleum, literally like the smell that comes from an oil truck delivering fuel oil to your home.  I bought this for a child and would never dream of giving it to them.  I am contacting the seller to request a refund.  If I succeed I will note that in the review and increase the star rating

Cute shoes, but extremely uncomfortable.  I am not sure that I will get much wear out of these shoes.  I know my size but I starting to think they sent me the wrong pair.  I am so frustrated with Amazon where shoes are concerned. This is the 3rd pair of shoes I have bought that does not give me a good fit.  I suggest that you buy a 1/2 size larger than you normally wear but you will then probably run the risk of the shoe later becoming too big, it's a catch 22

I was impressed by the look of this bag.  It really looked like it would seal the contents well.  Unfortunately, it did not.  I tried several times, and each time, the contents of the bag were soaked!
Fortunately I tested it out with just some cash for a day at the pool... and only ended up with soggy money.  If I had put my cell phone and watch in the bag, they would have been ruined.
I DON'T RECOMMEND IT

These gloves should really be called "Simulation Leather". They are warm and comfortable but the outer layer is some kind of thin black plastic that looks like leather.

I wouldnt feel comfortable riding a Motorcycle with these, if you hit the pavent with them they'd probably just vaporize.

I was astonished at how flimsy the poncho turned out to be. I mean, at almost $25 invested included shipping, I was expecting better quality. 

Well, it's very thin, made in China, and has plastic snaps. The so-called polyester lining just adds to the heat that's generated. I've owned many ponchos through the years, and the first thing you learn is that a poncho is a terrible design to keep out the elements for more than a short period. The reason involves the way it's cut. What I've learned is that you should buy something with some weight to the fabric so that the wind doesn't lift it up or out and allow the elements inside.

Next, you become hot and start sweating profusely in short time. So, a good lining, or a breathable system is required.

If you're just going to use it for short bursts in the rain, then you can get a cheap $10 nylon or plastic poncho almost anywhere. However, if you camp a lot, or will be out in the elements, you need better. The best poncho I ever owned had a rubberized outer layer and a thin cotton liner. This solves both of the problems I mentioned, because it had the weight to stay down and had the lining to help evaporate the sweat

I wish there were 0 star. Although these sandals are very beautiful but never ever even try to buy them.
After searching a lot for buying a present for my sister's birthday, I found this sandal and I decided to buy. I ordered it on March 9th and after 20 days !! , still I haven't received them !!!!!! I am getting my money back. 
Not only I have wasted my time but also I should rush to find something as a present which is by the way toooooooooooooo late!!!!
Conclusion: These sandals are very beautiful but NEVER fall for them.

I actually sent this bag back immediatley after opening!  I knew it was going to be plastic which was fine with me.  I could use it in the summer at the beach or by the pool.  But, the description said it was trimmed in geniune "pig skin" leather.  When I recieved the bag there was no leather to be found on the bag.  The trim was some type of weird plastic aswell.  It was the cheapest and most fake looking bag I have ever seen!  I couldn't believe that Amazon was selling this product for $200!  I love Amazon and everything they have to offer!  They really shouldn't put there name behind this product anymore.  Any faithful Amazon custom would be shocked and appauled to recieve this on there front step!  I know I was!!!

Poor product.  No strap comes with this case.  Too difficult to get the iPod out for updates, whilst trying to pull out iPod can be dropped.  Front view cover is smeary and scratched.  Buttons are difficult to re-snap.  No need for other voting on this --just a poor product

The fanny pack looks nice but the belt did not adjust to be small enough for my hips.  I am a 5'6" 120 lb. small boned female.  The company offered to exchange it, however did not offer any others with cell phone holder.  Now I will have to pay return shipping plus 4.95 restocking fee to return this item.  I did not see the information to learn of this fee before my purchase and am not happy to learn it now

This is a classic style work boot which used to be a lot more common than now, even appearing in one episode of "Leave It To Beaver" in the late '50s, and on the cover of one of Simon and Garfunkles albums of the late '60s. I've owned several pair of similar boots by other makers, including Red Wing. Some comments which apply to this style in general, (and not just Wolverines): Pros - The wedge sole absorbs a lot of shock making them great for standing/working on concrete, or walking long distances on hard surfaces. Also, the non-agressive tread means that dirt and grass doesn't track into the house after doing chores outside. The moc toe tends to breath through the seams, so feet tend to stay cooler and drier in hot, dry conditions. A great boot for the desert, and apparantly highly esteemed by many construction workers. 
Cons - The wedge sole doesn't offer much traction for serious hiking on steep, loose surfaces (which I've used them for, but for which they really weren't intended). Gravel will roll right out from under them. None of the several brands I have owned were water-resistant at all. Walking through wet grass will lead to wet socks very quickly, as the seams around the toe which allow air and perspiration to escape also allow outside moisture to enter just as easily. We used to say "Your feet get wet two days BEFORE it rains". So, perhaps not the best choice for hiking in the Pacific Northwest.
Specifically, the Wolverines were extemely comfortable right out of the box. They have a better insole than any of my previous boots of this style, a removeable polyurethane contoured cushion which provides good arch support. The color was actually more of a brown clay, rather than what I would call tan. The quality of workmanship appeared to be pretty good, actually better looking stitching than my Red Wings. However I was disappointed in the variable nature of the leather. The leather in most of the boot appeared to be adequately thick, however the leather used in the shaft around the ankles was thinner than I have ever seen in any work boot, thinner even than in many suede sneakers. While my ankles were covered, they didn't feel at all supported or protected.
After considering for a couple of days, I decided to return the boots to the merchant who provided them for Amazon, The Sportsmans Guide. They had provided a return shipping label in the box, so I taped the box closed, applied the label, and took it to the Post Office. I received an email a few days later acknowledging their receipt of the package, and a notice of a credit applied to my account.
So, while I'm not very excited about the particular pair of boots which I received, I do give good marks to Sportsmans Guide for a quick and relatively painless return. 
 I ended up purchasing the Georgia SPR 6" Farm and Ranch boot, with wedge sole, also available through Amazon. For further details, please see my review

I purchased these ear buds to replace those that came with my 80gb ipod expecting them to at least be comfortable.  I can't judge if they are more comfortable or not because they won't stay in my ears long enough to decide.  Even when I'm sitting still on the sofa, they fall out...none of the sizes work for me!!!  If falling out of my ear isn't bad enough, the sound is not even half as good as that produced by the stock ear buds.  Very disappointed!

Extremely dissapointed in the colors I received.  Out of 10, 6 were black, 3 red (2 shades), 1 pink.  I could deal with 6 blacks and 4 different (and I mean different - not all red-toned) colors, but not with what I got.  Useless.

I'm upset beyond words.  Will never buy from this seller again, and will not recommend to anyone I know, unless the seller comes through and fixes this

I had been looking for fingerless gloves to wear while I type-- they keep the office I work at at very cold temperatures.  These gloves seeemed perfect--because many fingerless gloves- don't have fingerless thumbs--but these gloves do.  The cost was only 2.99 for a pair of black or navy gloves.  I ordered the black pair.  Well, the knit gloves began to fray on the first wearing- there are many stray strands at the fingers-- they snag easily.  They are warm and I would love them if they did not snag and fray so easily.  But I did only pay 2.99 for them so I guess it's a case of you get what you pay for.

I bought this dress for a trip I'm taking in one week. Should've known better. You get what you pay for, that's for sure. This dress arrived balled up in a USPS bag. It didn't look anything like the picture shown on this site, more like a slip, than a slip dress. And here's the kicker - it was RIPPED! Had two large "snags" on the back of the dress. I'm sending it back and they BETTER not try to charge me shipping. I'm PO'd to the max and who knows if I'll find a dress in time. Grrrr

These shoes are cute but 1) They are made wide 2) the heel is a little bigger than 2" 3) They are uncomfortable to walk in. I think I could find a better pair at Wal-mart if I had to.

The company charged me tax on their shipping charges so they get a BIG TWO THUMBS DOWN for that

These boots were the worst ever!  They were grossly missized and not as depicted.  The back of the boot had a tape with embroidery up it that was mysteriously not pictured when ordering. When returned, the company refused to reimburse shipping even though they acknowledged that this was deceiving. Never again

  These gloves are a little itchy - the profile states that they are fully lined, however the insulation does not extend to the finger openings so you have wool around each finger...some people don't mind the feeling-- personally it drives me nutty.  It's a present, however, so we'll see how he feels about the material.  My main gripe, however, is that the stitchiing is incredibly poor.  Right out of the package, the velcro stiching is coming loose and the velcro is starting to pull up.  The black stiching connecting the leather pads to the glove part is laughable.  It's an "overstich" and most of them look like they'll start to loosen at anytime, causing the leather pad to come off.  There are different colored threads poking out through seams as well.  
  They DO look nice from afar and seem warm (I only tried them on quickly), but for the price...yikes

Shipping was quick.  The shoes are comfortable and stay clean longer.  When soiled they clean up well.  Some wide widths are good but these give just a little more room than most.  The little extra width was more than welcome when on a recent trip I was doing alot of walking &amp; the feet were really swollen. I am pleased with the shoes so far.

These boots are very cute and comfortable. However they are NOT leather as stated in the description. They are clearly labeled ALL MANMADE MATERIALS on the inside of the boot. Since they are now marked down so low they are a good deal, but the price I paid is not worth it for non-leather boots

I purchased what I thought were "deals" from 2 seperate vendors and was very disappointed. 

To get a pair of decent fitting sweats, you have to pay the price, and you won't regret it.

I hope this advice helps

I bought a pair of these Calvin Klein hip briefs at a local retail store last year. I found this pair of underwear to be very tight and uncomfortable. I'm large up front and I found the crotch area to be quite small and thin. The pouch is also to small. I am a briefs man myself, but these are not as comfortable as most briefs. I can say though these briefs are good for wearing under low rise jeans. I would rather wear the Calvin Klein trunks or a pair of boxerbriefs instead of the hip briefs. The trunks are more comfortable for well endowed guys like me. If I had to choose only between these underwears or none at all, I would rather not wear any underwear at all

I loved this bra when I first got it a year ago.  It gave me great support, it looked great and I was the happiest with a bra that I have ever been.  My girls are in the F range so it has been difficult to find the right size.  A year later, the girls are headed south and the bra has no support left in it.  I am really disappointed in the quality after paying almost $70 for one bra.  They are on a great product if it could stand the longevity of time.  One year just doesn't work for me.

I absolutely loved this bra when I first put it on, but after only a couple of washings the metal underwire broke through the fabric and started poking at my underarm.  I thought it was just a rare occurence, but I bought a couple more of these bras and the same thing happened everytime.  They cost way too much money to only get two or three wears out of them.  I am so disappointed in the quality of the underwire

This is a disgraceful garment. I am not kidding when I say that the "sweater" is less than 1 MM thick. The best description that I could give you is tracing paper. It is virtually see-through. When I put it on for the first time, all of the tags ripped off as it is poorly constructed. There is also an obnoxious "Z" on the left chest area. Very tacky. This will be in the very back of my closet until I get around to donating it or throwing it away. Miserable, Miserable purchase.

They are warm and comfortable while they last.


All of the sheep skin inside has fallen out, there is a hole where my big toe is inside the slipper.  The outside of the slipper still looks like new.


It is sort of depressing they only lasted 3-4 months

These slippers are without a doubt the most uncomfortable things I've ever put my feet into. The concept is good, but the shearling lining is so thick that you would definately want to order the next size larger. That might solve the length discomfort, but there still isn't sufficient heighth comfort. They felt like an all encompassing vise, squeezing my feet so tightly that I had to remove them to gain relief. Very uncomfortable.

Really cute boots, but the back zipper made my heels feel as if they weren't supported, and about to slide out.  The 4" heels force your feet into a near ballerina toe pose and I had to take these off after half a day.  My next step is to try some insoles for them and maybe that will help

I had this bag on my wishlist and got it for Christmas.  I wanted it for when I take daytrips to the beach.  I am really disappointed with the size.  It's pretty deep, but not very wide at all.  No way I'll be able to take everything I need to the beach in this bag.  Still, I'll be able to use it for other things

These pants were washed one time, following the washing instructions, they were not put in the dryer, and they shrunk not only around, but lengthwise.  I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and didn't have any problems.  I look forward to your reply

THE COLORS OF BANDANNAS I ORDERED WERE NOT THE COLORS I RECEIVED.  THE INVOICE SENT WITH THE BANDANNAS DID NOT CONFIRM  THE COLORS I ORDERED SO I DID NOT HAVE PROFF THAT SEVERAL ERRORS WERE MADE, BUT I KNOW WHAT I ORDERED.  I WAS CONCERNED AFTER PLACING THE ORDER BECAUSE THE COLORS WERE NOT STATED ON THE CHECKOUT PAGE, BUT SINCE I HAD ORDERED THEM BEFORE, I THOUGHT THERE WOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM

I ordered 16 bandanas at the last minute for my dance team's competition, but I only received 12 in the mail.  The packing slip said 16 and I was charged for the 16.  It was too late for me to order more and the color was too rare for me to find in the stores.  Would have given only 1 star but at least they sent it to me on time.

I purchased the DOPP Money Clip and Card Holder for a specific  Vacation Cruise.  It is nicely constructed but two negatives were exposed: One, It will only hold about six bills and Two, it demagnetized my room Key Card twice over eight days. Realizing this could also demagnetize my regular Credit Cards, I removed them from the Card Holder. I am reluctant to use the Money Clip again.

Even though I favor leather, every once in a while a pleather product comes along that I really appreciate. Well, these boots sadly are not in that category. The pleather started cracking after I wore the boots x3; the lining was poorly cut to begin with and started unraveling. The sad part is that for the amount of money that I spend on these boots, I could have bought a pair of leather ones after x-mas

I ordered this Dress on March 6th. I recevied an email from the company saying that it would ship by March 8th. On March 16th, I receive an email saying that they are out the size I wanted and my order has been canceled. This is unacceptable from a business. I should have been notified by March 9th that the dress had not been shipped. I have less than 24 hours to find a replacement dress. Thanks alot

I was very dissappointed by this item.  It arrived folded into a 6X6 square bag and was very creased when opened.   It will take considerable pressing to try and get it out.  The fabric is too stiff and doesn't drap well. The length isn't long enough to drape over your shoulders and wear as a wrap.  The return policy makes this purchase not worth the risk

Beware, the size is not true size fit
My small turn out to be something that fits like a LARGE from some other brands.
this is not a small, it's loose fitting and it's a straight line cut. it's really BAD.it's so disappointing.
everything doesnt holds in places, it doesnt look like the photo at all.
the materials is nice but the fittting is beyond horrid.
Dont buy this dress unless you are really curvy, and if you are a medium, you need a SMALL for this dress, and it will still fit loosly on you. that's how big of a dress this is.
I'm returning it

size 9.5 fit like it was an 8. I wear a 9 typically and could barely get my foot in, and was unable to walk in them at all without pain. I've bought Steve Madden before many times and know they run slightly small, but this pair was ridiculously small and I suspect perhaps mis-labeled

I acutally saw this shoe on a young lady who matched them so well with her outfit.  I even complimented her on them.  I liked so much how they looked on her that I took the time to locate them online (Amazon).  I ordered them with much anticipation that I would also look cute in them.  Needless to say, looks ARE deceiving.  Perhaps, they felt better on her than they did on me but I felt like I was squeezing my feet into a pair of hard plastic.  I was disappointed.  If there's nothing I've learned being a woman in her mid-30s, I come to realize that there's nothing like a cute but comfortable pair of shoes..

These shoes are not as cute as they appear, the heel is really 2.5", the material is cheap, the fit is too wide, the shoes are uncomfortable to walk in, etc. etc. etc.

On a positive note, it's the type of shoes that can be worn with a pair of jeans or a cocktail dress. 

Be warned, the company claims that all their shoes have 2" heels when they don't and they charge tax on shipping charges..

The footbed on these clogs is very comfortable, but buyer beware - the buckles are attached with staples through the suede and come undone very easily (in my case, after two wearings) The seller's return policy is such that once the shoes have been worn outside, they won't take them back.  I had to sew the buckles back on.  In my opinion, $100 shoes shouldn't need to be repaired after two wearings.  

The suede is also much darker than the picture - still a pleasant color, but not what I expected when I ordered

the cap is nice and presumably does what it is suppose to do by keeping my hair out of my face. However, the stitching at the seam at the back of the cap began coming apart from the day that I first used it. It hasnt torn completely...yet. Nevertheless, I would think that putting a skull cap on once with my short hair would cause a tear so sooon. I wouldnt suggest this produc

Wow, the headband on this skull cap is cutting off my 
circulation!  It is way too tight for casual wear.  Also, 
the fabric on top is almost as thin as panty-hose, and 
your hair will poke through if you have a buzz-cut like me.  

If you're not an athlete, then don't buy this skull cap.  
It's meant primarily for bald football players to wear
under their helmets

This is a nicly styled jersey that could use a fabric or fabric finish makeover. The plain polyester is rough to the skin requiring the use of an undershirt to prevent chafing. The collar is cut high enough to cut across the base of the neck leaving a nasty burn mark.

A cotton, cotton blend, or silk would have made a better choice of fabric making this an unbeatable jersey for many uses

I bought these shoes and wore them to my first fitting.  By the end of my fitting, my feet were throbbing, red, and pinched.  Literally, my pinky toe was purple.  

I bought my true size, but I still don't think these shoes would've been wearable even with a size larger.  They must just be REALLY narrow

The advertising of this product on your site is kind of deceiving, because it doesn't properly show it. From what I saw on the Amazon site, I thought the wallet will be much bigger.  Amazon doesn't give measurements of the product, and there are not enough pictures of the it. Basicly it isn't worth it to buy a product if I'm not sure of how it looks like.  Now I have a wallet that my husband does not want, and I can do nothing with it.  I feel that I wasted $25.00

I am a 44DD I am having the hardest time finding a good bra...I ordered this one and I am a little dissapointed.  The underwires in the front poke out and make it look like I have these bones sticking straight out of my chest.  Everthing else is ok...no complaints other than the underwire not laying flush with my chest bone

Ordered gray, they shipped black. Since it is from Canada i'm not even going to waste return shipping charges. Minor inconvenience, yet still folks, I ordered Gray! Pants are also NOT new, the tags are ripped and torn, it looks like return or wholesale merchandise. I feel cheated, angry, but mostly just disappointed. For shame people, for....shame....

The color is very pale and not very much not as vivid as the picture. Also, from the picture you think that it is high quality and fine threaded but the threads are large and not so apealing as the picture shows. Good customer support though I couldn't return it because of being a gift

These shoes are very comfortable, look great but I had a terrible problem with the "ruggedness" of these shoes.  I am an avid hiker and climber and bought these shoes for the reasons that Merrill is known for, ruggedness and great outdoor shoes.  After only owning these shoes for a month I noticed that the leather sides were cracking away from the sole.  This happened on both pairs of shoes and soon there was 2 holes in each pair.  The insides ripped from slipping them on and off.  I returned the pair to the store I bought them at and got a new pair.  The same problem happened.  These shoes are very cheap and very expensive.  Do not buy!  They look great but unless you are planning on displaying them only I would stay away from them

These boots look good on the first wear.  I bought the black patent boots and after one, not so wild night, they scuffed and had sveral little tears in the material.  If you need boots for one night, for that perfect outfit, these will suffice.

The elastic in these shoes makes them too uncomfortable to wear. Otherwise, the quality of the lace shoes is good. I'd wear them if the elastic didn't dig into my foot (I have small feet too!)

After six months of little use, the inside heal fell apart on both shoes.  The fabric is made poorly and will cause blisters on your heal once it quickly deteriorates. Do not buy this shoe

IT IS A HORRIBLE ITEM.  IF I COULD HAVE GIVEN THIS HAIRAGAMI A NO STAR RATING, I WOULD HAVE, AND TO THINK I WASTED ALMOST $20 FOR THIS JUNK. IT SNAPS UNEXPECTEDLY ALL THE TIME, AND ALWAYS WHILE YOU ARE TWIRLING THE HAIR.  IT TOTALLY TANGLES THE HAIR. IT IS A NIGHTMARE TO GET OUT OF YOUR CHILD'S HAIR.
MY OLDEST, 12, REALLY WANTED THIS HAIRAGAMI AND WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED.

I realize this isn't an expensive bra, but I expected it to at least FIT! I've never ordered a bra that was sized this crazy! The band was way too big and the cups were way too small. Needless to say I'm returning it. Save your money, ladies!

On top of that, it took almost a month to receive it because it was out of stock. Even though Figleaves displayed the item as IN STOCK. This is the third time Figleaves has done this for Amazon items. I think I'll skip buying from them in the future

We received this product in a clear plastic molded container, however there were no instructions at all, nor was there any label.  We immediately thought, this must not be a new product.  Not knowing exactly how to attach it to the PSP or detach it, one of the clips has broken.  We also have more questions - can the battery inside this charger be replaced? If so, what kind is it?  I think we'll be returning this product

When I got ordered these shoes, I was so excited because the picture looked so nice. Do not be deceived by its looks. I saw it in another store, and I tried it on for fun. The shoe fits poorly, and its actually really ugly. I would definitely not reccomend it to any one

I bought this for the flashlight feature.  You have to press and hold the button in a clumsy way in order to keep the green flashlight on.  Also, the only way to have the clock light up is if you have the alarm on.  The buttons on the front are cheap and don't seem like they'll last very long

You have to wear a thick pair of socks in order for the slipper socks to fit  properly.  They only fit properly for one wearing, stretch all out of shape until you wash and dry.  I have fleece socks from llbean which are wonderful and thought I would try these. "You get what you pay for" applies to this product

I was very surpised at the poor quality of these stockings. I have purchased Leg Avenue before and found them to be excellent, however these were like fifty cent bought off the back of someone's truck brand. As a matter of fact I've bought better fifty cent off the back of the truck stockings!Leg Avenue is now off my list! Of course, if they priced them three for a dollar,now that might be worth the price

These socks are advertised as seamless toe socks. They are very thin and they DO have a very uncomfortable seam in the toe. Not only does the seam press into the toe, but you can feel the inner seam of the shoe itself. Terrible product

I was very disappointed with this bra.  I would definately not recommend it.  If you are looking for a good and supportive nursing bra try the Maternelle bra instead.

This bra looks sexy, but does not offer the support and coverage needed for a nursing bra (at least not for a size 38DD)

Although the description of these booties says they run true to size, they do not! I ordered a full size and a half larger than my daughter's regular shoe size and they were still too small for her to put on her feet. Now I have to pay more shipping for an exchange. Not a great transaction experience

I have the same jacket in black but I bought this from elsewhere. What a rip off it is. It is made in china and the feather keeps on coming and on a given day I had to remove atleast 20- 25 of the feathers since they peek so much. I doubt how long this is going to last as eventually it will be a skinny jacket without the feathers.!!! Do not BUY

When I purchased this, I was under the false impression that the idea of a silicon skin was to provide the unit with some shock protection in the event that it were to get dropped. 

The skin is so thin, that it does nothing but keep a little bit of dust off of the buttons.

The belt clip is made of brittle plastic and broke the second day that I used it.

Don't waste your money, spend the extra bucks to get something that will last a while.

When you buy Natori you expect the best.  But this product just isn't up to their usual high standard.  Most disappointing is the elastic used at the leg and waist openings.  For 20 dollars they should be awesome.  They aren't.

My favorite panty right now is a Nordstrom brand boy short that is really comfortable and costs about 10 bucks.  I haven't seen them online, but this is worth a trip to the store

I have found Gerber brand clothing to be disappointing. The don't stand up to laundering very well, in that they shrink quite a bit. They already seem small for the size on the label, but it gets worse after you wash and dry them (even on the "delicate" cycle). My 6-week old was already wearing onesies and sleepers sized 3-6 months! It's worth spending the extra money for a better brand, such as Carter's

This is an okay jacket. The padding in it is okay. Sizes tend to run a little smaller than normal. There is no liner, and you will get cold riding at night. Overall the jacket has only 2 layers, and if you hold it in front of you you can see through the mesh. Spend a little bit more and get something that will hold up

Although very cute, Crocs are not good shoes.  They are a cheap, plastic shoe that is over priced and NOT comfortable at all.  I bought a pair for my two year old daughter because of the ease to clean them and because they are "non slip".  She did slip in them, many times and the worse part is that they gave her huge terrible red blisters on the side of her feet.  They are the right size but I just think they are not made well.

Don't go for the hype. They are a useless shoe.

I purchased this item thinking that it would make a nice gift, but upon receiving it found it looks and feels like something from a dollar store, and it's not even worth the dollar.  
  Very cheezy item.

Ordered mens 6.5 for my son, shoes are sized a womans 6.5 (say mens 6.5 on box and shoe).  I'm going to have to pay $6.50 to return them for a larger size.  Don't waste your money, Buy NIkes

My review appears to be inconsistent with the others.  Weeks after I received my jacket I had to take it to a seamstress to have stitching repaired in several places.  This is not following heavy use, but wearing the jacket one or two days a week walking to my car and from the car to the office.  In addition, the metal snaps should be replaced with buttons for a better look.  When considering the cost of the jacket, shipping and repairs, I should have to gone to Macys and purchased a nicer jacket.

I just received this dress today. Not only was it cheaply made (there are rhinestones missing, threads, and it doesn't flow smoothly), the top of the dress will have you falling out all over the place if you are in any other position than standing completely straight. Also, the support is badly made. I have a very small bust, but I don't think this would compliment anyone who isn't built like Barbie. Definitely wouldn't recommend. It looks great in the picture, but it's not being modelled on a real person.

I thought I was going to save a few bucks and buy my next Combat Boots from Amazon to get the cheapest price.  The seller was totally fine, however the boots were total crap.  The leather was unbelievably stiff and hard, so I thought I would just use a ton of leather conditioner... about 15 applications and I don't think it made a difference.  I put the boots on to try and "break them in" - lost cause there, but in addition, nearly half the eyelets came right out of the lether, first or second time trying the boots on.  I would have returned the, except I had shined and polished, and oiled the boots so much.  Don't buy, stick with Altama or another Military Issue brand boot.  I am sticking with my Altama pair I have had for 7 years

First of all they didn't sent me the pictured panties, but boyshorts in a weird blueish psychedelic print. Butt-ugly. Second, they are from a flimsy mesh fabric that looks really cheap and declasse. Returned right away. Very disappointing

So I just got my shoes after waiting two long weeks....what a dissapointment. I open the box and immediately I see what appears to be a defect. The inside of the shoe (like on your right foot, the left side, not the right) was covered in little black dots that were smudged all over the grey area, including smudging on the asics logo. This was obviously a manufacturing defect seein it was the same color as the logo which was also smudged. Also, the shoe glue was leaking out the back of the shoe. Poorly done, last time I will ever buy ASICS shoes again

I ordered this nursing bra after looking at several and reading other reviews on this product. I received the product in good condition and in an appropriate time frame. That is where the only star I am giving is coming from.
I am concerned with having a good supportive bra. I have fairly large breasts and do not want to be sagging to my knees in 50 years. This bra is the farthest thing from supportive. I had to cut the straps and re-sew them to make them shorter so I could even where it. The material is soft, but thin and stretchy. I have never ordered a clothing item over the internet before and I will not again

I have been a 34 size for my entire life and this bra fits terrible...the fabric is stiff and so uncomfortable..I could not wait to take it off. Champion should stick to making sports bra...do not buy this bra or you will suffer. Plus, it looks much thinner in the picture..it is really thick...it feels like a maternity bra. UGH

On Sept 17 I ordered a cashmere wrap. I finally got the company's attention when I placed a negative review on this forum. I was told if I removed the review after recieving the item, I would be credited for shipping. The item arrived Oct 16. As of today, November 20, my credit card had not been credited. I emailed the company and was told the credit should appear in four to five days.

OK, I am not overly modest and 95% of the shorts/pants I buy fit when I purchase and XL size.  These shorts are made for anorexic bean poles.  If you have thighs, legs or even a *tiny* bit of junk in the trunk, forget it.  These are designed for 16 year old girls, not men.  Shipping is also super slow

These socks do not fit the sizes specified. The elastic is so tight that you can hardly get them on your feet. I gave them to my 12 yr. old son and they were too tight on him also, I threw them out. This is the first and last time I will buy those socks. The Reebok sneakers are great though

Same as the capezio jazz shoes, Way to small for normal people.  None of the kids(48) could fit into the shoes, in the sizes that where recommended.  All had to go up at least 2-3 sizes larger and almost all needed the wides. Very frustrating.  Makes me want to start my own dance shoe business-not for profit.

Not comfortable.  The "thong" between your toes is too thick and too tight.  If you are looking for toeless, this is not the way to go.  Try DKNY hosiery instead.  Expensive, but worth it for the comfort factor and they are very durable

I wish I could give them -5 stars.
I got these to replace a pair of New Balance 999 that I had for almost 10 years thinking that the quality of shoes that cost around $170 should be really good. I couldn't be more wrong. The lining of these shoes started falling apart a just after 3 month of wearing them and not even every day!!! Stay away at all cost

The other day I excitedly tried this bra on at Walmart.  I couldn't believe I could possibly purchase a strapless bra without going to a specialty store.  

Unfortunately the bra does not appear to be made for those with fuller figures despite its claims.  Depending on the company I am a 38 DD or 34FF.  I tried this bra on in a 38 DD.  I was impressed with the way it molded to me but was unimpressed with the support.  Basically under a shirt I sagged as if I was wearing no bra at all.  That is not the effect I want when I go strapless.  Only Goddess seems to have the ability to create full-figured bras that give the same support in strapless bras that you expect from the strapped variety

I was excited to get my first pair of 992 and was certain that they would be every bit as good as the 991; however, I had many of the same negative experiences other reviewers have had.  The shoe is hard, uncomfortable, and much wider than the 991.  My foot slides around everywhere.  I recomend buying these shoes only if you are buying them for thier looks and then only after trying them on first.  Don't be mistaken by thinking you can just buy a 992 in the same size and width that you wear in a 991

I absolutely agree with Brett A. Warner these replacements feel horrible . They don't have the instant great feeling you got when you put the 991's on. I bought them at a local store which did not take returns. So they just sit in the closet. If you do purchase these make sureyou can return them because you will. I wear a 11 1/2

I have run in a pair of 991s for the last 5 years.  I was disappointed to hear that the 991 was replaced by the 992.  I purchased a pair of 992 hoping for similar comfort and fit.  The 992s are nice to look at, but the similarities stop there.  The fit is horrible even after going down from a D to a B width.  The cushioning I've come to love in the 991 is simiply not there in the 992.  I had a New Balance representative tell me point blank that he wouldn't recommend the 992 for running at all.  What is that old adage?  If it's not broke don't fix it.  Did New Balance even test this shoe before implementing it?  991 lovers beware, this shoe is not for you.  I guess the quest begins for a new running shoe

this is the SMALLEST extra large I have ever bought, my daughter is 125lbs and wears a size 2 dress and it's SUPER tight on her.... this was very disappointing to say the least.... if you normally wear a small in other things, I would suggest you buy the extra large in this. The quality of the material is GREAT that's what made me even give this product a 2..

I purchased the non-premium kit ($9.99) with a Silicone skin case cover and 2 screen protectors (one for each screen), but it is the same case.  The problem is that the silicone skin cover is slippery, twice as slippery as the Nintendo Lite without the cover. We thought that washing them in Dove dish soap would wash away the slipperyness, but that didn't work. After handling the cover, your hands have a slippery residue on them.  The other issue is that the cover is so thin that it is little more than scratch protection, not impact protection.  The screen covers that come with the non-premium kit are ok, I guess, but one of them had 2 defect particles that were raised (trust me, the screen was clean).  

I purchased 2 kits, and I had one screen protector defect and my wife accidentally broke one of the silicone covers hinge straps with little effort.  I do not recommend this product at all

I bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old. Luvable Friend's onsies are awful. The biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies. And the velcro doesn't even stick. They becomes undone and fly loose within minutes. Also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old. Lastly even the shirt tag stinks. It is this cheap oversized tag that I had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son. Shame on them for making such a cheap product - shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review!

While I can't agree with the other reviewer RE the quality of the 560 jeans (it seems excellent to me, having owned six pairs over the last two years, which I wear to work every day), and certainly as men's jeans, I don't think they're "out of style", I do have to say Amazon's price on this item is far, far out-of-line.  You can find these same jeans online elsewhere for $38 (with free or cheap shipping), meaning the cost is nearly $20 less than what Amazon is charging

OUT OF STYLE!

All the girls make fun of me for wearing Levi jeans. They say it is a sure sign of being old and out of style.

The fit, quality, durability, and comfort level do not seem to be as good as they were two decades ago. There is definitely a noticeable difference, and not a positive one.

The price far exceeds the value - OVERPRICED!

These slippers are very comfy and fit true to size.  However, the fabric  part between the toes is not anchored to the solid part of the slipper.  It's sewn to the terry lining covering this solid part and when I walk, the slippers fall off my feet. I will not purchase these slippers again.

This seller fails to state that the snap is in the inner lower corner of each cup which is probably why its so cheap.  When I opened the package and unsnapped the cup the entire snap fell off.  When I emailed Alys's customer service they said only unopened merchandise is returnable.  Needless to say, I don't recommend this bra

I love toeless hosiery, but these are the most uncomfortable pantyhose I have ever worn.  If I'm sitting down at all the backs of my thighs start to itch so horribly, and it gets worse when I stand.  These are awful, I can't stand it.  The only good things I can say are unlike some toeless pantyhose I have worn in the past, the toe thong does not bind, and the lightest color actually is light enough for my skin tone, but it is so not worth the itching.  Also, they run rather large, the material doesn't have nearly enough stretch and they bag around the ankles and knees.  I'm only 5 feet tall but out over 120 lbs. and the smallest size is still too big.  I'll give Hue's a try and I might even spring for the Donna Karan toeless panythose, but I won't get these ones again

I was disappointed when I got the shoes and one of them was made with inferior suede and very thin.I emailed the company I bought them from and requested an exchange/return many times. They never responded and I ended up keeping the shoes as I needed them for work. I would not purchase from this company again.

I purchased a iPod video and the case has scratched up the screen around the outside.  On the inside of the case they've got some ruff edges that will damage you iPod screen.  

If you'd like scratches on your iPod screen then purchase this case, but if you'd like to keep your screen from being scratched then STAY AWAY FROM THIS CASE!

the crocs butter turned out to be a sponge with a light infusion of some sort of oil which you rub on the shoes.  I have used it about three or four times and I don't feel it will last much longer. What there was of it seemed to work well, but it seems rather a waste of money considering the amount of actual use.

I purchased the Crocs Butter thinking it would be something special just for Crocs shoes.  As soon as I opened the package, I noticed the Crocs Butter is just like any other shoe buffer/cleaner with the black sponge.  I already own two shoe buffers, one of which I received free with purchase from a local shoe store.  Needless to say, I returned the Crocs Butter, since it's not worth $4.95, plus $10 shipping, which I was not refunded.  What a crock

I realize anyone admitting to wearing a 3X is in trouble in the conservation of fabric, but this manutacturer must be very generous.   The garment was SO LARGE I could have made two out of the one unit.  This certainly was an error in sizing or I am smaller than I thought.  I hesitate to purchase from this retailer because I can not trust their product sizes and sending stuff is expensive and a hassle

I hate this bra.  The elastic band is NOT soft and rolls up as the day wears on.  Shoulder straps are skinny &amp; inadequate.  Only good thing is that it is low-cut.  I prefer my $12 nursing bras purchased at Wal-Mart.  I only wear this one if those are unavailable or my shirt is low-cut

The mid-size is actually quite large.  Had I to do it over again, I would just get the original size because that would be sufficient.  I like a bit of sun but just not in my eyes!  I found that when wearing it in a boat with the wind at my face as we traveled, it stayed on very well.  That was a concern that I had since many visors flip off in heavy wind currents.  I did get a slight headache from it but not as bad as other visors.  The visor part seems to be a hard plastic with a light cloth material covering.  I chose purple and it is a beautiful shade.  The bows that go around your head are made of some soft comfortable material and they go farther around your head than other standard visors.

These gloves should really be called "Simulation Leather". They are warm and comfortable but the outer layer is some kind of thin black plastic that looks like leather.

I wouldnt feel comfortable riding a Motorcycle with these, if you hit the pavent with them they'd probably just vaporize

As much as seller might like this backpack to be 11" by 8.5" by 6.5", the one I've got is surely not that big (10"x8"x4" at best!), and as a result of this it is totally unsuitable for me since notebooks would absolutely not fit into it (and judging by the size the seller decided to advertise, was it what they were aiming for?). The material is ok, so is the craftsmanship, but the fact that they  lied (yes! l-i-e-d!) about the size just completely spoils the whole deal. A great dissapointment!!! :

I ordered a 11.5EEE size slip-on shoe.  Despite the labelling in the shoes, they felt more like 12.5EE.  In other words, too tight across the arch; and so loose on the heel they wore like flip-flops.  Unfortunately, the only way to truely measure the wearing comfort of shoes is to wear them, which voids the company's product return policy.  Anybody want a worn-once pair of shoes... cheap?

The top was very roughly finished. The end of the blue part that crosses the chest did not stay in place,because the seams on it were very rough, so I had to take the whole part out because it made the top look more crooked than it is supossed to be. The top got COMPLETELY ruined on the first wash, I followed the instructions to a "T" during washing but still the blue on the top ran and I had to throw it away. The skirt is still fine after washing it twice but I would not recommend this outfit to anybody

I love Vanity Fair. Their bras just fit me perfectly. When this bra arrived I quickly found it was not Vanity fair. Not only that, but it was made of the most rough and uncomfortable material. I tried it on in hopes it may fit. It was the most uncomfortable bra I have ever tried on. Not because of size. It was bulky, rough and obviously inexpensively made. The tag said something along the lines of, "Made in Hong Kong.

First time I've ordered a product from Leg Avenue - and it'll probably be my last!  I opened up the package and the pantyhose already had 4 "runs" in one of the legs before I even tried them on.  What a waste of money...and if I would pay to ship them back for another pair then I've already put way too much money into, what should be, an inexpensive product

I thought the price of the glasses was too good to turn down so i decided to go through with the purchase. When i received the product they looked very cheap and poorly made. Throughout the first day i had the glasses they broke in the bag, which was in my pocket. I then tried to fix them and finally realized they could never be fixed.

I got two problems with this here lingeree:
1. That model at the top of the page is sparkin hot, how come it never looks the same on my girlfriend?  EH?  False advertizing if ya ask me.  Their shold be a law that all lingeree models hafta weigh 250 and have a bit of hair on their legs like my woman does. Or a warnin label "Objects inside this lingeree are uglier than they appear."
2.  I paid $14.95 and there aint enough there to blow yer nose on. My suggestion: go for the crotchless OR the bustless OR the fishnet, but all three is just not enough lingeree and too much girlfriend..

My son picked out these shoes for basketball. He liked them at first and gave them time to get broke-in, but the outsides of the shoes had no give. Most shoe will form to your foot, these did not. At the end of third stripe, you could feel a big ridge on the inside of the shoe.We had to buy a different pair of shoes that formed to his foot better. Nice looking shoe, but not the greatest fit

I have been wearing boyshorts for ages, and I gave these ones a try because they were on sale and were really cute. The fit is HORRIBLE!!! The seam down the middle constantly rides up into very uncomfortable places. I mean, the whole point of a boyshort is to not have to pick wedgies! I even bought them a size larger, because some brands tend to fit a little snug

i ordered this product from general_discounters and I have tried for 4 wks. and still I have not gotten a response from them and I havent received my order. As far as the actual cologne, it is nice but order it from that company and you'll not get to smell it because you wont get it. All other potential buyers of this cologne beware of the seller and make sure if its 4 days or more late contact seller

I bought this item because it said "optional belt clip."  The belt clip is only "optional" if you "opt" to leave it on and not use it.  You cannot "opt" to take it off.  I would not call this belt clip "optional."  I would call it "will ruin your new phone case if you attempt to remove it," which is what happened to me mere moments after taking it out of the paper envelope it shipped in

I wish I did not order this one. The picture looks nice but when I got it today, I really got disappointed. When you look at it closer, the wood beads, sequins and the cloth are very cheap looking. I wish they used nicer sequins and glossy beads.

These tighty whiteys are close to being a perfect everyday bikini. However, as another reviewer noted, there is a large seam on the right side which will dig into your hip and will actually leave a dent in your skin. I'm normally a 32 waist and the pairs that I own are for my size, medium 32-34. Streching the band and breaking some of the elastic can slay the wicked seam, but I've also ripped pairs clean in half trying to do this. Maybe buying the next size up would work, but that might mean giving your boys too big of a yard to play in and I like keeping 'em close to home.

Look a little harder if you want an alternative to boxers and bland briefs.  The Elance is poorly made and designed, Jockey is barely evern trying.  Look on the web guys, there are better choices.... Jockey's Elance and the similar department store knockoffs of womens underwear are lame

I am not leaking so I don't need those annoying papery pads, but I would still like a little padded protection, so I was hoping this bra would do the trick.  Well, it served that purpose alright, but it was a pain as far as nursing went.  The clasp was difficult to release with one hand.  The cup could not be completely pushed out of the way during nursing making it annoying for baby and making discretion difficult.  Worst of all, the underwire gave me a rash!  This bra may work for some, but not for me..

I bought this hat for my 4 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She loved it.  The downside: the elastic stretch band on the inside of the hat was so tight that the hat would not sit on her head without popping off.  We would have returned it but it was Christmas morning and my granddaughter was thrilled with the concept of having a cowgirl hat.  We ultimately solved the problem by cutting out the elastic band and the hat now fits just fine!  I guess the elastic band is supposed to make the hat fit various sized heads but it is beyond me how the hat would stay on anyone's head

I have these in black, and while I find them to go with just about every outfit I wear to work, I wish they were just a little (read: quite a lot) less uncomfortable. Firstly, the insole provided doesn't seem to fit the inside of the shoe properly. Almost like it's too wide. My foot is neither narrow nor wide, so this isn't something I typically notice about a shoe. There is an arch, but because of the weirdly shaped insole it doesn't provide any support. The zig zap strap is a really cute feature that I love, but it just adds to the uncomfort of the shoe. You can tighten the strap to keep your foot from sliding around inside, but then it cuts off circulation and leaves painful imprints. If you leave it too loose then you leave your feet pretty unstable. 

All in all, a versatile mary jane with good looks but no comfort

These slippers are anything but comfortable. Besides the sizing being to small, I felt like I was putting my foot into a kid's slipper. The width is way to small to be comfortable on anyone's foot, and the inside material is also anything but comfortable.

It is ironic that you would send this to me.  I can not tell you how excited I was to purchase these slippers.  I had bought everyone in my family UGG slippers for Christmas.  Everyone had cozy slippers but me.....SO instead of paying over $60 I found this pair of Warmbat on amazon.  I researched the brand and thought they may be a good match.  I received the slippers as amazon promised in a timely manner.  The next day the right slipper fell apart the stitching and the bottom of slipper fell off.  I was upset and sewed them, and glued them.  The following week the left slipper fell apart.  I did not want to go thru the process of shipping back the slippers, they were $29.00. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO disappointed.  Please forward to WARMBAT

There was no 'draw string waist' and it didnt fit, complete waste of money. (Yeah I realize they do returns but usually companies send you packages and slips to return merchandise with fast and efficient and there were neither.) Didnt fit actual description was off and 'ships within 24 hours means 24 hours after whatever, point being I didnt get the package for like 3 weeks when I was out of town and didnt have time to return it. Ive bought skirts at a quarter of this price and they were made of much better material and didnt take 3 weeks to get to me.  Just be smart.

This is a piece of garbage. It's cute-looking, and *just barely* will fit *just* your DS and maybe a few games and the cleaning cloth, but as far as any kind of long-term travel functionality, look elsewhere. The charger doesn't fit in there very well, which I don't think is an unreasonable demand for a handheld device carrying case. I was able to squeeze both my DS Lite and the charger in there for awhile, but recently the zipper broke, and I had to split it apart to get to my stuff, and now it's useless. If all you want is something to carry just the DS in, this is a decent option. Otherwise, forget it

I purchased this item for my granddaughter who is 13 for use with her Nintendo DS Lite. The case does not fit at all and I have had to search for a different type of case to fit her game

This carrying case was a terrible purchase.  The zipper broke within hours and the Nintendo DS Lite doesn't really fit into it very well.  I was very disappointed.  My six year old used his own money to buy a G-Pak case, which is a much better case for the Nintendo DS Lite

the product was received on 6/18. When I tried it on I found it to be too large, Utilizing the return form included with the order I completed it and returned the item via UPS on 6/20. I'm still not sure about the return policy! When I hadn't heard from The Uniform Company after about 2 weeks I called them. I was informed that they did in fact receive my return but the size that I needed, Large, was not in stock and it would be 4 to 5 days before it could be shipped. I'm still waiting! When I get the product I can properly review it

I just purchased 5 pairs of the dickies everyday scrubs (from another online company) because they seemed inexpensive, durable, and came in many fun colors. I was sorely disappointed. The colors are pretty, but the material is  crummy. Its rough, flimsy and feels like plastic. The pastel colors (citron, cool mint etc) are almost see-through and definitely show patterned underwear. The tops run quite large (i wear a 6-8 on top and the medium is VERY Roomy, i would definitely get a small if i were to ever order them again).

I ordered a pair of scrubs for a friend to be sent to my P.O. Box but the seller used UPS which won't send packages to P.O. Boxes so I gave an alternate address. I've never recieved the scrubs for my friend. I've sent e-mails inquiring about my order and haven't recieved any word back. I've been cheated out of my money.

These "cover ups" are very thin, a scratchy material not very comfortable to wear in the hot sun.  The colors are pretty, but the size is not really conducive to cute styles and wraps.  They are cheap, good thing because I can't imagine what to use them for.  I'd return them but the postage would cost more than the item.

I was a bit dissapointed , i know its my fault , i didn't pay to much attention to the tag that is not the color they show the one you are ordering, it SHOULD be the same thing you're looking physically the thing you're gonna buy!!!
i saw this beautifull gray/orange stripes, and got GREEN /WHITE STRIPÃS.
its very easy to put a picture of the product!!

Although the dress may seem to fit the ideal dress from the movie, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, the cut of the dress leaves extra fabric right under the area of the bust. This made me look awkward and did not fit well. Don't waste your money on the shipping that you will have to pay for when you return it as I did.

The sweatshirt has a cardboard feeling that does not conform to the body. My husband is 6' 178 pounds, so he does not have a problem finding clothes that fit, but this one looked like a stiff kite on him. 
BE AWARE The items were returned and the vendor took over five weeks after receiving the item back to refund the money, and only after I had filed a complaint with Amazon. Amazon acted quickly to post the credit

First, let me say that I was VERY impressed with the shipping speed of this hat, which was nice because I bought this as a last-minute gift. Though, with that said, there is a BIG difference between straw and straw-paper. This hat is straw-paper. I'm afraid to see what will happen once this hat gets wet from sweat or rain. I really think Amazon should improve this hat's description

I guess that I cannot properly review this item, I never received it. This is the second time that I ordered from this same company, Anderson Christian, with almost the same results. The company billed my credit card upon ordering, and then sent one e-mail saying that the items that I ordered are on back order. I eventually cancelled the order. Due to the fact that I live overseas at the moment, I order a lot of things online. I will not be ordering from this company again.

If your loved one is a beautiful 5'7", 130 lb slender lady like mine, forget about this piece of clothing. If, however, she is a 5'1" 180 lb gorgeous "petite" girl, this might just be the excitement inducer you are looking for. You'll have lots of fun, first trying to put it on her, then trying to use the slits which are in all the wrong places, and then finally to remove it from her body without injuring her or yourself.

Fun that will come after that is purely optional..

The little knobs in the sole of the sandals started breaking off soon after I got the sandals.  I have had these sandals before and this didn't happen.  Maybe they redesigned the sole with narrower, and thus more fragile, nubs.  All I know is, they are junk

I bought these shoes to do aerobics in. They look good and are comfortable, but only to walk in. There is zero arch support and when I walk in them I feel as if my feet are flat on the ground. There is zero shock absorption and no cushion for doing aerobics. My old shoes that are 8 months old has triple the cusion of these new ones, but I can't use the old ones. The gym on the base here do not allow dirty shoes. They are 8 months dirty full of sand and dirt. I am really let down over this as it took me three weeks to have them delivered to my remote location. Now I have to look again

Unfortunately, the pockets are small, the fabric is poor quality, the seams already have started to split after wearing it twice.

Overall poor quality.  I would not recommend these scrubs.  I personally will never buy from this company again.

On a more positive note, they did get the right size and shipped promptly

Look, it's on sale! Usually 800.00 now you can get it for only 150.00. And you won't find anyone else wearing this original. Make your drunken friends dizzy with envy. Spill anything on this shirt, it has already has every color in it and no one will notice the spill. Worth every penny. As a bonus, you can also wear this shirt while hunting.

I agree with the other review.  I love the tag-free feeling, but that was about all I liked about this bra.

The fabric seems really cheap.  After maybe 6 washings, my Barely There CC Tagfree was feeling flimsy, and the fabric on the outside of the cups started to pill.  For what they charge for even basic bras these days, I definitely expect them to stay in decent shape for longer than a couple months!  I would not buy another one of these unless they significantly improved the fabric.

The color that I received and the color that was online was not the same.  I shipped it back.  Had to pay for the shipping and handling and insurance myself.  Tried to resolve through Hungry Lion, but they claimed the color was never shown online, when it was.  Hungry Lion did say I would get a refund on the item.  Still have not checked to see if I have received credit yet. Still waiting for my statement.

I bought these slippers because the description specified arch support but in fact the slippers have none.  In the photo, the sole of the slipper appears to have a raised arch area, however, this turns out to be only a styling effect where the sole wraps the upper -- there's no structure under it at all.  The quality of the slipper's upper is lower than expected, it appears to be entirely sythetic despite the description of "wool-blend".  Also, one of the soles was not glued in properly and fell out after I put my foot in the slipper the first time. The rubber sole is substantial, though heavier than I like to wear in a slipper.  All in all, I regret spending the money on these

After I received these, I ordered Dove Apparel, which are more expensive but thicker of material and sturdier of make

I bought this from Motherhood and hated it!!! It is too narrow and so puts a lot of pressure on your hips and pelvic bones, which any pregnant lady knows- our bones are already moving and don't need more help!! The mother ez belt was fabulous though!! I wore it for the last 4 months!!!  Forget about this one though!!!

I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  

The idea of "Medium" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32" waist.  Is that not "Medium" sized? 

I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  

The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  

Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.

I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like "old men's" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.

I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again.

I bought these shoes and they only lasted four months. The leather sole was REALLY slippery and never did make it easy to walk with them on. By the last month i had them, the sole had totally separated from the upper. I thought Florsheim shoes were good; maybe years ago, but not now. These shoes are NOT recommended at all

I love all other Crocs styles, but was very disappointed in the Prima.  They are too slim, and look odd and stretched out on me.  They also tend to slip off in the back as I walk, yet the other styles fit me perfectly.  Great idea, but they should have worked on it more.  I can't wear these outside the house

Ok, for some reason my first review was never posted which only makes me more upset about this bra!  This bra is useless for me.  It has snaps instead of clasp which make it a two handed job to open and close, not so great for public nursing.  And, for someone who is a 34-36 B-C it is amazing to me when the bra slides out of place, the nursing pads fall out and my bed becomes soaked with middle of the night leakage!  All and all I would not recommend this bra

My original order was 1 pair of tennis shoes missing so when I had to re-order the 2nd pair of identical tennis shoes, I was overcharged &amp; also had to pay shipping fees again. I tried several times to resolve this problem via Amazon &amp; the shipping co. Bealls Florida, but was basically ignored &amp; never received my refund. I find this to be deceitful &amp; poor customer service

I was so happy when I found these shoes, they are cute and comfortable, exactly what I was looking for. BUT after about two weeks of wearing them, always with socks or pantyhose, they started to smell terrible. I don't have this problem with any of my other shoes. This was SO disappointing, I will either try to return them or just trash them.

I ordered a pair of the adult designer rain boots from Diane's Little Lambs. I specifically ordered because the boots appeared to accommodate a wider calf (were shorter, fuller, etc). But the boots that arrived were taller, even the color was not the same as 
on the website. I emailed the vendor, never got a reply. So I went to the website to get instructions on mailing the boots back.

The shoe is too narrow and the sides dig into my feet.  The sole of the shoe makes it feel like you are off balance.  I have narrow feet but the structure of this shoe does not lend itself to a comfortable wear at all.

This tie winder is not only twice the size I was expecting, but it doesn't work.  After one attempted use, the lid no longer stays on.  I would have returned it if the return shipping didn't cost more than the item

I got these for christmas in 06 and they looked great on me. Last week I took them to school and I put them in the small pouch of my backpack and at then at the end of the day i took them out at on of the sides had completley snaped in half.There was no way to repair them. These glasses look good but dont waste your money on these. Really cheap. I am very unhappy. =(

Unfortunately the pads made my skin break out and gave me a painful rash.  I think that if they work for you, they would be wonderful, but if you have sensitive skin, they are not for you.  I love the idea. I am a leaky faucet and I would love an easy breast pad that worked.  I am sick of sleeping with my bra on. Hopefully by the time I have my next child, they will come up with something even more breathable

I bought these socks to wear for work.  They didn't even last one day.  By the end of the first day, there was a hole in one of the socks at my heal.  By the end of the week both socks had quarter sized holes at the heels.  I bought three pairs so I tossed out the first pair.

The next week I put on a new pair of socks, and once again by the end of the day there was a quarter sized hole in one of the heels.

I wore these socks once to a wedding; they had a "run" in them within a couple of hours. Admittedly it was an outdoor wedding, involving a longish walk on a dirt road, but it's not as if I was crashing through the underbrush (I was wearing a nice outfit and had no desire to get messed up). Bummer the socks got ruined so fast; they were really pretty :-(

This product is not what it is cracked up to be.  I ordered it, and it doesn't really work too well, i think a button with a piece of elastic would be better.  There is not enough expansion room , its just like not really using anything at all.  Sorry, but i thought the product was not that good.

3. The quality and feel of the cloth was the worst I have ever seen.
4. DONT be deceived by the pictures.
5. The end product is not worth a gift or personal use nor 25% of the actual cost

A sports bra is supposed to keep the jiggling in check when you exercise, but this one doesn't.  Also, the construction leaves something to be desired.  It's very scratchy around the back of the straps and the hooks, where the seams are sewn.  I bought two.  After trying them several times, I gave up and sent them to charity.  Don't bother

I found this bra to be not as supportive as they claim. Still alot of bounce when exercising and the material seem to be to stretchy so the longer it's worn the more it loses shape. The shoulder straps I didn't find had enough support hooks for lift up. I personally wouldn't recommend this bra

Are customers to guess what is a "small" size compared to a "large size?" Is the small for a todder, pre-schooler or teenager? What a waste of time trying to find information on this web-site about the sizes.

I bought this a size smaller than I thought I needed, but maybe I would be happier with it if I had bought it 2 sizes smaller.  I really don't see how the material this is made out of can have any kind of "firm control".  Sure, it's comfortable, but I was expecting some kind of control.  It does smooth out some, but not at all what I was expecting..

In the picture it shows of this bra it looked as if it was low cut and comfortable, but it shows it in a smaller size than the one I wear, so once I opened the box I was very suprised that it was so huge and cumbersome. It could not possibly be worn with a low cut top, which is why I bought it. If you were a size 34d or above, beware

This jacket is soft and almost luxurious.  I am greatly disappointed that when hanging the hoodie by the hood, it split and tore under its own weight!!!!  I think this says it all, no?  I would, unfortunately, not buy and American Apparel item again.  They are usually sized WAY too small and now I see the quality just isn't there.  Greener pastures.....

Perhaps a pediatrist who knows better designed this shoe's insert, but I hated it. It felt half-there. There was good cushion at the back and felt like none at the front - like those "orthotic" deals that come on infomercials. Well, it didn't feel good on my tender forefoot so I sent them back.

On the other hand, the shoe looked great. I guess, if you really want it, shoe can go shopping for some Dr. Scholl's

These would be great boots if you had some way of knowing what size to order.  I emailed Western Chief for a size chart.  I then ordered my son's boots according to the size chart Western Chief sent me.  Once I received the boots I was upset to see that the boots were over 1 inch larger than the size chart showed - this is a big deal for a child's boot.  I then called Western Chief and explained the situation and asked to get an actual measurement of a few other sizes so I could order the correct boots.  I spoke with a Ms. Brewer, who was rather rude, she told me she would have to go to the warehouse to measure the boots and she would call me back.  Of course that was a week ago.  
I luckily found very similar boots at Target - problem solved.
How could a company have a shoe size chart that is so wrong?  The bad customer service was just the cherry on top  :

I love Nine West shoes, but these boots are not made like Nine West.
It didn't help that when I received them they were damaged. I purchased 3 other pairs of Nine West shoes from Amazon and LOVE them but these boots stink!!

This shoe is very comfortable, unfortunately I had to send it back to the manufacturer twice, the second time choosing a different style shoe because the net material comes loose from the seems where the laces are. I am very dissapointed as I have come to expect quality from Merrell and these shoes fall apart in a few weeks.  I would recommend a different shoe as this one will last you between 1 and 3 weeks before ripping

I've owned a pair of 587s for 18 months, wearing them exclusively as walking shoes full-time in the summer and very little the rest of the year. While the shoes are comfortable, I was disappointed at how fast they're falling apart. The padding around the ankle has torn, there are small holes in the top of the toe box from my big toes, and I was surprised to see the description of these shoes on this website to include the statement, "The solid rubber outsole delivers long-wearing durability." That's been my major complaint with these shoes; shortly after I got them, the soles cracked at the heel, and now layers of the soles are peeling off.

I recommend buying another model..

Maybe I'm naive, but I never could figure out how the hooks came out of the keycase. They are spring-loaded, and they turn. A certain combination of push or twist or pull seems necessary to get them out. I got one out by sheer accident but that is it. And there are no directions included. So I'm back to a keyring and that's not so bad.

This is not a jockstrap.  It is a thong and is inappropriate for any sporting activity.  I tried wearing it as regular underwear but found it incredibly uncomfortable, let alone not exactly hygenic!  No surprise that they are phasing them out of their lineup.  Probably the only uncomfortable underwear made by RIPS

The corset looks so pretty... its a pretty material... It can hold you YES... it has a boning made of some crappy material... after wearing it I noticed something was poking Me... both ends the top and the bottom... well when I take a look it looks like the type of thing guys use to fish line. 
It hurted so bad... so I tried to "snip" it with some nail clippers.. they just keep on coming and coming... it totally sucks.. now I cant even use it without thinking of a painful experience

I have owned several pairs of this very boot since 1990; and the first two pairs lasted many years through winter, spring and fall. Each boot used top quality leather and Vibram soles. I actually had the soles replaced on the second pair as they became worn out before the leather upper portion of the boot. Both pairs were very comfortable and durable, with a look all to their own.

My third pair, which was recently purchased, were not of the same quality of the prior pairs of boots. The leather was stiff and upon wearing them the first time the top lacing hook pulled out as I began to snug up the laces. The backer on the riveted lacing hook was defective from the factory. 

Not being satisfied with the quality of the new boots, I sent them back. I did notice the country of manufacture was different on the later pair than the previous pairs. Made in Portugal to made in China... the quality has been degridated and am disappointed in Rockport.

 I bought one pair of shoes and returned them, they were to large. Bought another pair and hoped that I would adjust to the shoe, I haven"t. I have worn the shoes now and can not return them. I plan to give them away to someone they may fit. I will never order shoes again, I learned my lesson.I agree with the other review good quality in the manufacturing poor design as far as the size.I believe rockport made a mistake with the size and fit and thats why they are being sold for a discounted price. I will go to a shoe depatment and try on the shoes before I buy, as I have in the past

I recieved this item yesterday.  Initaly I was very happy, it changed my 8GB black ipod into a green ipod and did a rather good job of it.  The inner skin is a clear white-ish frosted color allowing the original ipod color to show through, I would have preferred an opaque white, but it did not look terribly bad with the green, though blue, red, or any other color than green would have been better with the black I had not the inital foresight to picture this. I was still pretty happy at this point. The hip-clip was removed right away, I have been looking for a nano cover that would allow me to dock to my Logitech MM50 (portable speaker)  without taking it out of the case, eureka, this case did that, without the clip of course.  The lanyard was an added bonus until earlier today I discovered the clips that held the lanyard in place had widened the aperature connections on the iPod nano, so that I would never trust it on the lanyard for fear it would fall off and be lost.  Well, I was still happy with the color change and the ability to sit in my portable speakers without taking it off. Unitl, I discovered a surface scratch on the green coloring of the case. Now, despite the fact that this is the "Aluminum" iSkin Duo, this was not the case at all.  The green metalic colored plastic is painted with an aluminum look.  Okay that was still acceptable, until, I discovered what looked to be a surface layer peeling off, sugesting that eventualy the color would flake away. That was it, that was the broke back camel inducement, and now I am the proud owner of a case that I will never be happy with. At first I had been all excited, and was considering the purchase of other colors, not now, this in my consideration was a waste of money. Hopefully I'll confirm that my ipod can still link to the cradle inspite of the clip damage the lanyard has done.

Very ordinary robe compared to picture and descripton. If plush means thick material this is not. It is low quality thin material with a warning to wash in cold.Any terry robe I have had before was thicker and better made--Sears, J.C. Penney.Does not llook durable

I purchased these for my fiance to wear for our beach wedding in Puerto Rico.  The quality is horrendous, the cut is for MC Hammer not real men, and the company charged me over $22.00 to ship them to me and then told me I wanted them Fed EX.  Not true, the pants were returned, the rest of my order cancelled and I will never purchase anything from this company again

Do not waist your money on this item! It looks so unnatural. The padding is only on the side of the butt cheeks, doesnt cover the whole butt so you can definitly detect the padding. I was so disapointed when I tried it on.

I will be returning this item to the vendor.  I rec'd. this skirt for my daughter and thought it had a colorful embroidery.  Instead I find the word BASKE in a mirrored embroidered image.  Not sure what BASKE stands for.  I guess it's their idea of 'short for Basketball'.  WHATEVER!  You can't see the pic clearly.  I'm out the shipping cost on this one.  What a bummer!

Thinking this jacket was made of fleece like material, i ordered it thinking it was a good buy. When i got it in the mail, a week later, i was soooooooooo disappointed. The material is like paper/ potato sack material... Its awful.. Like plastic...  I dont recommend u waste [...] on this .. The jacket is stylish no doubt... but the material not something u'd actually wear.. So a stylish jacket with bad material describes this jacket best. [...

While I was a little wary of ordering a jacket for $20 online, I went ahead and ordered this one. It seemed like it was made of durable material, and looked snazzy. When it came in the mail today, it was stuffed in a first class envelope with another t-shirt [which I really like!]. I was anxious to see what it was like.

This jacket is /literally/ made of the material used for FedEx envelopes. Sounds cool, huh? The jacket is extremely thin, and feels like you're wearing a paper bag. While I appreciate the prompt service of the people at Andrew Christian, they will probably see my jacket returned within the next couple of weeks

Very disappointing.  This product has less control than an average pair of pantyhose.  The "high waist" was always rolling down.  I wasn't expecting miracles; I just wanted to smooth out my silouette while I lost the final ten pounds of pregnancy weight.  This product was completely useless.  Product has a clever name but that's it.  I really felt like a sucker for spending so much money on this item.  Look elsewhere.

I bought this shoe expecting to wear it as a work shoe on occasion, however, the shape of the shoe is very narrow and it doesn't seem to go with anything including jeans. The comfort level is ok, not spectacular. In reality I don't think this shoe lives up to the Steve Madden name. I can't recommend this shoe

Amazon didn't tell any outright lies about this product but they certainly weren't what I expected.  I was expecting something a bit more durable...the first night I tried to sleep in these, they ripped in the back.  The immitation-satin is so thin that it can barely hold itself together.  But I can't give them 1 star because they are just as cute as they look!

We purchased these boots for my husband who works in the construction field(mainly insulation instalation) which requires him to climb in high places, walk on trusses, and also be under floors sometimes in standing water and other harsh weather conditions. In my opinion these boots DO NOT have "heavy duty" rubber soles at all but cheap soles that start to rub and crumble almost immediately under working conditions. There is also no arch or foot support inside the boot itself. There is a piece of leather saying "Made in China" and that's it. The tag even reccomends getting some sort of insole. The worst part is that on the tag of the boot it states that you should get the next size up than what your normal boot size is. The seller did not state this fact. All in all, if you are purchasing these boots for long term wear or work related activities I DO NOT reccomend them. If they are for a teenager making a fashion statement or for a Halloween costume they're perfect

We ordered this pea coat from Andrew Christian.  The coat- which is double-breasted- had no inside buttons. You have to have inside buttons to hold the coat evenly. I sent it back as defective.  They were very immovable as to refunding shipping costs to me and then back to them- which amounted to $26.23.  They insisted that it was not defective.  I called five other places that had pea coats and they all had inside buttons. Not reliable and not good to work with.

I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  

The idea of "Medium" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32" waist.  Is that not "Medium" sized? 

I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  

The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  

Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.

I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like "old men's" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.

I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again.

I am ex US Army, National Guard and Army Reserve.  I did not expect to receive dress web belts made in China and Taiwan from an Army Navy store.  I have other belts made in USA that are heavier materials (belt and buckle).  The belts have lasted 10 to 12 years and the buckles are still good as new!  I ordered 3 belts with buckles thinking I would not need to buy a new belt for the rest of my life.  The web material is very thin for a belt.  The buckles 2 out of 3 are stamped made in Taiwan and the 3rd has a sticker says made in China.  They are cheaply made and are likely to break or snag clothing.  I will not recommend this product to anybody.  After shipping this junk cost me $47.00 !

I bought this item, and was very disappointed when I received it and tried it on. The mock crocodile leather looks very cheap...the "leather" of the shoe is very hard and I could not wear it for more than 4 hours since it was cutting on the sides of my feet.. After which I threw the shoe in the trash....it was such a waste of money...do not think of buying it..

The iPod Mini Case self is very good from Pacific Design. But Amazon made a mistake to choose eBags as their supplier.

I have ordered one iPod and one iPod Mini cases for my friend's daughters as a Christmas gift. The iPod case was shipped from Amazon directly, as usual, it was nice packed and fast shipping. The other iPod Mini was shipped from eBags. It was bad, bad and bad. I won't order anything from eBags any more. Here is why:

- It was almost one week later than Amazon's shipment.
- It was an open, unpacked or returned item.
- Amazon charges the shipping for that item, even you qualify for the free shipping on your order.

If you don't care about all of these, please go ahead and good luck. I gave 2 stars is because of the product self, otherwise I would give none

It's awful. the S size is too big for me (My waistline is 34 and in the sizing chart it says "size S fits 26-36")so i end up cut it and sew it back so it can fit on me. Then after 3 days of wearing it, the velcro is messed up, it can not attached together anymore. The costumer service is an answering machine (I tried several times to call the costumer service, and only get the machine answer my call). I can not return the item, because it says its illegal to return this kind of item. So my advise, dont buy this item or you'll be sorry.

Judging from the picture, I thought this thing looked like a turban!  It actually has no wrapped fabric, but is a firmly fitting cap.  Hidden in the back is an elastic band that will adjust for larger heads, which is attached to the edges of an ugly looking triangular gap.  Aside from this, the coloring is too bold.  Old Glory will select random coloration for each customer, but my selection has over twice the color variety as the one in the picture!  I don't see how I can wear it without attracting stares

This suit fits like a true Italian size - I ordered a 54 which equals a US 44 approximately. It fit my husband perfectly excaept while the entire suit is cut as a size Regular length and the sizing indicates they are not longs or otherwise, the sleevs ran over 2 inches longer than a regular should, even though the body length was normal for a regular. I think these suits are defects/rejects in which the sleevs were cut too long. So I would not recommend it unless you need a long size in sleeves

This is definitely not something I would want to wear while working out.  Even with mild exercise the lining feels sticky, and the fabric does not appear to breathe.  I'd rather wear cotton jersey pants than this.  For cooler weather, I'd prefer something like a good pair of tights (Sugoi for example)

I love that little white cross on red and normally expect a quality product when I buy them. 
I had this bag for about 2 months of daily use before the two serious failures appeared.
In two locations on the bag the nylon came unstitched: One hole along one of the side panels and the other under the handle. 
It would appear to me that the inside portion of the nylon wasn't properly sealed/Melted together to prevent the material from becoming unwoven. 
The handle came about half-way separated from it before I stopped using it. 

This is a really disappointing thing for me because in the age of globalization, quality always loses to low price and there seems to be fewer and fewer opportunities to buy really quality products without fear that it is crap with a high pricetag. 

I would advise Victorinox to pay attention to quality assurance before people abandon their products as overpriced junk products by a company who has sold out quality for price. 

Some of us are ready and willing to pay a higher price for a quality product.

I ordered this dress and when I received it, I thought that it was very pretty.  When I put the dress on, it was completely see through.  You could see my bandaid on my thigh.  I would not suggest this dress for anyone based soley on the material.
It's a shame because they dress is very flattering and also comfortable.
It would also be impossible to wear anything under this dress (including pasties) because it seemed to show everything

I have white everlast boxing shoes &amp; they are very comfortable &amp; I thought these ones were the same. the difference is that the other ones have soft parts in it where the feet move when boxing. 
 The black ones are uncomfortable in the back side where the division of the shoe is.  They don't move well. 
 plus they charged almost $ 20. for shipping. so I ended up paying a lot for them.

its good to have 8 pairs because somehow the curse of missing socks will hit babies socks too. sometimes they pull them off while takig a walk, at restaraunts, friends' homes, and sometimes the dryer eats them.:

The bought 3 polar fleece caps and they are all one size fits all, but either I have a big head or something becuase it doesn't cover my ears all the way. As for my husband that actually has a small head it fits him fine. So I guess if you have a big head don't get it becuase it will not cover your ears.

I don't own this gear bag, and I'm not going to buy it even though it looks interesting.  Would this be a suitable carry-on bag, or would I have to check it?  I don't know.  The dimensions are not given anywhere.  I want to know more about the products I order

I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  

The idea of "Medium" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32" waist.  Is that not "Medium" sized? 

I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  

The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  

Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.

I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like "old men's" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.

I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again.

I bought this dress in black.  Good news--- it does flatter your postpartum shape.  Bad news--- the pockets for the nursing pads don't go where they should, causing leakage.  Worse, the color black showed milk stains after I leaked.  Definitely not worth the price.  How important is your figure when you're sleeping anyway

A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain. The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank, and the Tigertooth does not. I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe. 

By the way, I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia. The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake. The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking. I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it

I totally didn't have a problem with the seller or anything, great shipping! Um, but, the book kinda rots. If you know how to tie a tie already, then it might be fine, but I don't. The pictures didn't really help, and the wording wasn't concise. One sentence could be interpreted like nine ways!! I practically destroyed one tie, definitely practice with a tie you don't care about or one that doesnt need to be dry-cleaned, cuz they get pretty rumpled.

I bought these slippers for my husband at Christmas time.  I thought if I 
spent $50 on slippers they would last a long time, and be made very well.
I was wrong.  The slippers look good, and the upper leather is very nice
but the sole is a cheap, thin foam.  If you bend it, it snaps.  You would 
expect to find this on a cheap, $2 flip flop.  I was very disappointed.  I bought my husband a cheap $2 pair of suede slippers in Walmart that were just as nice with a thick rubber sole.

If your name were Johnny Damon, maybe.  But you're bagging groceries at the Star Market for $7.25/hour.  Is this jersey really worth a day's pay to you?  The chicks aren't gonna be fooled into thinking you're on the team.  The Sox won't vote you a World Series share.  Your mom's gonna throw it in the dryer and shrink the beejesus out of it, and you're gonna wish you had that money back when your buddy Tommy is selling his old Malibu.

I see from another comment that this shoe was listed as having a real leather upper, which is why I bought it.  I see now that the description has been corrected, but too late for me.

also, the sizing does not run true as the current description states.  I usually wear 9.5, but I have bloody blisters from trying to play in these shoes

I've bought the Predator Absolion TRXFG before and it is a great shoe. However, in this case it is clearly advertised as having a leather upper -- and the pair I received yesterday (blue with red and silver) is synthetic.  Make sure that if you order a leather shoe at the advertised price, you receive a leather shoe! You are not "saving $50" if it's synthetic

You get what you pay for, I guess, but I really don't like these boots. They look fine, and the construction (appearance) seems sound; however they are NOT comfortable. I have had several pairs of Skechers sneakers and expected these boots to be comfortable (at least nearly so). Yet the right boot's footbed is clearly not manufactured correctly, as I can barely go an 8 hour workday wearing them. It feels as though there is a hump under my smaller toes. My foot also seems to pronate markedly. The left boot doesn't seem to suffer from the same defect. They also have very "hard" cushioning...I can't imagine them being worn in a work environment -requiring- boots.

Also I've had the boots less than a month and the laces are starting to fray where they contact the eyelets.

I should probably return them as defective, but the extra shipping fee makes that cost prohibitive

I bought this bra based on a majority of good reviews and blessings from Oprah Winfrey. I am a 38DD and could barley get the bra on. I have always been big busted and struggled to find good support. When I was younger I was trained in classical ballet. I have no problem with range of motion. I still had a hard time getting this bra on. Not to mention, I was falling out all over the place. I am very disappointed with the quality of this bra for the money. I would recommend "Jogbra" or "Chamion" for less money, better fit and better hold if you are big busted.

I'm a 32DD, and while this bra does virtually eliminate bounce, I could get the same results with duct tape. Unflattering shape, uniboob (with the accompanying "interesting sweat" problems) and overpriced.

I really wanted these boots and had been contemplating getting them for almost 6 months.  When they came I was so excited and took them out of the box to look at them and they were stained.  I was extremely disappointed that the product was defective, because I have never had a problem with any Amazon products in the past, I sent it back and I was reimbursed for my purchase.  I am really disappointed I will think twice before I purchase any shoes from Amazon again

I just wanted to let all other bigger busted women know to NOT buy this product. It is made for smaller busted women in mind. There is no support and barely any coverage for bigger busted woman. It was a trial on my part but I hope by writing this it will help other women avoid making the same mistake. Stick with the strapless bras ladies!

We bought this for our teenage son.  The handling of the shipping was prompt, that is the only good thing I can say about the coat.  I will definately agree with a previous posting that the wool seems to be of very poor quality, almost felt-like. The item that looked not so great after taking it out of the box, looked terrible after only a week or so of my son wearing it to school!  I am almost ashamed to send him out of the house in the coat. If it was not so cold, I would tell him to go back to the sweatshirt he was wearing!  The item pills making it look really shabby.  No reports of seams ripped, buttons lost, or holes in the pocket, however, he may be worried that if he tells me about those things I will be upset with him because the coat was just a waste of money.  It was a major clothing item that he had picked out for himself, so imagine his disappointment!  I expected much more of the coat than I got,  and I am looking for a replacement

This corset is not well made at all.  It's made of really cheap plastic boning and the boning sticked out after just a night of wear.  (I wore it to the club one night and by the end of the night the boning sticked through the top.

This was called learning the hard way not to believe the hype and not to buy shoes on line.  The fit was awful, there is no cushioning to speak of in the soles and other than looking good off my feet these shoes are useless

I ended up giving away these shoes after wearing them one day.  We have a recycle area in our apartment building, but it is usually used for things that are not brand new!  These shoes hurt my feet and had no cushioning at all against the concrete I walk on.  I will not buy another pair of shoes on line again, unless I know the make and size from hands on purchase before

Bought these to keep the toes warm will riding my motocycle in the cold weather - worthless - no heat detected - you really feel the bulky wire if you don't put them on exactly right - heavy d-cell draws down the sock on your leg - don't bother, put the extra 25 bucks into your boots
