Cheng,New York City,"Well first off, I'm a guy with very short hair...so I don't know whether or not it really works. But I'm bored and decided to rate it anyway. So here goes:

Cons

Conditioner is really thick and difficult to get out of the bottle. The best solution for this is to let the bottle sit upside down. 

Pros

Smells DAMN good. I'm not a big fan of fruity/coconut aromas, but I like this particular smell so much that I might need to go to rehab sometime in the future. 


Bottom Line: Although this conditioner is difficult to get out of the bottle, it smells really good. Whether or not it will work for your hair, the only way to know is to try it. And even if ot doesn't work for your hair...it's worth the 20 bucks just to open it up and smell it every now and then. =)"

Trama,Southern California,"I used this product this morning for the first time.  I washed my hair, blew it dry, most of the way, then rubbed the product in my hands and lightly distributed it throughout my hair.  The best way for me to describe it, is that, it is like a creamy hairspray.  Yes, it is tacky, like hairspray can be, but that's how it helps you get the style you want.  What I like about how it works on my hair, is that it really tamed the frizzes and brought down the ""big"" hair look that I usually have after blowing my thick hair dry.  I think it would also work well on the days that I blow my hair out.  I would probably blow it out first, then apply some dirt to help tame and smooth it.  I can see where it might make thinner, straighter hair a bit limp, so be careful not to use very much.

Edit:  I think it is best to apply to slightly damp hair, that might help with the people that are having trouble applying it to completely dry hair"

True, it looks about the same as what my hairstylist does, but to me that is well worth the moderately high price tag. It was a good buy for me because I spend a lot of money buying a variety of cremes and glosses to make my hair pretty, and now I know it wasn't the products I put in that made my hair look bad, it was the dryer.I was so surprised to notice that even the ends of my hair were shiny, and my ends are sooo fried.

Great Alternative To The Famous Chi,"May 16, 2005",pandyland,"1""","I had the Chi Turbo (1""), but I got worried after reading some reviews about it being unreliable.  So part of the reason I wanted to buy the T3 iron was that it comes with a 4-YEAR comprehensive warranty.  The other difference is that the solid-ceramic plates are ""infused"" with tourmaline which I found intriguing.

1-3/8"" wide plates are the perfect width for my long-ish hair.  (I've used a 2 inch wide iron, which I found harder to maneuver.)  It heats up fast, and stays hot.  It does a great job gripping the hair without snagging.  My hair stays silky and straight all day, and does not feel damaged after a while, like it did with cheaper irons I've used in the past.

Another thing that this iron does that other irons do not do as well - it really curls.  It has heat vents along the sides of the plates that lets you curl your hair by twisting it near the root and pulling it through (different from the usual method of gripping the ends of the strands and then winding up).  It creates a springy curl better than any flat iron I've used.  (However, the heating vents make the exterior of the iron hotter to the touch.  So there is a drawback to this function.)

Overall, I enjoy using this flat iron.  Very happy with this purchase.

Anyone who is that determined to make the best product on the market, obviously will do whatever it takes to make it happen.
After seeing how much the product was, I cringed at the fact that a bottle of shampoo would be that much. I later, literally dragged myself to Sephora to purchase this shampoo/conditioner after knowing that I was willing to take a risk that could eventually end up in my closet.
I bought it, went straight to my bathroom, and washed my hair. The shampoo did not lather, which I expected considering there is no harsh detergents or sodium lauryl sulfate. The conditioner was a very light, thin substance. Definitely not thick. 
Finale-Dried my hair, and right there, I knew that this product is definitely the BEST hair product BY FAR, that I have ever used. My hair, is very damaged, brittle and FULL of split ends. This product made my hair, very very full, FULL of shine, and very soft. My hair was beautiful for days....
Last test.. going to work. As soon as I put my hair down from a pony tail (I'm a waitress), INSTANTLY everyone noticed my hair. They asked ""what did you do?? your hair is soo beautiful"".. I told them ""40 dollar shampoo and conditioner"" WELL WORTH THE COST. Definitely a salon in a bottle. Now my worst fear is that it will be discontinued for any reason. And if so, I am willing spend 1k to stock up and save as much as I can. There is no other product like it"

Initially the $200 price tag did put me off and I pushed the idea aside. But somehow it remained somewhere in the corner of my mind and one fine day after getting late for a meeting yet again, I decided to bite the bullet and buy the hairdryer. 

And I tell you, I have never been happier using a hair dryer. My hair started looking better and less damaged in the first few weeks itself. It has become smooth and silky and has a healthy glow.  Though the weight and the time taken were almost similar to my old model, the after effect is worth the price paid. The product does come with a 4-year warranty which is an added advantage to justify the exorbitant price. Though the sales brochures uses a lot of scientific terms like ionic mineral and blah... blah...

To be truthful, after putting this in the bath I walked away and came back into the room, wondering who was eating Fruit Loops! That is the scent of this ""fun to take a bath before breakfast"" experience. 

The fresh scent of Lemon and Sweet Wild Orange mingles with Bergamot and Gardenia extract. The result of this bath is a refreshing - I can face the day feeling. If you want to enhance the experience, try the Happy Hippy shower gel with grapefruit. The I Love Juicy Shampoo and Veganese Conditioner also complete the citrus experience. 

If you think the petals in this bath bombs are fun (the ones in my bath slipped right down the drain), wait until you try the Big Blue experience with seaweed. It does take an adventurous spirit to try some of these items, but as an official LUSH addict, I tend to dive into the experiences with abandon. You may also love Golden Slumbers (lavender and Neroli), Sex Bomb (Jasmine, Ylang Ylang, Clary Sage), Romance In A Stone (Wild Orange, Mandarin & Tangarine). 

Onward to try Tisty Toasty which I hear is a bit of a

At the time, it seemed that all the fragrances for men were heavy musks, orientals, spices, etc. This was...er...fruity. (I see you cringing!) It's lemony. Like a puff of lemon cake. A breeze over a lemon field in Tuscany. (are there fields of lemons in Tuscany? I don't know, but it's a mental pic, go with it!) A spritz of cologne following a bit of aftershave balm is a sure recipe to get yourself sniffed and cuddled. It doesn't bash you over the head with macho tones- it lures with tingling tartness. I have yet to meet a woman who dislikes the scent. And yes, I do steal it from my husband sometimes! On him (a light eyed blond) it stays true to the bottle scent, but on me (brunette with oily skin) it morphs to something with vanilla notes in the lemon. I think it's a great ""safe"" gift for people who aren't sure what cologne to buy for a new male friend.
I gave it four stars, because the cologne does need to be reapplied frequently to maintain a viable scent. The fragrance lasts for approximately four hours. But if you can't get noticed for your lemony deliciousness in four hours, you have more problems than a cologne will fix. (brush your teeth!) LAUGH!! :"

This is the tipe of mascara which lengthens the lashes not volumises it (I think Dr. Hauschka doesn't make that kind). When it's time to wash it off it comes off very easy (spares your lashes).

Unfortunately I couldn't change my 4 star recommendation to 2...and this is a follow up on my previous review. 
When I'd been using this mascara for about 2 weeks I noticed that it started to flake except for some reason the flakes ended up in my eyes, not on my cheek or under my eyes. First I didn't know it was the mascara..I thought something went into my eyes but every single time I applied, it happened. Not straight away..but in about 2-3 hours later..This was very frustrating...I tried to put less of this product on my lashes but then I looked like I had nothing on. At this point I still had some flaking, not as bad as before, but it was still enough to hurt my eyes..so I just stopped using this product all together.
The only reason why I'd give 2 stars for this product instead of 1 because it's natural and organic...and I appriciate that fact. But that's about it.
I really wanted to like this product so I am very disappointed, it wasn't cheap either. Dr. Hauschka need to improve the quality of this product"

	While there are five appealing color combinations, all fresh and sheer, my current favorites are Moss and Azure.  With two colors, one light and one dark, I have a veritable palette of possibilities.  Each can be used alone or together with one shading under the brow and the other on the lid.  Or, the colors can be mixed for a completely different effect.

	Colors are intensified by a second or third application.  (A sponge tipped swab is very effective for this.)

It is not cloying or too sweet.  It is a very pure scent and I always feel clean and beautiful while wearing it.  One other thing to note about this product...  I do not always like perfume oils because the scent is not always accurate when compared to other products in the same line.  I am not sure if this is because sometimes the oils are so concentrated that they smell like ""too much"".  The Satsuma oil is not like that at all - it smells true to the rest of the line.  The scent also lasts for a long time after being applied, due to the fact that it is a perfume oil.  A little goes a long way - I would not be surprised if the bottle lasted for over a year.

(Hair) Solid Shampoo Bar by LUSH: Beauty,beauty,2 of 2,4.0,Great shampoo that could be just a little better,"February 27, 2007",J. A. Odell,"Connecticut, USA","My hair tends to fall out due to me not eating enough protein, so NEW! (Hair) is a lifesaver.  As others have said, it lathers like you wouldn't believe -- you really only need to roll it in your hands two or three times to get enough for a thick lather -- and it has an amazing scent.  (Sniffing the bar can actually be a bit addictive...you can smell it really strongly even before you open the box!)  I've found that keeping it in a small lightly covered dish in my bedroom, away from the moisture of the bathroom, is the best way to preserve it for a while.  (Also, it works as an accidental room freshener -- seriously, the smell is incredible!)

My only wish is that the scent would last a little longer in my hair, since it doesn't really stick, even right after showering, unless I use a lot of lather, and that ends up being expensive since then the bar doesn't last as long.  Most of the time, there isn't even much of a hint, whereas other Lush shampoos can make your hair smell wonderful, even a bit overpowering, for days.

Also, unlike some of the other Lush products, it leaves my hair fairly flat.  It's true that it helps with making hair really soft and shiny, but it seems to have the opposite effect when it comes to volume, and that's not so good when you're already having some hair loss.  Using a mostly scent-free conditioner after is almsot necessary, at least in my experience.

I think NEW! (Hair) is a terrific shampoo for its hair-restoring qualities and general sniffability, but at the same time, it could be a little better with its more cosmetic qualities.  Buy it more for the former than the latter if you want the most enjoyment and value out of it.  And if you do have hair loss, trust me -- the price is worth it"

I -love- the smell, and was surprised that other people didn't seem to.  I vastly prefer it to some of the faker, more chemical smells that a lot of shampoos seem to use.

I didn't use it as a leave in, but did the deep conditioning treatment, and afterwards I kept flipping my hair forward over my shoulder, both to smell it and to just feel how amazingly soft it was.  This product left my hair looking healthy, shiny, and gorgeous for days.  I get a fair number of compliments on my hair in general, but after I used this stuff I was getting stopped on the street.  Everyone from the lady at Starbucks to my professor mentioned how beautiful my hair looked.  I highly recommend it.

I have tried a lot of hair products, including some (like Fekkai's glossing cream) made with olive oil, and had better results with Ojon (though I do like a lot of Fekkai products).  Other products I recommend are: Healthy Sexy Hair shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in conditioner, Jonathan Product Anti-Frizz Serum, Origins Happy Ending conditioner, and Fekkai products for curly and straight hair, depending on your mood :)  Products I don't recommend include Suave and Fekkai's Glossing Shampoo (left my hair shiny all right, but frizzy.)

And it is so easy to apply. It comes with a mascara style brush that you simply whisk over your brows to style and keep them where you want them. It stays all day and comes off easily with make up remover.

When I first wrote it, the title was ""I like it"".  Now I've changed it to ""I love it!!!"" because the more I use it, the more sure I am that I will not EVER buy regular mascara again.  This mascara will NOT smudge!  It will not leave ""racoon eyes"" under your lash line.  It goes on where you put it and stays there until you take it off.  It also does not irritate my eyes.  I never thought I would find a mascara that didn't make me want to rub and rub my eyes.  I hate rubbing my eyes because I know it makes them baggy and makes wrinkles.  I have been seeing mascara which forms a tube around the lash advertised in high-end catalogs lately, and have been intrigued.  When I found out Philosophy, a brand I really respect, had this type of mascara available, I had to order it right away.  As soon as the UPS man brought it, I applied it.  It makes your lashes look really long!  They have a lot of individual definition, and show up as very distinct.  This mascara doesn't ""fatten"" the lashes, but it lengthens them so much, and it is a much cleaner look than the lash thickening mascara I have been using.  I really like the look, and the mascara does not smudge, or rinse off easily in water.  It seems to stay on really well, without the clumpy, greasy feeling I get from waterproof mascara.  It comes off neatly in little chunks when you rub a little ""Purity Made Simple"" cleanser on it.  I really like this mascara, and I will buy it again.  Actually I am going to throw out all my other kinds of mascara and only get this kind"

I'm a teenager who has a slight problem with acne, so that's why I bought the Neutrogena Acne Wash instead, which has salicylic acid that will help for acne. 
By itself, the acne wash does not work, but so far with the Clinique, I have not broken out at all! Not a single pimple. Everything is smooth and toned. I love my skin and it GLOWS.
I recommend getting the milder lotion for people with fairer and more sensitive skin, as this is known to peel and cause redness to some.
The salicylic acid is necessary for me and my light breaks-out-during-THAT-time-of-month skin. So if you do not have an acne problem, I think any soap is alright.

I like it better than body butters because it is light and not greasy (unless you use too much), and you can use it on your whole body, not just the drier spots.

Bergamot oil is anti-inflammatory, antiseptic and good for the skin. Christopher Columbus originally brought Bergamot back to Italy from the Canary Islands. Frankincence oil is antiseptic and sedative

Together they are perfect for when you are feeling really stressed out or grumpy and want to relax. Toss this in the tub and you will have a violet fizz that soon turns the water a beautiful silky purple. 

This may be the most beautiful LUSH bath and the essential oils make you feel more grounded. Perfect as a bath before you do your relaxing yoga routine at night before bed. You may want to skip lotion after your bath and try the It's a Pleasure Treasure massage bar which is scented with myrrh. If you enjoy the Bergamot in this product, it is also in Lush The Olive Branch and The Comforter Bubble Bar. Cynthia Sylvia Stout shampoo and Veganese conditioner go well with this experience since they are also citrusy. 

I will agree, this doesn't exactly have a blackberry scent, but it is a beautiful violet colored bath that will impress with its calming and skin healing properties.

I, however, buy it because for the five years or so that I have used this product, I have gotten a LOT of compliments about the firmness of my skin, and since I have started using it my skin has actually become LESS oily than when I first started using it.  

I first purchased this product because of some damage I had done to my skin using a popular acne product.  My skin looked and felt as though I had been burned by acid.  I promptly stopped using that product and purchased this cream along with the cream cleanser because I hoped these products would be soothing.  They definitely were.  Within a matter of weeks my skin started to feel better.  Moreoever, it took on a plump, more youthful appearance (no sagging!).  Within a month or so, my skin was much less oily than it had been.  

Since I first purchased this product I have strayed but have always come back.  In the winter I use the heavier nightcream and have experienced the same results.

The sweet vanilla fragrance is blended with perfumes and the result is something like a spicy vanilla and strawberry milkshake. Can I say yum? 

This is absolutely delish and I think they may have added a little cinnamon to the mix. I love keeping lush soaps by the sink because they don't seem to dry out my hands as much as gel soaps. This one is perfect in combination with the Smitten hand cream. 

Rock Star soap left me dreaming about buying other ""vanilla"" themed items like Think Pink (which I tried), Creamy Candy (a bubble bar), Sympathy for the Skin (which I'm dying to try) and Honey Trap (which I just tossed recklessly into my shopping cart). Candy Fluff sounds like it would go well with this experience. If you love this soaps creamy consistency, Gratuitous Violets, Sultana of Soap and Alkmaar will impress. 

Any chance the vanilla toothpaste will be listed here soon? Wish, wish...

the reviewer who said this only lasts a week must use a TON of soap (though who could blame her with a soap like this?)or take multiple baths/showers a day, because i have used it for a week and it doesn't look any smaller than when i first opened it. it REALLY helps to unwrap soap as soon as you get it so it can air harden before you use it. this helps it last longer."

If this is your first time buying Lush soap online, be forewarned. You will receive a piece that is about 1"" thick and 4-5"" long. In other words, you will be receiving a fairly small piece of soap. If you have a Lush store near you, I strongly recommend that you go and smell the huge chunks of soap they have on display. Once you find a scent you like, buy a Â½ lb brick of it. It will cost a little over $20, but it is worth it if you find a soap you love. I also find that it is easier to experience the full scent of a soap with a bigger slice. I know that Lush stores are few and far between (the closest one to me is about 35 miles away--not that far, but too far to be convenient), but if you can grab a couple of friends and make a road trip out of it, it's an adventure!

Now, on to Rock Star. What a delightful soap. If you are a fan of the Mmmm....Melting Marshmallows bath melt, then you will also enjoy Rock Star. The scent is the same. It is also the same as Snow Fairy Shower Gel and the Creamy Candy bath melt.  I cannot quite place my finger on the scent. The main ingredient in it is Vanilla absolute, but this smells much more sweet and girly.  There is a definite floral scent lurking under the vanilla, but I am at a loss to try and describe it! It sort of smells like warm cotton candy with a hint of brown sugar. It's the closest I can come to trying to describe the scent.

The scent of Rock Star will linger on your skin for the entire day. It's absolutely wonderful. It also leaves your bathroom smelling wonderfully fresh.  Every time my husband uses the upstairs bathroom, he has to come find me and ask what smells so good in our bathroom. It is a fabulously creamy soap and it lathers quite well. If you have white tile in your bathroom, it will leave a pink lather pile on the tile, but it is easy enough to wash off. 

There are a couple of minor downsides to Rock Star. But they are minor: 

1. It melts way too fast. I just wished it lasted a bit longer.

2. It can leave the skin feeling a bit too squeaky clean. When I first started using Rock Star, I thought it would give me dry skin, but that hasn't been the case. It just feels a bit dry after showering. 

Despite these small issues, Rock Star is the perfect soap to make you feel a bit girly and a bit sexy, all at the same time."

I would highly recommend this perfume to any of the ladies out there that are looking for something to drive their man wild, trust me, it works wonders.  

I receive compliments all the time on this perfume and it has a long lasting affect that does not get sour or overpowering as it wears on throughout the day,which most perfumes can do.

I love this perfume, what more can I say............other then I highly recommend it!!!!!!!!!!

A personal tip I would like to suggest is to spray this perfume or any perfume of your choice on your hair, just two quick sprays and the smell lasts much longer then on your skin. Make sure your hair is dry and styled before doing this. "

Sort of tangy and light and sweet. But as with all that Lush does, there is a depth to this scent that makes it interesting enough to enjoy bathing in time and time again.

The tonka oil in it is good for helping you to forgive yourself and for relaxation, according to the first Lush Times catalog it appeared in, so whenever I am having a bad day or kicking myself for making a silly mistake, I bathe in this and feel better. It also has lavender for relaxation and neroli to uplift the spirits.

The only downside to this bomb is that the scent doesn't linger much at all once you get out of the bath, which is disappointing to me since it smells so good! Still, it is a worthy bath bomb and the cheery pink water and uplifting scent make it one I come back to time and time again"

I have had problematic hormonal acne since the age of 21. I'm 27 now. 

After I graduated from the university and started working a real job, the stress went straight to my face (you all know what I am talking about). Unfortunately for me, I am allergic to benzyl peroxide and I have extremely sensitive skin. I also do not do well with tea tree oils and most sulfur and acidic products (basically anything that can kill acne - leaves my face itchy- either swollen like a tomato or is ineffective and I have painful acne bumps...which would you rather do?).

I was a little hesitant after reading the ingredients and noticed that the cleanser had sulfur in it and there was also a jar of pure salicylic acid for blemishes. But, after using other philosophy products for my hair and body - I decided to give it a try. Hell, what's another 50 bucks if it can clear my acne - and if not I can always send it back.

I started using it about 3 weeks ago and my skin has had a tremendous transformation. I finally feel like my acne is under control. I recommend this product fully and it is my duty to tell everyone this after suffering with relentless acne for so many years. 

The cleanser is awesome and needs to be in a larger size. The blemish serum is extremely drying, so if you are sensitive like me read the directions and take it slow - don't reapply throughout the day, until your skin is ready. The day and night face creams are cool. The day one is kind of like glue and seals in the treatment - the entire day! That's why it works, because it is on your face until night time when you wash (I can even faintly smell the product). Then you use your night hydrogen peroxide cream, yes not benzyl. Yeah, this cream is intense as well. So take it slow until your skin is ready. 

One thing that I do recommend is that if you wear make-up, use the purity cleanser (not in the kit) to initially clean your skin and then use the acne cleanser. That's what I do and it works for me - so I will share it with you.

Another thing I do is I will take a little bit of the hope is not enough SPF moisturizer and put on very little on my super dry areas. Remember this acne kit is intense and you may be prone to drying out and peeling - so some oil-free moisturizer can help hydrate the area around the acne.

Well that's about it. I hope this helps you and let's you know that your acne can be tamed and doesn't have to run your life. 

Take care,
M. Rodriguez

I would bathe myself in this fragrance if I could.  And I should.  As noted by the previous reviewer, this fragrance is gone in flash.

This lip gloss is no exception.  These lip glosses come in tubes with wands that have a small lip brush on the end.  The colors are fantastic.  These glosses are all very neutral, and natural looking colors.  None of these glosses are going to make you look too made up; just make you look finished.  The texture is not too tacky or sticky.  And it has a light scent, not very strong and overall its a very good lip gloss.  I highly recommend these lip glosses and will continue to purchase them.  "

I always look for a product that not only puts back moisture into my hair, but something that can fortify it as well to prevent more damage.  I've tried almost every single intensive conditioner in the stores and tried a lot in the salons as well, however this one I came across by accident.

My aunty had gone to a Frederic Fekkai promo sale and bought a WHOLE bunch of stuff.  It didn't really do much for her hair, so she passed them on to me to try.  Some of the stuff I wasn't too impressed with, but this hair mask did wonders for my hair!

After just one use, I could totally tell a difference in the feel and texture of my hair.  Usually, I have to straighten or blow dry my hair when its wet to tame it, however this product I didn't have to do too much after.  I let my hair air dry and just put in a anti-frizz cream after, and that was good.

The mask washes out clean (no greasy residue), so this product is really good for weekly restoration.  But from what it seems like, this hair mask (along with all products, I suppose) work for some people and not for others.  Your best bet is to get your hands on a sample size before you shell out the money for a full tube, since it can be kind of expensive"

My hair is pretty course and frizzy and long, but it is also more kinky curls instead of big, round, ringlets. Well, I let my hair air dry then applied a serum to take care of the frizz. Then I put some in my hair (you don't need much) and scrunched and twisted my hair. It worked wonderfully! My hair was bouncy and had lots of volume and was very shiny and curly, the best i have ever seen it! I got a lot of compliments on it too. The only thing is that if you use too much your hair gets too shiny and looks oily, also it doesnt have much hold at all, so a good hair spray really does the trick with this. Besides that, it is a wonderful curl enhancer"

I've used it for a little over a year now and I won't use anything else.  I don't know the last time I ever had to use an exfoliating scrub because what this does, is an automatic scrub.  It is gradually sloughing off dead skin cells for you and rendering the use of exfoliaters useless. 
I must say, it has a natural funky smell but you do adapt to that very quickly and won't notice it after a while.  You use it once a day for the first two weeks (while your skin gets used to it) and then twice a day thereafter if you want.  I only use it at night and a sunscreen throughout the day because the skin is a little more sensitive to the sun.
Caution - this is an acid cream.  I once had a minor paper cut on my finger (the same that I use to dip into the pot) and I still get tears in my eyes thinking of the pain I was in.  
This is an excellent cream and I strongly recommend it.  It won't get rid of wrinkles (you have to know that there is practically NOTHING on the market that will get rid of them) but it will soften the look of wrinkles and it will give your skin a beautiful softness and glow.  It's an amazing cream with true genuine results"

1. Color is natural and semi-sheer so it looks light-weight, no matter what the shade
2. Colors are not garish - you won't be throwing them out next season.  Not to say that they are boring, just timeless and well thought out.
3. They last a long time.  Not all day, but I really hate those ""all day"" lip colors.  By mid-day, my lips are so dry and gross-flakey.  I've thrown away more of those cruddy ""all day"" lip colors than I care to remember.  Back to the point, my Laura lipstick easily lasts me through a 2-hour presentation to a client.

This is a non toxic device used to heat up the pimples until it get small and dry.
This product is better than Proactiv. 
Proactive does not work on my face instead it irritates and get worst.
Try to wash your face with Dove skin soap for more than 1hr to soften your face and remove the pus. Then, path it dry and use Zeno, and don't over use this product because it might hurt and burn your skin.
Failure to use this product properly might cause 1st Degree burn.

Never use any chemicals on your face while using this product.

For excessive large pimples, I see some people apply a clean duct tape on their face, keep it for 3-8 hrs and remove it.
You would notice that all pus are lying on your face and you just need to clean it using clean water and a skin soap.

The regular price of this product is $150 for 60 Treatment Cycle."

Okay. Think ""Carrie"" on TV's enormously successful ""Sex and the City."" She was the gal who dressed to the nines - always with style and glamour. She brings both of those qualities to her first fragrance, ""Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker."" 

It's a unique, almost indescribable blend of classicism, chic, and innocence. There's not a scent like it with top notes of fresh Mandarin, Bergamot, Lavender, and Apple Martini. Vibrant and warm it's a fragrance that caresses the senses. 

Middles notes are Patchouli, tender Paper Whites, and luxe Orchid. These are enhanced by bottom notes of irresistible white amber, sensuous cedar, and the very sultry musk. This is a scent I revel in, and enjoy wearing. 

The bottle is, of course, simple and exquisite, curved with polished glass, ultra feminine. 

Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker is a beautiful, dreamy yet quite alive fragrance appropriate for every occasion.

Applying your bareminerals foundation first, glues it all on.  The included booklet guides you along. 

Being in my 40's, natural looking is the name of the game for me. No glitter, sparkles, heavy eye liners etc.  This kit accomplished that.  I got brave and tried the ""foiling"" effect and fell in love ! The colors did not migrate, the liner stayed in place for over 12 hours, and I had no eye irritation at all.

Rad ""Sarangels""",CA,"If I had to choose a fragrance that was THE most feminine I've ever smelled, it would be Marc Jacobs.  Yes, it's a gardenia based scent, but definitely not your typical musty, heavy gardenia by any means.  Marc Jacobs is different in that it is a 'wet gardenia', like you're smelling a bunch of gardenias that have been swirling around in a bowl of fresh water.  Intoxicatingly alluring.

The notes of this fragrance are: Gardenia, Wild Muguet, Skin Musk, Cedar, Ginger.  The gardenia in this is faint, but lovely.  It isn't a knock-you-out strong gardenia, but very mellow and mesmerizing.  It'll follow you like a breath of fresh air, and you'll have people sniffing the air you leave behind. :)  If you've ever smelled Michael by Michael Kors, this is DIFFERENT.  Michael is not gardenia, but it is a tuberose scent.  It is very strong, creamy, heavy, and thick.  If you like Michael, you may like Marc Jacobs as your spring/summer alternative.  They're in the same family in terms of florals and such, but different in terms of how they wear.  Marc Jacobs being flowy, and Michael being heavy.  

The 1.7 oz. retails at $65, and the 3.4 oz. at $85.  It's quite expensive, but it does have that brand-name smacked on the front. :)  I think it's worth it.  The lasting power is decent.  Even when you may feel it is gone, it's not, and people will compliment you.

Try it out and see how you like it on your skin"

The cologne is not something you would wear on a daily basis, but would go very well with a suit on a special occasion. 

On the bad side, along with the cologne's elegant odor comes a slightly feminine aroma. While I am not one to prefer a ""musky"" cologne I could do without smelling like a woman. An additional downside would be it's high cost per ounce...

The earthy fragrance may appeal to your wilder side if you enjoy the Jungle conditioner which also contains Vetivert oil. Use this conditioner after the Daddy-O shampoo and all you can imagine you are walking through fields of lavender drinking a coconut milkshake. 

I can also recommend the Honey Trap Lip Balm and the Smitten Hand Cream. ""All that Jas"" is also a wonderful product for the bath.

Cousins,"seattle, wa","when I first got the package delivered to me at work, my assistant and I were smelling all the products... this one made both of us scrunch our noses in distaste. But when I got home and actually applied it to my hair, it smelled nothing like the nasty old lady smell I had detected before. The reason why I have given this product 5 stars, is because I feel that this conditioner has been unfairly graded here. The conditioner is for people with curly or processed hair -- meaning, if you have straight, thick hair, this conditioner may seem like a waste of money due to the amount of product you have to apply. Also, as us girls with curly hair know, not all curly hair is equal. Some have thick, springy curls that gets curlier the shorter the cut it, while others have a thinner quality to their hair which actually gets curlier the longer it gets. I'm the later, and I think this is why this product works for me. I can understand how this may seem misleading to those with the thicker curl types, but I'm here to set the record straight on that one. I hope it helps in deciding if this product is right for you"

This conditioner is absorbed really quickly and doesn't have an overpowering scent. I am not a huge fan of coconut, but this and the shampoo makes my hair smell like a tropical cocktail which I think is really nice. I wouldn't use it every day and don't recommend it unless you have dry hair that needs a bit of extra care. I have used American Cream but I think Coolaulin is better, at least for my hair. I have thick, straight, mid-length hair. Great conditioner to make hair soft but strong, and also shiny"

I had to rummage through my box filled with Lush products ( gift from a thoughtful boyfriend) when I pulled out this huge disc and broke out half while saving the other for one more bath. I didn't even know what this was called but the minute it touched the water, refreshing and invigorating essences of lemons and milky cream escaped my nose, I felt happy in an instant, it was amazing! Even thought my nose refused to recognize scent for days I smelled the oils and citrusy botanicals, the bath water filled with tiny bubbles and I soaked my cold and stress away. 

After the bath I felt great, my skin and bones felt refreshed and I was warm, cozy and felt a lot better. After looking it up online I was really surprised to see that this was called The Happy Pill, because it really did make me happy. I am really looking forward to using the other half, hopefully when I'm not sick anymore. Once again Lush came through for me with the products they so lovingly create and I cannot recommend their bath bombs enough. Whether taken as a fun bath product or to relieve cold or sadness they always work in gentle and relaxing ways.

The main ingredients in this little love ball are good skin nourishers such as Olive oil, Hemp oil, Grapefruit oil, Bergamot oil, Frankincense oil, Lemon oil, Grange Flower Absolute, Mandarin oil, Gardenia Extract ( yum!) and sodium bicarbonate.

Happy Bathing!

This is a large foaming bath treat that looks like a big fizzy orange vitamin pill that you put in water. It seems to foam slowly and eventually I broke it into pieces to help the process along. It kept fizzing and foaming creating tiny orange and yellow islands within the bubbles (I added some bubble bath first - you might want to try some Happy Hippy shower gel). 

Eventually the water turned creamy (olive oil and hemp oil) and this bath reminded me of a creamsicle. Bergamot, orange flower and gardenia also make this a beautiful calming bath that leaves you in a good mood. 

This bath is fun with the Lemslip Buttercream. I keep applying some ""Whoosh"" temple balm to my wrists and happily inhaling deeply. This bath made me feel warm and snuggly and in the mood for lemon meringue pie or lemon sugar cookies or lemon tea. 

This is a good bath for the morning or evening, depending on your mood. I was drinking Celestial Seasonings Tension Tamer Extra with this LUSH experience. If you love ""Happy Hippy"" shower gel, this fun bath product will impress you.

I've tried numerous bubble bath products and these seem to produce an especially fun amount of bubbles. You can literally hide below the bubbles, there are so many. You also get the added benefit of more essential oils. With Lush products, you may have to get a journal just for bath bliss experiences.

The smell usually lingers a lot longer in the bathroom than it does on me. I have a dark blue tub so can't really see if the water changes colour. I think if it does, it can only be a faint pink. It has a strong smell but I think that's part of why I love it so much. The candy flower on top can be pink, blue, yellow, or white.

Mistral, as I was happy to discover, is also the name of a line of bath and body products, all French inspired, all lusciously lovely from scented soaps to soothing lotions to rejuvenating body butters. 

Matthew Tilker, founder and president of Mistral, utilizes Shea butter, which is an efficacious natural healer, in a myriad of must-have forms. Derived from the nuts of the African Shea Tree (according to sacred custom the nuts are harvested primarily by women), this butter is highly emollient, a boon for those with dry skin, chapped lips, any number of skin irritations. 

The pure Shea Butter soap comes in a plethora of inviting fragrances, all milled six times (while others boast being triple milled). South Seas is a particular favorite - it's as fresh as an ocean breeze and as calming, soothing as a tropical island. The marine scent is accented with a touch of grapefruit, white flowers and soft woods. An irresistible combination. 

South Seas is a fragrance with which you wish to surround yourself - made possible by the shower gel, body lotion, massage bath and body oil, bath salts and candle all available at very accessible prices.

Suter,"Portland, OR","I have used Philosophy products for over a year now and am a proponent of their exfoliators and cleansers.  I enthusiastically bought The Present after seeing it as a new product at the Nordstrom counter.

The bottle says that it is clear makeup for fine lines, wrinkles, and uneven texture.  It can be used three different ways; alone as an oil-free moisturizer for sensitive skin; over oil free moisturizer (such as Hope in a Jar) to create the illusion of airbrushed skin; and under foundation for a smooth finish.

I was after that airbrushed skin, and this product works GREAT if used over moisturizer.  It truly does minimize pores and fine lines. If you don't like to wear a lot of makeup, it gives you a very fresh and natural look.  

Unfortunately, no matter how diligent your are, sometimes blemishes pop up and you have to use foundation.  The Present was not suitable in this function for me.  Used under my foundation, my makeup felt cakey, thick, and the foundation did not blend well into this product.  It left unsightly foundation streaks that were difficult to correct.  I could not hold my MAC foundation responsible, because used alone it does not exhibit any of these qualities.

I would highly reccomend this product as ""clear makeup"" but not as a foundation primer as indicated on the back of the bottle.  If you are looking for a foundation primer, I would reccomend Smashbox's Photo Finish.  It is extremely lightweight, blends well with foundation, and the bottle will last forever because you use such small amounts."

I'll often wear it on weekends without any additional makeup.  It smoothes this skin surface.  True - the coverage is not the same as with a tinted foundation - but it offers a lot of improvement worn alone.  Also, I was using a tinted cream makeup base that was not working well on my dry skin.  It would create lines, etc.  So I started combining the two things - the tinted cream base and the Philosophy skin perfector together on a sponge before applying and BINGO - This solved the problem.

I had read about it on the LUSH website and was somewhat skeptical. I was told at the store that Fresh Farmacy would be the better bet for my kind of skin, and I figured the slightly higher pricetag on the FF meant that it was better than Coalface. Now, having used Coalface for the past week, I can say for sure that my skin feels cleaner and tighter with Coalface than it generally has with FF.

I recently received a Fusion razor and loved that, until I went to replace the blades.  $4+ a piece, and they last no longer than any other blade.  So, I got online and researched shaving and what I learned was that, though there have been advances in shaving technology, nothing has been improved, only made more expensive.  I learned my dad was right; all it takes for a great shave is a good safety razor, a decent brush, shaving soap and a mug.

I received my razor a couple of days ago and now, I wake up eager to take a shower and shave.  Nothing has ever cut this close without giving me razor burn.  My skin is sensitive and I have had no problems with that since getting this amazing razor.  It was worth the price, too, because it is the same cost as 4 sets of Fusion replacements.  The replacement blades for this razor are fifty cents a piece and do a far better job.  

I have read reviews for this razor by people who, apparently, weren't trained to shave.  This razor will not cut against the grain.  Also, the handle is weighted, so you have to allow the razor to do all the work, or you run the real risk of filleting your face.  Be patient.  A great shave takes a little more commitment than just breaking out a can of foam and a disposable razor.  Let the razor do the work.  I assure you, even if it takes a few days to get the technique down, you will be thrilled with this razor.

The nicest feature of this amazing razor is that it allows you to adjust the closeness of the blade. I learned that most people like it between one and one and a half.  Mine is set at one and a half and it gives me a perfect shave every time. Until now, I didn't know that such a thing was even possible.  Happy shaving"

Erickson,"Fresno, CA United States","The quality and workmanship is top notch! The price is high for a razor, but it will take you less than a year to break even if you are buying cartriges like the Gillette Fusion at $4 a pop! And it will last you a lifetime.  Replacement blades for the razor run about 50 cents each and last a hole lot longer! I was only getting 4-5 shaves from a Fusion blade, but I can shave my face and head for at least 2-3 weeks on a single safey razor blade :) Even if I changed the blade after every shave it would still cost less than a fusion. 

It takes some getting used to. I got a few minor nicks when I first started using it, but now I never get any.  I even shave my head with it :)  I've had mine for about 6 months and love it.

I suggest starting out on the #1 setting and work your way up. For me right between 1 and 2 is best, any higher and the shave is too close."

The suds in the Lush products are especially sensuous and fun. Baths and Showers have never been as fun as when you use these products. LUSH shampoos and conditioners are above a salon quality and also contain natural ingredients and scents that are beyond deluscious. This shampoo goes a long way so you can use a lot less. 

This shampoo contains seaweed, enzymes for cleaning and essential oils to detoxify your scalp. This product also contains a lovely helping of pineapple, kiwi and mango juice. The peppermint, rose, lavender, almond, rosemary, olive and jojoba oil are especially healing. If there is a more perfect shampoo, I haven't found it. This shampoo is a true dream and contains everything you want for deep cleansing and scalp refreshing.

For softly scented and highly conditioned locks, use this conditioning shampoo and finish off with the American Cream. The entire bathroom will be scented and the fragrance will drift through the house. You will awake the next morning and your hair will still be wonderfully scented with Egyptian musk, honey water, vanilla, sage and lavender.  The conditioner also contains fresh strawberries.

It's a squeezebottle with a brush at the end, and has a twist on lid.  No spills, no mess, no disaster.  Love it!

It is easy to apply with the brush.  I have Lava Flow, which is a shimmery pink.  The shimmer is a more obvious than I would like, as it's big flecks of sparkle, but it isn't so bad that it looks like glitter glue.  There is a strong smell and taste, sorta tropical; although it isn't unpleasant, it is powerful.  Kinda reminds me of red Koolaid.  The color is a bright pink when first applied, but simmers down to a medium pink and is rather sheer.  In the container the color looks unwearable, but in reality it isn't dramatic.  

The only drawback is how sticky it feels.  It is less sticky than Mac's Lipglass, but more so than Urban Decay XXX, if that makes sense.  

I got this as a freebie and I'm glad I got to try it.  I would buy it but in a different color"

It is a cream (much like a moisturizer) that exfoliates and smoothes your lips and makes them fuller/plumper. It also fills in any lines you may have around the mouth so I recommend using it not only on your lips but also outside the lipline. Although I have been using it twice daily for many years, I believe someone using it for the first time should see results fairly quickly. 

Friends of mine who wear lipstick (I don't) also claim if they use it right before they put on lipstick it makes it go on better and last longer. 

(Apparently you can also use this product as an eye cream to smooth crowsfeet around the eyes, but I havent tried this- I prefer Caudelie eye serum and cream.) 

Simply put, I HIGHLY recommend this product and know you'll see results as I have! "

Cousins,"seattle, wa","First of all, it seems a bit silly to defend the smell of any product, as everyone has different oppinions on this. I happen to love the smell, but I am writing this review to talk about what this product actually does; which is transforms hair. I have naturally curly hair, and awhile back I chopped it all off on a hairdresser's suggestion. When my hair was an inch long, it wasn't hard to fight my hair type. Now that I'm in the process of growing it out, my hair has been pretty annoyed at the contant blow drying, dying, and straightening I have subjected it to. Regardless of the cut, my hair has been limp and fried. After using this product along with Big shampoo, my hair has been absolutely transformed. People have commented on my hair ever since I have started using these wonderful products. Now to the issue of price: before using Lush, I was using bumble and bumble wich goes for 20 bucks a pop, as well as various styling products that ran in the similar price range... since using Lush, I have no need for styling products, therefore making these purchases very economical. I can't say enough great things about this brand"
B0002260VO:perfect_conditioning_for_long_or_thick_hair:gensparkie,B0002260VO,Retread Hair Conditioner by LUSH: Beauty,beauty,9 of 9,5.0,Perfect conditioning for long or thick hair,"February 16, 2006",gensparkie,California,"Now let's get its effectiveness out of the way so we can talk about that love it or hate it scent! It is a really thick conditioner and works great every other day or every few days. I have really long hair and this tames it and smoothes my split ends, and it leaves my hair shiny. It isn't greasy at all. 

If you are used to drugstore or salon conditioners, don't judge the effectiveness of any natural conditioner for a month. That is how long it can take for the silicones in mainstream conditioners to leave your hair (silicones are all those things in conditioner that end in ""cone"", like dimethicone, etc). Detoxing your hair off silicones is well worth it though, my hair is much healthier and shinier without that buildup.

So the scent: It is green, kind of melon and fresh, with a hint of violet (like Bathos, Gratuitous Violets, and Daddyo) to it. It took some getting used to, and when I first got it I thought it smelled of green beans or some vegetable-like smell. But when you use it and rinse it out, you are left with a rich green scent, with the tiniest hint of gently floral violet. 

It isn't for everybody, but if you buy it, give it a chance to work its magic in your hair before you make your judgement, because that lovely violetty smell combined with how well it works makes it kind of addictive. I use it with Daddyo shampoo to enhance that hint of violet and the fresh green scent I get from it. I use it in rotation with American Cream which is a bit lighter"

Paying 20 bucks for a conditioner did not quite suit me. However, I have been using it for a month now and I have to say that the reviews were an inadequate discription of the product. Personally, I believe this to be an amazing product. I used it in combination with Big and I believe my hair has never looked better. Retread is a superb conditioner and really does wonders. I have virgin hair, but I do blow dry it ever day so I felt a heavier conditioner was necessary. Since this is a deeper conditioner I would leave it in for 5-10 min or while you do all your other stuff in the shower/bath. My hair was softer than ever afterwards (that could be from Big though) and shined like the sun. This is not an everyday conditioner but works well for once or twice a week (I mainly use it for special occasions, or when I just want to feel pretty!) I highly recommend it and I feel that it works much better than Lush's conditioning treatments. The only issue was the smell. I am not much into the smell of cucumbers and to me that is what it smelled like. However, this could just be a personal attribute as no one else has mentioned this. The product was still amazing though, and I am willing to endure the smell(It fades as the day goes on). My decision about this product is Miracle! Hope this helps!"

My hair was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G after I used it.  After I've read all the reviews about the product, I was still a little skepticle, as I've tried many things that had awesome reviews, but just didn't work with my thick coarse hair.  

I shampooed my hair, put in Retread Hair Conditioner, covered my hair with a plastic cap and set a hot towel over it for an hour (dunking the towel in hot water every 15 minutes to 'reheat' it).  Rinsed out the conditioner and didn't use anything else on my hair (I usually have to put in anti-frizz serum).  

The first thing I noticed was the shine... what a HUGE difference.  Even my boyfriend said there was something different, but he couldn't quite figure it out.  Retread Hair Conditioner left my hair super soft too.  And you don't even need to use that much.

Now for the bad....

the smell (that's why it's not 5 stars)!  I know some people say they love it and some people say they hate it, and I really think that's the way it is... you either hate it or love it.  I actully hated it.  My boyfriend took one whiff (and thought it smelled like old soggy towels) and offered to drive me back to LUSH to return it because he thought it was 'old'.  Another reviewer said it smelled like 'barnyard' and I think that's the best way to describe it.  You do get used to it (and luckly the smell fades as your hair dries), but for me, the smell was too much.  

I will buy again because I absolutely love the results, but I will only use Retread Hair Conditioner when I know I will be home the next day to spare others from the smell"

Okay. Think ""Carrie"" on TV's enormously successful ""Sex and the City."" She was the gal who dressed to the nines - always with style and glamour. She brings both of those qualities to her first fragrance, ""Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker."" 

It's a unique, almost indescribable blend of classicism, chic, and innocence. There's not a scent like it with top notes of fresh Mandarin, Bergamot, Lavender, and Apple Martini. Vibrant and warm it's a fragrance that caresses the senses. 

Middles notes are Patchouli, tender Paper Whites, and luxe Orchid. These are enhanced by bottom notes of irresistible white amber, sensuous cedar, and the very sultry musk. This is a scent I revel in, and enjoy wearing. 

The bottle is, of course, simple and exquisite, curved with polished glass, ultra feminine. 

Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker is a beautiful, dreamy yet quite alive fragrance appropriate for every occasion.

After just one to two uses, you start to notice a sense of calm and order descending upon your formerly sensitive skin. This is especially apparent if you layer the products, first using the cleanser, toner and then the essence and skin creams. If you have oily or combination skin, you may be amazed at how balanced your skin becomes. 

The Skin Essence contains Mulberry that naturally lightens discoloration from sun damage and aging. The antioxidants help to revitalize the skin. This is applied before the cream. Who knew when we were climbing around in mulberry trees staining our fingers and faces as children that one day we would use an extract in a lotion that would heal the skin and lighten our skin. 

Age spots and freckles literally start to disappear or may even slightly whiten more than the surrounding skin so they literally seem to fade away. I noticed this after just a few uses so it is super effective. 

Another reason to use this product is the ""super"" and I mean super fast healing properties. I was amazed. Put this on any skin irritation and watch it disappear in days. 

These products are so fun to use, I've incorporated them into a little night routine for my husband where I give him an antiaging facial before bed. I saw the results of the products on my skin and wanted to share this secret with him. His skin looked instantly more hydrated and he has dry skin. With my combination skin I've seen great results in balancing and clarity. 

The cleansers are like the champagne of skincare and the rest of the line is equally impressive. These are sort of out of my price range if I they didn't last so long and were not so effective. You only need such a small amount so in the end, it will be very economical and the results are superior to other products I've tried. The products also seem to encourage a natural exfoliation and deep cleansing, so you save money on all those other products you used to have to buy all the time. Plus, your skin will clear up and you can say goodbye to all those annoying costly solutions to a problem these products actually prevent. 

The entire line deserves 100 Stars! If you struggle to 
keep your skin clear, these products also provide
a new sense of confidence and are emotionally healing. 

Another surprising use for this product is on scars. Old
scars and new scars. They seem to just fade away. 

As Liv Tyler once said: ""I Swear Buy."" Well, she was talking about the shampoo. 

I say: ""Collect Them."" These products are essential and the best I've ever tried.

I have the large bottle, body mousse & deodorent at home, and the smaller bottle in my handbag. I don't get bored with this fragrence, like I do with everything else I've tried over the years.

The first time I wore Pink Sugar to work one colleague commented on the aroma of drinking chocolate as I was in the lift with her. The next time I was in the lift, everyone commented on my lovely vanilla perfume. After I applied a freshen up spray, another colleague said she could smell cakes! Yet another colleague demanded to know what I was wearing, and where she could get some. Strangers come up to me in the street to ask what scent I'm wearing...

No this isn't a cheesy ad, it really happened!! 


What do I sense first? Liquorice, a rich aniseed scent that gradually settles into a middle note of caramel. Marshmallow is the first word that springs to mind to me. 

If you like Angel, Fantasy or Princess you need to give this a try!

Waterproof, smudgeproof, expensive, drugstore, you name it I've tried it.  Every single one left dark shadows under my eyes within 2 or 3 hours.  I'd given up on mascara completely, but thought I'd try one more time with this (with the money back guarantee from spalook, what's the risk?)

This mascara lives up to it's name as smudge-proof.  Even wearing sunscreen on my under-eye area, it doesn't transfer.  Even in 100+ deg Phoenix heat, it stays.  I *love* it for this reason.  It also comes off easily at night; no problems there.

However, I'm giving it only 4 stars because it does flake a little throughout the day.  Not a lot, and not enough to make me stop using it (the first truly smudge-proof mascara I've found), but it is there.  Since it's advertised as smudge and flake-proof, I can't give it the full 5 stars"

The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is, that even though they come in different colors, they all look more black than colored when dry. So the color doesn't stand out enough.

Provost,"Portland, OR United States","I have suffered from rosacia for the past nine years. As I was fairly young to be starting through a change of life, I had no idea what was causing my complexion problems. Not understanding (or expecting)what was happening to my skin, I made many many mistakes during the first year or so, trying to remedy the symptoms with countless products formulated more for adult acne or aging tired skin, bad idea. If you have rosacea or very sensitive skin, you know that sometimes it seems that all you need do is touch your skin the wrong way and you break out, let alone slathering some chemically based, perfumed, or exfoliating (ground pits and the like) product on your face. This becomes especially discouraging when you are also beginning to see the normal signs of aging but sensitivities won't allow you to take advantage of some of the great treatments out there to nourish your skin and stay a step ahead of the wrinkles, not to mention feeling starved for the moisture which is the real key to younger, healthy looking skin. After awhile I was afraid to try anything else, so I just stopped. I washed my face gently and left it at that. Well it only got worse and I felt like a dried up prune. Enter Philosophy hope in a jar for dry sensitive skin. It's as if this product was made just for me. Now instead of people asking me ""what's wrong with your face?"" they ask, ""what type of skincare do you use?"" Since I've been using The Philosophy skin care line, I find I guite often feel comfortable going out without makeup, something I had rarely done since my twenties. Since sun protection is so important, Philosophy offers a product called, When hope is not enough with spf 20 for daytime which comes in a bottle, but I have found that my skin responds much better to the Hope in a jar-dry sensitive formula, then followed by Philosophy's seperate sunsreen called Shelter-spf 15. This is because ""Shelter"" does not contain vitamin C or peptides and has a slightly lower concentration of sunscreens, contrary to the spf-20 moisurizer combo. You may be able to get by with the combination product and save a few bucks, but the aforementioned ingredients in it do not agree with my sensitivities, especially the vitamin C. As for the much needed exfoliation dilemma, try philosophy's, Micro-delivery peel pads or their ""Peel kit"" both are soothing and non-abrasive. Hope this helps and enjoy your new skin!"

The predominent note is a sparkling anise, an anise that affects a cold, even metallic, chemic artifice. Swirling about this shivery base note are hints of moss, violet, and vanilla-like tonka, lending an aura of both forest and fantasy. 

Though this is a relatively popular scent, Lolita eschews convention. There are no white flowers, no rose, no peach, none of the banal and cloying sweetness that plagues so many scents. This perfume is instead sensual yet apart, not at all come-hither but insinuating and dark as a Grimm's tale. The tonka is sweet and powdery, gently seductive, while the more prominent anise intoxicates.

The bottle is stunning; I never throw out a spent one. "

I think they could add double the rose oil, but you can add in rose and ylang ylang if you are in the mood. The Tisty Tosty heart-shaped bath bomb is perfect if you enjoy blending your own essential oils or prefer a mild/calming bathing experience. 

I'd suggest using this one for skin calming and also adding in a ""Romance In a Stone,"" ""Sex Bomb"" or ""Chelsea Garden"" bath bomb to add a little more romance to the bath. 

I did feel emotionally calm (rose balances the emotions) and my skin loved this bath bomb, but it was not as sensory as I'd hoped. Following this bath with the ""It's A Pleasure Treasure Massage Bar"" is fun, also heart-shaped. 

You may want to try the ""Violet"" soap with this bathing experience. The next time I try this, I might mix it with an ""Elixir"" bath melt and a bit of the ""Bathos"" bubble bar, also scented with violet. 

As far as this being a magic spell, you just never know who might call you when you use this bath. Probably right when you are in the bath. So, if you think this will work instantly, you might want to keep the phone by the tub. It was funny, but when I was in the bath, my husband was trying to call me and said he let the phone ring and ring. Did he really think I would leave the pleasure of a Lush bath to answer the phone? 

Personally, I think they should scent this bath bomb like the It's a Pleasure Treasure Massage Bar. It is blissfully delicious and almost seems edible - looks like white chocolate (it is mostly cocoa butter) and has a heady scent of orange blossom honey and neroli.

Try all of the bath bombs. I use the Tisty Tosty whenever I need an evening of self indulgence. Put the water on and watch the heart-shaped bomb fizzle and send hundreds of rose petals floating to the top of the tub.
Put some fluffy bath towels to warm on a rail.
Place some Dr Haushka's oil to heat by a radiator.
Pour a glass of champagne.
Surround the tub with lots of  tea lights.
Put on some Rahman music.
Get in and imagine a private Ganges.
When you get out its very eassy to scoop up the petals- take the pre-warmed towels and wrap yourself in one.

 By then the oils will be warm and pour in palm of hand and rub on body.

I expected to get stretchmarks because my mom had them with me, so I was happy to get anything less than hers.  Anyway, I didn't get any at all on my stomach until the last two weeks (my baby was 8lbs. 8oz.) and they are really small.  I put the cream on my breasts and abdomen every day after a shower, but because it was expensive I skipped my sides (love handle area) and did get stretchmarks there which were darker than the ones on my stomach.

The weather was cold, wet & dark at home. When I sprayed some on my wrists I wasn't impressed.

Come June & sunny, hot & bright days, I found myself trying `Just Me' in the shops & buying a bottle (which I'm quickly making my way through).

Lighter & easier to wear then `Paris Hilton', I'm using it all the time. Scent wise; the strongest note for me is the pink peppercorn - sharp & tangy. It contrasts nicely with the floral notes, so neither individual note overpowers me.

Overall `Just Me' can be worn anywhere during the day; work, shopping or lunch.
For evening and autumn/winter look elsewhere."

After reading a recommendation from a fashion magazine, which says everybody at every age need an eye cream. Ok, fine, I will get one. I chose the one got the highest rate!

Overall quality, it is very good to moisturize my eye area. This means it is easier to apply foundation/concealer/eye makeup. But my puff is still here. I still have dark circle! No reducing! I know that I need to have a better schedule to have enough sleep but still, I expected higher on this product.

I was super excited to try this because I've been told by numerous people that philosophy's products are spectacular. First, I must point out that there are sparkles in this lip gloss. Although they're very subtle on your lips, if you're the type of gal who hates sparkles and shimmer in your makeup, I'd stay away from this product. As for smell, it DOES smell like cinnamon buns. It certainly does not TASTE like it however (which is a good thing... I tend to lick off my lip gloss if it tastes good... this lip gloss does not taste good). It's very sticky and thick so you don't have to use too much. It also stays on your lips for a good amount of time. Would I suggest this product? If you're looking for a good-smelling, long lasting lip gloss, I'd definitely recommend this. However, if these two things don't matter to you I'd suggest you skip this ($10 for a tube of lip gloss isn't cheap after all) and go for a drugstore brand lip gloss"

That is it say, it changes depending on the light. My white Illuminateur looks purple in some lights, shiny white in others, and a light blue in others. It's really amazing on its own, or layered.

As someone who doesn't own a lot of makeup brushes, I love that it includes one.

Adding to the fragrance's intrigue is an oriental effect achieved by  lace embroidery on the glass.

One of those is Hypnose and I really like it for when I go out or just looking for that dramatic look.

Postive:
1.) The look: I've never neccessarily wanted to wear fake eyelashes but they do look almost perfect. Unbelievably, Hypnose gives you that look. It's amazing just how feathery your eyelashes look.
2.) Flaking: This mascara never really flaked on the bottom of my eyes. That's really important to me.

Negative:
1.) This mascara starts out great but after about two and a half weeks it starts emptying out on you. This might just be because there were days when I reapplyed it or simply because I just used it pretty well (1 coat just about everyday because of how much I liked it).

Summary: If you want that natural yet ""are those real lashes?!"" look, then you'll like this mascara. I'm giving it four stars instead of five simply because of how long it lasts but if you use it once it a while, then it will last you a while"

Just one word of warning -- you can't really go by the color samples. It's better to see them in person. I bought Lilac Mist which is beautiful on the brow bone and was very close to what I was expecting. But Paris By Night looks like a gray but is actually a deep mauve.

The peach note in some fragrances also turns funky on my skin, but I have not had this problem with Eau de Recolte Bleue.  I prefer this over their Lavender Harvest fragrance, which I think would smell better on men (JMOP.)

Here is a description from their website:

""Eau de la RÃ©colte Bleue exudes all the pleasures of Provence. Both fresh and as light as air, it captures the celebratory feel of the Lavender Harvest.

Composed from a blend of the green scent of leaves and A.O.C. Lavender essential oil, Eau de la RÃ©colte Bleue is accompanied by the delicate notes of freesia, marigold and frosted peach. Woody and musky aromas then leave a lingering and sensual, fragrant trail.""

First, I have to say that the texture is intriguing.  It's a balm, but it feels much more velvety, and the slight shimmer gives you a sheen.

Second, I am a sucker for the packaging and presentation.  It comes in a little tin box, with the signature Bathina (very retro chic) and a black powder puff that has a pink ribbon holder.  It makes you want to apply the product in public, just to have an excuse to show off the set.  Also, it ups the feminity factor of applying a product with the little puff (very ""I adore being a girl..."")

Then, there's the scent.  It's a floral, sexy fragrance that doesn't overpower.  It's clean and a big plus is that it doesn't make me sneeze, like some other scents.

I think that a little goes a long way, and thus, I can say that even though it's a ""boutique-brand"" product, it is very affordable.  I think that as warmer weather sets in, and you want to show off a little more skin, this is a product that would enhance a tan."

You will also notice your hair becoming stronger and retaining a much deeper shine. The essential oils in this product help to activate micro-circulation which may cause a slight tingling and warming of the scalp. Leave this in for about 5-10 minutes and then wash your hair as normal. You may find you need less conditioner when using this product.

This solid shampoo bar works wonderfully; I had my doubts just like everyone else, and was worried that this would remove the build up but leave the hair overly squeaky clean and stripped, and if it would later at all. To my surprise this small disc turns into an avalanche of bubbles once I wet it and rub it between the hands. I also wet my hair and rub the bar all over, working with the lather form my hands and the lather from the wet bar. I have to admit that this produces more lather than liquid shampoos and washes the hair without leaving it feeling like it was tortured, instead its slippery and wonderfully light. Afterwards I follow with the American Cream conditioner (probably the best hair scented product in the universe) also from Lush for a head of hair that feels rich and buttery soft, with a fresh light fragrance that lingers on.

The scent itself is wonderful, citrusy and earthy, with Patchouli Oil, Orange Oil, Lavendin Oil, Pine Oil , Lemongrass Oil , Elemi Oil , Gardenia Extract and the Roman Chamomile Flower. I often find that all the oils and rich botanicals nourish the hair and leave it feeling happy, organic and natural products have been of high interest to me lately because of the results they deliver for bouncy hair and supple skin. After using drugstore and even expansive brands of hair products and skin potions, I find that my skin and hair never really benefited from all those preservatives and unnatural products derived from mineral oils and god knows what else. Lush and Burt's Bees, Jason and The Body Shop made me change my mind and seek out products that are as good as they smell, and that truly transform me from a sleepy duckling in the morning to a happy princess by the time my morning routine is over.

Lipglass feels good on your lips, as if it contained some emollients. And (this is a big AND) it's not tacky or sticky. 

The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. 

Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact.

i'm one of those unfortunate few who for some reason or the other always end up with ""panda eyes"" at the end of the day due to mascara run-off. i've tried everything from cheap to expensive, and from regular to waterproof mascaras to no avail. somehow though, this mascara, because of the unique properties of the fibers will not smudge on the skin, no matter how humid or wet the day is. the cool thing about it is that if you rub your eyes the fiber will fall, but not stain the skin, thus eliminating the panda eye effect. the fibers will coat the eyelashes and dry up, forming a sort of tube around the lashes and are surprisingly easy to clean at the end of the day, no special solutions needed. when you clean your eyelashes you can actually see the fibers loosen up and leave your lashes without any residue.

i am also a contact lens wearer and this product, unlike many other mascaras, doesn't irritate my eyes and lasts practically forever.

this has to be the best mascara i have used yet, and that is saying something. even the expensive department store and specialty mascaras pale next to this. and i even bought it at a local japanese drugstore!

never leave home without it; it's possibly the last mascara you'll ever need"

And at about a week per blade, even with ""two-pass"" shaving (once with the grain of the beard and once against it), that's enough for a few years.

I've been using Merkur blades for almost 25 years, and for overall quality and value, I'd say they're the best around. I've found them best when teamed with the Merkur ""Progress"" adjustable razor.

This product has actual coconut oil which I also use on it's own, my boss who is a gorgeous Indian woman gets me coconut oil from her local supermarket and she told me to heat it up in the microwave for 15 seconds and then apply to dry hair, massaging into the scalp and letting it sit as long as I can before shampooing out twice to find my hair shiny and luxuriously full of volume and softness. The same oil is really amazing on the skin, not only does it smell like coconut milk with powdered milk mixed together but is wonderful on dry winter days when my skin wants to turn red and be irritated.

Fabulously creamy and comforting this indulgent cream settles me in for a cozy and warm night, because there's nothing better than a warm shower with a great product that makes me want to jump into a clean, fuzzy bed and dream of sweet things.

Cynthia Sylvia Stout is a much more pleasant experience with beer blended with fresh lemon juice, cognac oil and lemon oil. It looks a little like a chocolate syrup and I didn't think it had a very strong beer scent. 

Strangely enough, the scent sort of reminds me of freshly made whole wheat yeast dough (perhaps with a hint of lemon zest), which is currently baking in my bread baker. This is a very cleansing shampoo that you might want to use when your hair is misbehaving and needs a little shine and control. You may only need to shampoo once since this really cleans well the first time. 

Using this with the Veganese conditioner will leave your hair feeling super clean and not overly conditioned. If you want a deeper conditioning experience, try American Cream conditioner which is simply intoxicating. Please don't make me live without it! 

While I enjoyed using Cynthia Sylvia Stout shampoo, I still think my first love is Rehab shampoo (the scent of Rehab is divine). This shampoo did make my hair feel silky and soft so I'll definitely buy it again.

I don't smell it on my hair when it's dry as other reviewers have noticed - although I use (non-Lush) conditioner afterwards, so maybe that tends to wash the smell away?

This shampoo makes my hair SO shiny.  I have long blonde hair, and it really makes it glow like nothing else.  I don't know how it does it...but people will literally come up to me and comment on how nice and shiny my hair looks on the days I use this product!

Do believe I was told this numerous times as I tried eveything to banish the light spray of freckles across my nose. Well, those nose freckles did eventually disappear but in their place came sun spots on my hands.
Gardening is one of my hobbies, and I love to be out of doors. I know, I know - wear garden gloves. For me, digging in the dirt isn't enjoyable in gloved hands. Hence, sun spots.

Over a period of weeks Cellex-C Fade Away Gel has markedly faded the most obvious spots. It isn't oily so I apply the gel to the sun spots twice a day, in the morning and at night. 

By remembering to apply sunscreen to my hands before going outside I think I'll be able to maintain the beneficial effects of this gel.

Even if you have sensitive skin, this cleanser is perfect, of course there are other great cleanser options if you think this will irritate your skin. Also, this cleanser really helps to minimize/clean out your pores. I really noticed a difference after using it for only a week.
I also recommend the Perfecting Lotion especially if you have slightly oily skin. I use it during the day and even at night(!)because it really improves my skin and I dont wake up with zits in the morning :)Plus, It saves me money since i dont have to by an acne treatment gel to put under my lotion"

The color is NOT neutral, but I find that I can wear it with almost any color of clothing except primarily pink or red outfits. Over the years it has become just about the only lipstick shade I wear. I would buy different brands,different shades and wear them maybe once then back to Guava Stain. It along with Clinque's soft pressed blush in New Clover, orginally bought about the same time as the lipstick have become my favorites, and the one's I reach for time and again.

The cream comes in a slick white tube with a gold and orange stripe at the top and can be squeezed out like toothpaste as the thick metal tube lets me get to the very last bit at the end, a total bonus since I hate wasting product.

Expensive, but well  worth it since Dr. Hauschka products are extremely natural and healing in their properties with no harsh chemicals disguised by pink dyes and fragrances. This cream smells like a pale pink Bulgarian rose garden, something I got to experience as a child as it makes me smile twenty years later as I used this cream. Winter and high times of stress or freaky dry skin episodes are the usual scenarios that would require me to use this cream as I usually stick to my favorite green tube of Cetaphil lotion as my day and night moisturizer ever since I got it from my dermatologist who did wonders to my complexion two years ago.

Great as a face cream and also wonderful as eye cream, especially when the computer I use at work always seems to suck any moisture form my eye area right out. This patted right on top of makeup refreshes and plumps up the skin, and only a tiny bit is needed. This cream lasts for months so at this price it's really a bargain considering that what I put on my face always shows up as results or neglect if the wrong product is use.

After too many years of uncomfortable shaves and having to wait 2-3 days between shaving to let my raw, sore neck recover, I finally started to do some research into what I could add to my regimen/technique to improve results. I read numerous articles about the benefits of pre-shave oil, so I decided to add this stuff to my arsenal...and I'm NEVER going back.

First off, the price might be a detrement to those who are used to $3/can drug store shaving cream, but a little goes a long way, and this little bottle might actually last you longer than 4 or 5 cans of cream or gel. You only use a small amount each day, and it spreads evenly over your whole face. When used in tandem with a good shaving cream, it virtually eliminates razor burn and uncomfortable shaving. My razor glides over my face each morning now. If you look at your razor each morning with disgust like I used to, give this stuff a shot. I guarantee you won't be disappointed. Try their shaving cream and ""old school"" shaving brush as well. Pamper your face...this is how shaving was supposed to be before cheap aerosol shaving cream and disposable plastic razors started ripping our faces to shreds"

I have only been working for the company at their Santa Barbara store for about 2 weeks, and this is what I've learned about the Artemesia Shampoo: This IS the shampoo that ALL Four Season's Carry. The packageing may seem different if you were at a four season's in another country, but this is the ONLY shampoo of ours that they carry (once in a while people dont believe me, but TRUST me- they train us on which one it is).  People come in everyday for this shampoo because they loved it so much at the four seasons.  In fact, the company SOLD OUT and our store (which ran out quickly because there is a four seasons in Santa Barbara) had many unhappy customers because they couldnt find it.  The scent is heavenly and lasting on your hair. Some other products you might want to try out? The four Seasons also carrys our Verbena Shea Soap, Verbena body lotion, and our Lavender linen water (which makes clothes smell great when used in ironing). Also, just to let you know, this week we're getting new products for our Honey line (btw- try the honey body balm- I'm HOOKED) including a cleanser, milk bath, and honey massage nectar.

I used to get ingrown hairs so bad on my face that they would be there for MONTHS. Eventually I'd get to the point of having to do my own surgery with a needle to try and extract the hair.

If I get an ingrown hair now, I just use Tend Skin once in the morning and once before bed, and it actually extracts the hair on it's own! It gets rid of the redness and swelling also associated with ingrown hairs.

Then night cream, eye cream (""dab on gently, never rub""), a special lotion for her throat and collarbone area.  She would impart her beauty secrets to me while I sat transfixed.  Although I was convinced that she was the most beautiful woman in the world, I was surprised that with all these lotions and oils, she didn't' slide right out of bed at night.  ""Exercise, Sweetheart.  Drink lots of water.  Never go to sleep in your makeup--no matter how tired you are.  Never wash your face with regular soap.  Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize.  Your skin has to last you a lifetime and nothing gives away a woman's age like uncared for skin.""  While I am not sure where I would even find 'cold cream' today, I follow the vast majority of her regimen.  The two items that I use for under my eyes are Avon's Repair Eye Serum and Hydrofirming Bio6 Eye Cream.  The cream plumps up and firms the delicate tissue around the eye, and the serum smoothes and moisturizes the skin.

I consider Avon products to be the unsung work horses of the beauty industry.  They almost always do exactly what they say they are going to do and at a very modest price.   Expensive boutique and department store products rarely do a better job and are usually exorbitantly overpriced.   When you factor in that Avon products go on sale regularly (which is when I usually stock up), you are getting an even better deal for your money.  While I am not a complete cheapskate, I love a bargain and I want to feel like I am getting full value for my money.

The skin around the eyes is quite thin and delicate, so I think if you follow my Mother's advice and ""dab on gently, never rub"" Avon's Repair Eye Serum and Hydrofirming Bio6 Eye Cream you will be able to keep this area smooth, without being greasy, even with the most drying of climatic conditions"

Brunyansky ""dustypoetbooks""","North Canton, OH USA","I've been using Avon products since I was a teen.  I started using the eye serum a couple of years ago after Avon discontinued their wonderful eye gel.  I will be 60 this year and have no wrinkles around my eyes and few on my face either, though I am a dry-skinned redhead. 

Contrary to what someone else here said, I find that it does absorb very quickly.  I buy it because it is NOT oily--oily makeup around my eyes makes my eyes burn, and this gives me no problems at all.  Also, I have sensitive skin so I have to use hypoallergenic makeup.  This fills that bill too.  Try it!!  It's great!!  "

It was a nice alternative to all my candy scented perfumes.

I have terrible circulation.  I get cold and stay that way.  From time to time I'm also an insomniac.  The Wiccy Massage Bar has a cure for both.  The cinnamon leaf is very warming on the skin and the Aduki beans seem to help this warmth penetrate. (They also fall all over the floor if you're not careful...but you wont care..the bar is THAT good). The oil is thick and lovely - but be careful about rubbing up against anything it may stain.  This is one of the reasons I only ever use it before bedtime.  Who cares if it messes up the Cartman Flannel Pajama bottoms?  

Speaking of bedtime...I'm not sure what it is..whether it's the cinnamon or the other essential oils I can't name, but they have a very calming effect.  Much better than yucky smelling lavender.  Helps me get to sleep in no time flat.  

I rub it on the back of my neck and sometimes, even on the underside of my pillow case, for this soft comfy shut eye"

You were me. Looking for what seemed to be a simple thing - a scented candle that ACTUALLY smells up the room when you light it. You've bought the cheap ones in the grocery store that sent out the weak scent of, well, grocery store. And some candles smell like spray room deodorizer which smells like what one would use in the toilet which then make you think of poop which is not at all what you were going for in the living room. So then you hit the expensive pretty versions - perhaps even in candle stores with cute waxy names. They are not candles, my friend. They are sculptures. Some fancy ones come with cute packaging and crispy dried flowers. This is when you lose your patience. I DO NOT WANT CRISPY DRIED FLOWERS. I WANT A CANDLE THAT PUMPS A GOOD SCENT ALL OVER A ROOM WHEN I LIGHT IT.

This is it. Votivo. You will walk into the room and that room will smell like the candle. The most universally loved scent is probably Red Currant. I also enjoy Rain. The little glass it comes in makes a cute vase after the candle is done. Plus, they make perfect last minute hostess gifts, as the box is very nice and expensive-looking.

So, Votivo isn't the cheapest candle in the world. They're still cheaper than buying a bunch of cheap candles that stink...weakly stink."

I am not sure where I go when I inhale deeply, but I am no longer in the shower. Follow this with the Skin Sin lotion and you will enter a little bit of heaven on earth.

I have both the ""karma kream"" lotion and karma dusting powder from Lush, and I love them as well, but the soap is still my favorite. Next time I go to their store I'm going to buy the biggest brick of this stuff that I can, because it's great! Just a simple gylcerine-based soap with a dark orange-red hue, but the smell is just so wonderful that every time I wash my hands it turns into some sort of new-age deep-breathing exercise while I try to get as much of that lovely scent into my nostrils as I can.

I've found that this soap lathers better than others, but you have to be careful not to leave it in the shower all the time, or it will get soft and melt away with the condensation. Trust me, you don't want to waste any of this stuff by letting it leak into the drain while other people are using the bathroom! I leave mine out so it can make my bathroom smell really great as an added bonus :)

Fresh, fruity, citrusy, with just a tiny hint of patchouli to give it an earthy note. Definitely a winner from Lush! As soon as I smelled this soap in their store for the first time, I loved this scent. As you can tell from the reviews, a lot of other people do, too"

The deep purple color is remnicent of crushed blackberries and the scent is a mingling of lemon, coconut, Bergamot and violets. The truth is, this shampoo is one of the best shampoos Lush sells and I think it gives even more body and texture than Rehab. Use this and follow with the Coolaulin conditioner for shiny bouncy hair that is scented with violets and coconut. 

The fragrance follows you around for hours and envelops you in a comforting warmth. This shampoo may have you dreaming about the Purple Haze gift box filled with violet, lavender and blackcurrant items or looking into the ""Gratuitous Violets"" soap. 

To complete the experience, you may want the ""Smitten"" hand cream - quite luxurious and comforting. For some reason, the All That Jas bath item worked well with the violet scent so my house is now scented with Jasmine and Violets and I feel like I'm walking in fields of flowers.

I really only went to pick up a free moisturizer as I've found with some judicious sampling you don't have to pay for that item. Instead, I fell in love with this soap (and got free moisturizer too-hooray!!)

When the sales rep first handed me the bar soap, I balked. I've known people who've used Clinique but just the idea of washing my face with BAR soap freaked me out. They do offer a liquid version but the rep told me the soap was a better exfoliant. I can't say for sure if that's so but I can say this really is a great face wash. I was addicted after one use. And since it is a bar of soap, you'll get a really great sudsy foam. It has a mild, pleasant scent and it washes off easily. I have the mild version and I just love it. My skin feels clean but never tight and not only does it not cause breakouts, it immediately calmed the one I had. I'll definitely be buying more. 

I do want to add, however, it is drying in the wintertime if you have normal skin and I had to switch to a cream cleanser. It may not be a problem for oily skin. For dry skin, I'd really avoid it in the winter at least.

You still ideally need a makeup remover before the soap. I also became a recent convert to Clinique's Rinse Off Foaming Cleanser. But even if you don't want to use that product, remember that removing your makeup is a separate step."

After just one to two uses, you start to notice a sense of calm and order descending upon your formerly sensitive skin. Weeks later you look at your skin and it seems like you are at least ten years younger. The smoothness, clarity and youthful glow truly shows with continued use. 

If you have oily or combination skin, you may be amazed at how balanced your skin is and how you no longer experience the shine breakthrough in your makeup due to the initially drying aspects of other cleansers. 

The Komenuka Bijin Facial Cleansing Foam is very economical and an eighth of a teaspoon is enough for a wonderful face cleansing experience. The ingredients include: Rice Germ Oil, Rice Bran, Coconut Oil, Seaweed, Aloe Algae, Ginkgo Biloba, Matricaria, Yeast, Perilla Ocymoides, Honey, Lithospermum and Fountain Water.

The Moisture Cream goes a long way. The main oils are Rice Germ Oil, Jojoba Oil and Olive Oil. Vitamin E, Rice Bran and Aloe make this a skin-healing treat.

Other products to fall in love with: 

Cleansing Powder - Packets of deep cleansing grains turn silky and creamy when you add water. 

Makeup Remover - A fragrance-free cream that removes makeup and mascara. Based on olive oil. 

UV Cream - Slightly tinted and waterproof, this sunblock also seems to even out skin tone. Could be used as a makeup base if you are looking for a more natural look. 

Hair Shampoo & Conditioner - Thickens fine hair instantly. Removes buildup and leaves your hair feeling luxurious. 

Essence - This is a product that is magical. It can be used for skin healing and it also lightens freckles and age spots.

It didn't smell like hot (coconut) milk to me - it has a warm, spicy, pleasant scent - but it definitely had that ""warm milk before bedtime"" effect. And it works miracles on my rambunctious two-year-old daughter. Not only does it produce LOADS of bubbles (fwiw we have an oversized clawfoot tub, and a third of a bar filled it to the top w/bubbles) but the scent seems to calm and relax her as much as me. Warning: don't take this bath if you're planning an evening out! You'll just want to snuggle into bed afterwards"

	One of my favorites in this line is the Illuminating Stick, an easy way to achieve an instant glow.  The stick is available in two shades, Golden Honey Glow, which provides a subtle bronze luster, and Golden Rose Glow, which very much resembles a natural blush.

	With earth minerals for a lovely luster and shine, the color is applied directly to the skin with fingertips or brush.  It blends smoothly and leaves a soft, velvety texture.

	There's no limit to where it can be used - as a blush on the apple of the cheeks or across forehead, brow bone or chin for a ""just in from a day at the beach"" look.  For evening my preference is the Honey Glow applied across shoulders as well.

	Key ingredients include Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Vitamin A, and Bismuth Oxychoride, which acts as a light reflector by sun or moonlight"
B000A0QQRQ:all-around_best_razor:joseph_dipietro,B000A0QQRQ,Merkur Progress Double Edge Safety Razor: Beauty,beauty,2 of 2,5.0,All-around best razor,"December 21, 2006",Joseph Dipietro,"Philadelphia, PA","Having shaved with everything from cheapo disposables to Thiers-Issard straight razors, I have to say that the Merkur Progress is probably the best all-around razor available today. It has excellent heft and balance, and the adjustment feature is simple and straightforward. (Although I do agree that the numbered adjustment seems to perform a little differently depending on the blade used.) It is easy to keep clean--assuming you don't mind unscrewing it and taking the blade out to wipe off the head and frame. Having also used a venerable old Gillette ""fat boy"" from the 1950s, I'd still have to rate the Progress as a better razor; the screw operated adjustment makes it constantly adjustable, not just in steps. 

Since this is a safety razor, its performance is significantly dependent on the blades used. I've tried both the Merkur blades and the Japanese ""Feather"" blades, and would say that it's a toss-up. 

And since it is an adjustable safety razor, it is perfectly suited to two-pass close shaving. A higher setting is excellent on the first pass with the grain of the beard, and a lower setting for the pass against the grain. The adjustment also allows you to adjust the razor to the conditions of your skin and beard. If you've let yourself get a day's worth of stubble (c'mon--don't we all?) you can set the blade high to mow that hedge. If you need a quick clean-up before a night on the town, you can set it lower for a ""Once lightly, James.""

So if you want a really well-made, no-nonsense but very versatile razor that will last for a good long time, this is a good bet. The only problem might be preventing pals from swiping it, or reminding your wife/significant other to take it apart to clean it after she smooths up those pretty pins you love so well.

One recommendation: Shop around. You can get these for under $40.00 if you bargain-hunt, likewise full 20-count boxes of carded Merkur 10-blade refill sets"

I like the dual concept, with a scrub on one side and a lip balm on the other.  I also like the fact, this slips into you purse or pocket easily, so it's convenient for those on the go.  I took mine skiing in Vail, and it was the first time I didn't come home with chapped lips. 

The textures are good.  The scrub side is slightly grainy, more of a polish than a scrub.  I would not recommend it for heavily chapped lips, but it works well for weekly maintenance. The lip balm side is a little waxy, but moisturizing with vityamin e.  It's quite long-lasting and provides a sweet, natural shine.  This smells of spun vanilla, sweet and sugary.

The scrub part of the stick does a great job, but you need to have lips that aren't in dire need of help for it to really work.  To do that, just use a moist, soft toothbrush, and gently scrub.  The scrub side will sometimes leave a little sugar behind, so you might have to wipe your lips off a little after you use it, but I found that this doesn't happen all the time.

The balm side goes on smoothly, and feels great.  It's silky feeling, but does not provide a lot of moisture, so, if you lips are on the dryer side,  this is not going to replace your regular gloss.

This stuff is great for on the go, and I will be buying it again when mine runs out"

I have chemically treated hair (relaxed, double process - colored & fine hair equals damaged hair), and this is the only conditioner that works for me. Another plus is, this is the only conditioner that elicits ""your hair smells sooooo good"" reaction from my boyfriend & daughter.

Surprisingly, even if it moisturizes my hair excellently, it still leaves it bouncy & with enough volume.

This lasts about 6 months if you use it once a week, so it's really not that expensive, especially if you substitute this for your regular deep conditioning treatment at the salon.

Avocado, olive oil, lemongrass, bergamot, rosewood oil, gardenia extract makes this a skin calming, soothing, moisturizing dream. The ""green luster"" makes this bath especially beautiful and gives it a mermaid mood. I loved this one so much, I'm ordering two the next time. 

The scent is lemon/lime, but by the time you get in the tub, the floral scents are more prominent. You can add in some bubbles, but they don't seem to last very long - well, I was using a bath gel. 

So, you may want to find a bubble bar because the olive oil seems to make them disappear pretty fast. At least, that is my theory because I've noticed bath oil does the same thing. Avobath goes well with Whoosh products or the Happy Hippy Shower gel. If you are in the mood, you might want the amazing ""Godiva"" shampoo and conditioner 2 in 1 bar (has a magical quality - makes hair super shiny) or the ""I love Juicy"" shampoo and ""Veganese"" conditioner. The last two also have a citrus scent and are especially delicious. 

When I use Lush products, I'm in a good mood all week long. It is truly amazing how happy and content I am as long as I have some Lush products around. :)

Add a sizzling lemony-herbal top note to Froot Loops and you have this bomb's scent.

Since lemongrass oil is good for uplifting the spirits, this is a great bomb for those tired or grumpy days we all have sometimes.

There is the mildest shimmer to it, that you really have to look for in the water itself, and it gives the lime-green water a lovely depth and sparkle. But it isn't glittery and you won't end up with anything you can see on your skin. It is more an in-bath pony trick!

Well if your asking yourself that question, YES!  These things have amazing grip and can pull the tinyiest of hairs.  Things that you would have to dig with normal tweezers until you finally rub your skin raw.

It seems I am one of those people forever stuck in a time warp and prefer this classic instead of trying new scents. While I prefer the eau de parfum spray I have both variations. Although at first this tends to have a strong aroma, this doesn't last after being applied to your skin. I love the blend of vanilla, mandarin orange, peach and lemon that make up the scent of ObsessionÂ®.

My preference is more of a racy, provocative, alluring scent instead of brimming like flowers. With my skin irritations, asthma and allergies I have no problems with spraying my body parts with ObsessionÂ®. The color is quite appealing, reminding me of Spiced Rum with the brown, amber and gold tones. ObsessionÂ® cologne is suitable for both day and evening wear, indoors and outdoors and those luscious intimate settings. 

This is definitely a feminine scent, sweet, sexy and not too fruity or powerful.   There is a gold toned rim with the cap snapping on and pulling off most of the time with ease. Sometimes the lid does not go on just right and then the cap part becomes undone and this makes two pieces.

Once the scent has set in for awhile on my skin I detect a hint of floral with wood combination and have read on fragrance.net that ObsessionÂ® has oriental spices. It really is a winning combination that has captured my interest over the years. This is a scent that is recognizable by men and women and can be worn through out the seasons. 

I would not say this is a musk scent but more of a spicy tingle that needs to be only administered once a day for long lasting appeal. The appeal of ObsessionÂ® seems to run from girls in their early twenties to those of us in our early forties, from conservative ladies to party animals. 
 
Although it is a darker color than most fragrances, there is no staining on clothing, but I do not wear sweaters, whites or turtlenecks. When I do use the glass jar I have noticed frequently when standing over the sink the yellowish/brown tint left in the sink and have to rinse it off as well as my finger tips. 

ObsessionÂ® is a potent and romantic perfume for evening. The prices of the assorted sizes of ObsessionÂ® range from forty to sixty dollars. "

Mistral, as I was happy to discover,  is also the name of a line of bath and body products, all French inspired, all lusciously lovely from scented soaps to soothing lotions to rejuvenating body butters.

	Matthew Tilker, founder and president of Mistral,  utilizes Shea butter, which is an efficacious natural healer, in a myriad of must-have forms.  Derived  from the nuts of the African Shea Tree (according to sacred custom the nuts are  harvested primarily by women), this butter  is  highly emollient,  a boon for those with dry skin, chapped lips, any number of skin irritations.

	The pure Shea Butter soap comes in a plethora of inviting fragrances, all milled six times (while others boast being  triple milled).  South Seas is a particular favorite - it's as fresh as an ocean breeze and as calming, soothing as a tropical island.  The marine scent is accented with a touch of grapefruit, white flowers and soft woods.  An irresistible combination.

	South Seas is a fragrance with which you wish to surround yourself - made possible by the shower gel, body lotion, massage bath and body oil, bath salts and candle all available at very accessible prices.

	Highly recommended"

This gives me hardly any nicks compared to the Gillette Mach 3 and is way easier to unclog than the Shick Quattro. 

The sample blade continues to last with about 2 shaves a week since Dec. 2006. Typical razor cartridges wouldn't even come close to that longevity, and they cost about 4 times as much as the replacement Merkur blades, which are 50 cents each.

I am just doing facial shaving with it at this point; hopefully it will fare just as well with head shaving. I expect I'll be using Merkur for the rest of my life"

I may eventually decide to upgrade, but if I ever do, it will only be after much practice with this razor and simply for the sake of having the adjustment feature, which may or may not be necessary for some individuals depending on the toughness and thickness of your beard.  When used in conjunction with a badger hair shaving brush, some excellent shaving cream (Proraso was my first, and the only thing mildly unpleasant is the scent, and even that grows on you after a while...check your local Target near the women's spa section) and the highest quality DE razor blade, changed every so often, of course, this razor provides an excellent, close, irritation-free shave.  After using this marvel, I vow never to return to the cheaply made, ridiculously expensive (when the cost of replacement cartridges is considered over the course of a man's shaving lifetime) multi-blade systems of Gillette or Schick.  Just be a little more careful of your technique, and getting an outstanding shave from this razor should be a cinch.  Highly recommended"

I have used the BIG shampoo with other conditioners and it was not as good for me.  I like Big shampoo, but this VEGANESE conditioner is the real key to my newly bouncy hair.  VEGANESE just works perfectly for me and my hair has never looked better.

One thing -- I kind of hate the smell and I do not think it is lemony at all.  It smells...I don't know, too much like an ""granola girl"" or something -- almost patchouli-like to me.  HOWEVER it leaves my hair looking super, so really, who cares if it smells good in the shower"

The lemon oil in two of the Lush products work together especially well. Veganese Conditioner and I Love Juicy shampoo could not be a better solution if you need to deep clean your hair. Like after you have put too much hairspray in your hair or you went swimming or say you fell in a mud puddle (In that case, also reach for Happy Hippy body wash). 

You just never know what may occur and one must always be prepared. The Veganese is also a lovely vegetarian product that can be enjoyed by anyone. It has a very clean, happy energy and a lemony scent. The slippery conditioner slicks across your hair, making it shiny and manageable without weighing it down.

This also contains rosemary infusion, lavender flower infusion, seaweed and fresh lemon juice. Will be appreciated by anyone trying to lighten their hair. 

If you use the henna products by Lush, these two products might slightly lighten your henna results. This could be desired or you may want to go back to using Rehab and American Cream if you want to keep a deeper henna shade.

If you want to feel light and breezy, this conditioner won't weigh you down. My hair feels fluffy and deliciously light and bouncy. I have this strange urge to go wander in lemon orchards, run through mud puddles and pick flowers by the side of the road. 

Now officially in the mood to make lemonade!

When I think of the word peel I imagine the old gel type peels that you would let dry on your face and then take off like a mask. Or I think of something that is harsh or abrasive. While this works like a peel it is gentle and goes far beyond what you would expect a facial product to do.

You need this product if you
- your skin is prone to break out and is very congested  
- your skin is sun damaged  
- your skin is aging rapidly  
- you enjoy in-office medical peels 
- you have a big event coming up and want your skin to look great  
- you want to maximize penetration of your treatment products 
- you want baby soft skin 


Also if you smoke! I first tried this years ago when I was a smoker and it made such a difference in the texture and clarity of my skin. 

This is a truly amazing product and completely different and unique to anything else on the market. Try it and you'll see.

This product also lasts a surprisingly long time. You only use half a capsule for each treatment which gives you several months of usage out of it"

Each prismatic color cube is in it's own tiny little clear box with a tiny lid on, those I discard and simply keep the top four squares open unless I out the entire top lid on once I'm done doing my makeup.

I love to sweep the palest shimmery vanilla on the entire brow bone and my whole lid, I usually wear black liquid liner right under the lash line and right on top, creating a black back drop that make applying any eye makeup on top easy and gives it great depth. Then I use the darkest color with a short brush I cut on an angle to blend the dark color on top of the liner for a smoky and glowing effect. The other two colors I layer on top in between the vanilla base and the dark smoke, but I don't feel the need to use all four colors at the same time. I also wet the brush sometimes, Visine is good for making liquid liner type of a finish when used on a brush and then dipped in some shadow.

The colors have deep intensity to them and they sparkle like melting precious metals in the sun. Wonderful for any makeup novice or artist for their ease of use and the dramatic and breath taking effect they so easily produce.

I still had some Nautica around, plus the original and no-longer-made Zegna scent from Spain, so I used those for a while. I then bought the newest Zegna cologne, ""Z"", after my wife smelled it and found it unobjectionable.  

Well, no sooner had I bought the Z then my wife found a scratch and sniff of Curve in some magazine and said that I really should be using that. The next day we happened to be at K-Mart -- K-MART!!! -- for some household odds and ends, and my wife came across a display of Curve. She insisted on buying it for me. 

Ever since then, my wife goes nuts when I use it. I don't use it during the week, really -- I'm a somewhat older guy, and it has a sweetish overtone to it that's not very serious -- but whenever I do, my wife always tells me how absolutely wonderful I smell, indeed, how DELICIOUS I smell. Today was casual Friday at work, so I figured, okay. I leave for work very early, before my wife is awake. Sure enough, she calls me at work this morning -- ""you used Curve today, didn't you? I can tell because the bathroom smells wonderful!""

Every woman I know who has commented on it loves it on guys. So it's less expensive and available at K-Mart. And yes it is a little bit sweeter than most colognes I'm personally used to. But it does have a pleasant smell, and if the women love it, well . . . "

First of all I have to mention the customer service. I had bought another brand of soap that came in a very pleasing scent combo that Mistral didn't offer. I emailed Mistral's customer service asking them to consider making it. I got a reply right away and after a few email exchanges was told they would see what could be done. I like that--being responsive to the customer.
 What do I like about the soap? For one thing, the size. It's huge at 7 oz. I also like the scents offered: Very pleasing combinations that stay on the skin in a subtle way once you rinse and dry. Best of all is how it lathers up on the skin and once rinsed off leaves no residue. It does leave the skin soft."

Amazing, and highly recommended. Soak in the tub/shower/whatever so the hot water softens up your skin, then scrub away. The small bar lasts 2 or 3 uses; the large is twice as big. The small one is more reasonably priced for people who just want to sample the stuff.

This thing has lots of great little scrubby bits in it. Ground rice, ground almonds, AND adzuku beans. Not just one, but three, and they are all super-scrubby. You'll be a little red when you're done, but it's SO worth it once you've cooled off and your skin is as smooth as a baby's bottom.

The only downside is that it makes your tub look like somebody dumped sand into the bottom of it once the thing drains. The bar melts at around 'hot water' temperature, and you're not supposed to use any moisturizer after using this stuff - but you really don't have to! The moisturizing oils in the bar really do work very well. I'll definitely be picking up a couple more of these.

The cocoa butter/lemon/lavendar scent is really amazing as well. Soothing AND refreshing, it can wake you up in the morning or calm you down at night before you go to sleep. Definitely try this thing, though, if you're looking for ultimate exfoliation plus moisturizing"

Marino,"Niagara Falls, NY","I have been struggling with dry skin and mild acne for years. Recently, I revamped my cleansing routine and my makeup. I bought the Philosphy Purity cleanser and Hope in a Jar. It has made an unbelievable difference in my skin! My skin is smooth, not a dry flake anywhere. It is as soft as a baby's butt.

It is worth noting that a little goes a LONG way. You only need a very small amount (about the size of a dime or less) for your whole face. It is a very light texture, almost like a mousse, and glides over your skin and absorbs quickly. If you use too much (I did the first few times)then your face could look greasy. If you remember that less is more, then you will get a perfectly moisturized, yet matte, complexion.

After using the Philosophy cleanser and Hope in a Jar, I use the Bare Escentuals mineral makeup (bought the Light/Fairly Light starter kit). My skin, for the first time ever, is flawless. No acne. No dry skin. No reddish areas. Just a perfectly smooth complexion. I keep looking in the mirror, thinking ""Is this my skin? Really?"" I cannot believe what a difference this product (and the mineral makeup) has made. 

I have heard of others being allergic to some ingredients in the Hope in a Jar, so it is not for everyone. I suggest getting a sample size to make sure you won't have a reaction"

I have had a chemical peel over a week ago and was given Retin A and therefore my face was peeling so horribly, that I thought I couldn't leave the house. I mean my makeup would literally come right off. I was horrified! I tried several moisterizers sometimes multiple ones but could still see the skin flaking off onto my desk, so I researched this and went to Sephora and bought a kit. I washed my face, did the serum and added this product and I honestly do not see 1 single flake of dry skin, it does tingle but I think it's because my face is raw and so dry but it feels as if my skin is drinking it up like a cold glass of water. I am anxious to see what happens in the weeks to come. I have mild cyctic acne and have struggled with it for years. I decided to see a dermatolist and then got chemical peels it helped to rid me of the bad acne but then I was so dry for 2 wks I couldn't bare to even look at myself. My skin doesn't hurt anymore, for allthe sensitive people, there is a sensitve version but if you have dry skin from the crazy acne treatments they make us do or peels or just dry winter heat, this is the product for you. If it seems strong then use it every other night until you skin can adapt. Or just once a day. I hope you find this product helpful like I did becaus I am still looking in the mirrow that's at my desk"

Then I sampled it at a department store and all my nose could think was ""Wow!"" - gardenias from my grandmother's garden, the suntan oils & tropical perfumes that I smelled as a little girl at the beach, with a few more florals blended in that make this fragrance even more exotic and sensual - I knew I had to have it! I bought myself a bathgel and lotion set and put the large bottle of cologne on my X-mas list, which my sweet & generous boyfriend got for me. 
In my opinion, this is probably the most alluring fragrance for women that I have ever smelled. I feel very alluring every time I wear it for my boyfriend - and he loves it! So this would be a great gift for a man's wife or girlfriend, or for a woman's best friend, sister or cousin (as long as you wear it for your own man, too!), but a slightly awkward gift to give to your mother, aunt or grandmother - it's that enticing. But if your single older relative or friend simply must have it as one of her gifts, then have it given by one of her female friends, sister, cousin or ""Santa"". That way there won't be any awkwardness at gift-giving time. Believe me - this fragrance is the olfactory equivalent of French lingerie or a string bikini! "

If you are the type to buy a product that is endorced by a celebrity, then you can be satisfied here, and if you go to the Mario Badescu website you can see all the celebrities who have gone to the spa and used the products.

If you are looking for a product that makes your skin feel clean and fresh, without spending your paycheck, then you have found the perfect company!!!

I have been using the products from Mario Badescu for three years now, and I have gotten my Mom, Mother-in-Law, Sister, and other friends and family to become Mario Badescu junkies too.

That all said, if you want something to pamper yourself look no further.

(Try the Seaweed Soap, and the Orange Protective Cream. And if you have a problem with Pimples then look for the drying lotion, but beware its strong stuff."

Fancy shmancy I said as I took it out of the delivery box. 
I opened the bottle to take a whiff and my oh my, it's definitely worth the price tag.
The real test of course came at bath time, and this sure delivered beyond looks alone.

The bath water turned bubbly and luscious with earthy aromas of warm, primrose vanilla and the rich, juicy and creamy finish of the apricot. This should be eaten, not bathed in!
Insanely delicious as it would make a wonderful present for any friend or relative, but better yet for yourself.

 Apparently this can be used as a body wash, and I am really looking forward to using it in the shower, as I'm a shower person in the morning, and this would make a tantalizing shower experience for sure. I have reviewed a few of these bath items today, and now I feel so sweet and sleepy after my bath that I feel extremely happy for getting this bubble bath. It's little delectable products such as this one that bring you calm and pleasantness after a long day, and nothing can replace some nice relaxation alone in the tub. Even my boyfriend loved the scent as he used it the other day, so it can be for both men and women, but I might have to hide it in case he secretly likes it too much!"

My only question about this product is whether the vitamin C in it is stable (i.e., should the product be refrigerated to maintain its potency?).  Regardless, it has a sufficient amount of vitamin C for the product to be worthwhile (10% - woo hoo!), and other vitamin C creams are much more expensive.  

The nice thing about this product is that a little really does go a long way.  You squeeze a small amount onto your finger (hygienic packaging!) and spread onto your face.  As the product spreads, it absorbs and has a silky finish.  I'm not sure why, but I have taken to mixing this product with a little bit of Cetaphil moisturizer and I love the result.  It does have an orangey citrus smell, but I am not bothered by it (which is rare). "

The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. 

Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact.

	Their Almond & Aloe Liquid Soap is a boon because it not only cleanses well but moisturizes as it does so.  Far too many soaps leave skin feeling dry and itchy.

	Almond, as we  know, has a lovely distinctive fragrance as well as skin softening properties.  Combine it with aloe which contains healing properties, and you have a uniquely beneficial cleanser.

	Other ingredients include Vitamins A and D for nourishment.  This soap is particularly useful for those who wash their hands frequently during the day and for those with normal to dry or sensitive skin.

	Other items in Caswell-Massey's Almond & Aloe line include Body Balm, Bath Seltzer, Cold Cream Soap, Hand Cream, Hand & Body Emulsion, and Almond Body Splash"

Mills,"Santaquin, Utah USA","About 10 years ago, I began getting ingrown whiskers on my neck from shaving.  Not only did they not feel good (they'd itch, and were sensitive) but they looked horrible. The front of my neck was red, and I would have horrible red and white bumps all over the skin where whiskers would curl and grow back down into the skin.  I was totally self concsious, because it looked horrible.  The only thing I could for the longest time was pluck them with tweezers.  That took a lot of time, and digging into my skin to pull the hairs was very uncomfortable, and really didn't work that well.  I tried switching to an electric razor with little success.  I could not have a close shave on my neck without getting the horrible ingrown hairs.

I searched the web for months to try and find something that would work.  I found some advice for a few different things, but none worked.  I finally ran across a website of a distributor that was selling Tend Skin.  By that point I wasn't sure anything would work, but I was desperate for something, so I bought it.  I am SO glad I did.  It really works when you use it as directed, and you see results by the time you have to shave again.

I apply Tend Skin with a cotton ball or pad to my neck after I shave and dry my face.  I will then apply it again in the evening, and repeat each morning and night.  It does not take much at all.  I always buy the largest bottle for fear that one day Tend Skin will disappear!  If you have ingrown facial hair from shaving, you NEED to get this.  It is the only thing that I have found the works, and I am 100% happy with it.  It is rather pricey, but I never hesitate to buy because it is worth every penny to me.

The only small ""complaint"" I have about it is that it smells just a tad funny to me.  My wife says it smells fine to her, so I don't worry about it.  I wonder if they could make it with a slightly nicer smell - or none at all.  It really doesn't matter, though, because Tend Skin is AWESOME and I don't know what I'd do without it.

I can't speak to how effective it is for ingrown leg hair, etc. but I would imagine it would work the same"

Leis ""yakh262""",Florida United States,"I have used Tend Skin for around three years now for razor bumps on the bikini line. Before I started using it, I had tried everything else and resigned to the fact that I'd always be stuck with bumps along the bikini line. A friend of mine told me about Tend Skin and swore by it, so I bought a small bottle. It seemed like it was expensive, but that first bottle lasted well over 6 months. It does smell like alcohol at first but the smell goes away when it dries. As far as the other reviews on here, I've only had stinging when I used it IMMEDIATELY after shaving...I think b/c the pores were still open from the shower. For me, it's been a skin saver when I'd already given up the search. I hope that the negative reviews on here don't discourage people from trying it. Everyone's skin reacts somewhat differently. Of the millions of bottles of Tend Skin sold every year, I think the half dozen people on here who didn't like it are the few unhappy rarities, not the average who, like me, thank goodness it's around."

It moisturizes really well and I use it every ten days or so. It smells like a weird salad dressing when you put it on, kind of vinegary and spicy, but when you wash it out the scent is toned down a bit. It still smells unusual (spicy and vaguely nutty), but not unpleasant.

I warm a good handful of this in the microwave, put it on my dry hair and tie it in a bun, wait 20 minutes, then shampoo it out using a liquid shampoo and condition with a light conditioner, like Coolaulin or a small amount of American Cream. If you have short hair you probably won't need this deep of a treatment, but for those of us with a lot of hair, or who have damaged or very thick hair, it is great. It makes my hair shiny and tangle-free again.

It doesn't have any of the silicones that commercial conditioners have, so if you are looking for that slick feeling you get from Pantene you won't find it here. But the ingredients in this don't build up in your hair the way silicones do, so for those of us who are making a conscious choice to avoid silicone buildup in our hair, this is a great deep conditioner"

Ever since finding LUSH several months ago, I have not even touched another brand of hair care.

HSuan Wen Hua Hair Treatment is made with fresh ingredients like bananas, avocadoes and fresh olive oil.  

You use this BEFORE you wash your hair, so apply it to DRY hair.  I usually put my hair up in a pony tail and only do the ends because that's where the damage is.  Then I twist my hair up in a bun and rubberband a plastic bag over it.  I try to leave it on as long as I can (overnight if I'm lucky), shampoo my hair and condition like regular after.  Because this is a treatment and not so much a hair conditioner, you still need to use a seperate conditioner.

The results are amazing and my hair is so much softer and in such better condition after use.  Since I only do the ends, it's easy to feel the difference between the ends of my hair that was treated and the rest of my hair that was not.

HSuan Wen Hua Hair Treatment is a M-U-S-T for my hair regime.  Definately recommended"
B000225ZM4:simply_amazing:angelina,B000225ZM4,HSuan Wen Hua Hair Treatment by LUSH: Beauty,beauty,8 of 9,5.0,Simply Amazing,"October 12, 2005",Angelina,"Tulsa, Ok"," This treatment works extremely well!  I looked on here and saw that there were no extrememly helpful reviews, so I decided to write one. I have long, golden, untreated hair. However it was as dry as straw so I decided to try this. Here how it is: the smell is amazing (it smells like pumpkin pie or gingerbread cookies) after use the hair looks soft and shiny, however it makes hair flat. This product is a deep moisturizer therefore the hair does not have any ""pouf"" to it. It is still worth the money though! Rehydration of the hair is supremely important and this rehydrates well. Just after shampooing do not use a conditioner (unless that just doesn't work well for you), which helps the flatness. 

A few helpful tips:
1. This goes on DRY hair
2. After putting lots of this treatment on, try putting a bag over your hair and keeping it shut with a clip. The heat that your head produces allows the hair cuticles to open and fully absorb the treatment. This works 2Xs better than Lush's intstructions (my mother is a hairstylist).
3. Leave the bag tight around your head for 20 to 40 minutes
4. Afterwards shampoo like normal, but I still recommend not using a conditioner for that day.

Hopefully this helps anyone with questions. This really is an amazing product and should be used about twice a month (more if you'd like but that's probably not necessary). Enjoy your beatiful shiny hair!"

I don't have oily skin, but tried some samples over a night serum I was using with avocado oil to mattify it, so my face wouldn't be greasy on my pillow.  It left my skin feeling satiny and smooth.  Avocado is one of the heavier, thicker oils and did wonders for my dry skin, but I hated the feel of it, so finding this was a real bonus to fix that problem.  

Lavender oil also has relaxing aromatherapeutic properties, is a natural antiseptic which helps prevent blemishes, and mosquitoes don't like it, so if you have oily skin and live in a humid climate in the summer, you should try this! 

Note: I have had good luck shopping with L'Occitane through Amazon, but called first to make sure what I was ordering was in stock on their website.  "

Mistral, as I was happy to discover, is also the name of a line of bath and body products, all French inspired, all lusciously lovely from scented soaps to soothing lotions to rejuvenating body butters. 

Matthew Tilker, founder and president of Mistral, utilizes Shea butter, which is an efficacious natural healer, in a myriad of must-have forms. Derived from the nuts of the African Shea Tree (according to sacred custom the nuts are harvested primarily by women), this butter is highly emollient, a boon for those with dry skin, chapped lips, any number of skin irritations. 

The pure Shea Butter soap comes in a plethora of inviting fragrances, all milled six times (while others boast being triple milled). South Seas is a particular favorite - it's as fresh as an ocean breeze and as calming, soothing as a tropical island. The marine scent is accented with a touch of grapefruit, white flowers and soft woods. An irresistible combination. 

South Seas is a fragrance with which you wish to surround yourself - made possible by the shower gel, body lotion, massage bath and body oil, bath salts and candle all available at very accessible prices.

DeWitt,,"I have searched far & wide for a product that aids in the treatment/management of keratosis pilaris (little red bumps on the backs of my arms).  It is estimated that 40-50% of the population has a form of keratosis pilaris and there is no cure for the skin condition.

However, this Neostrata AHA 8 significantly reduced bumps and redness after only 2 weeks.  After 4 weeks, it had almost vanished.  The only drawback is that after 2-3 weeks of non-use the bumps tend to resurface.  But, if you keep the application up, the bumps stay away!  I use it religiously over the summer or if i have any upcoming special occasions where I want to look my best.

I found the product in SELF magazine, suggesting its use for keratosis pilaris management and have nothing but rave reviews!!  Finally, something that works"

After one week of using Murad, I've noticed the scars fading!  I thought nothing on this planet would fade them, but Murad is!  I've also been blessed with good genes in having oily skin.

I am in my early 20's and have had problems with mild breakouts since my teens. I've tried drugstore products, wich never seemed to make any difference, and Proactive which was so harsh it actually burned and made my skin much worse. Murad is gentle enough for me to use twice a day, and has left my skin breakout free! It has also improved the texture and feel of my skin, and makes my pores nearly invisible. I recomend Murad to anyone whose skin is breakout prone but too sensitive for the benzoyle peroxide formulas in other acne products. The only complaint I have about Murad is the price - it can be a little much for a poor college student - but the results are worth it if you can afford it!"
