It is a ""freshen-up"" mist.  I use it everymorning (I shower before bed) before I blowdry my hair and it creates volume and makes my hair look awesome!  It is only short of the full 5 stars because it does not last all day, but it is definitely good for a few hours.  Even after it wears off, my hair is not flat.  It still has enough texture that I can just put my hands through it to get the ""messy"" look.

I don't think that it smells bad.  The smell actually reminds me of some spa products taht I use"

Ressmeyer,,"As a working mom in her mid-forties, I am ever hopeful when it comes to product claims of time savings and beauty enhancement.  And so, when I read about the T3 Tourmaline Ionic Hair Dryer, I just had to have one.  With a price tag of $200, I figured the claims just had to be true.

The T3 is a sleek, beautiful and lighweight hairdrying and styling tool.  With its ionic particle things, it sounds so scientific, too.  But does it do what it says it will do?

For me, it's hard to tell.  It does dry at least as fast as my old 1800 watt hair dryer but with seemingly less heat.  So arguably, it is faster.  Less heat also means less hair damage.  So arguably, that is a beauty enhancement.  Is my hair sleeker and shinier?  Again, hard to tell.  No one at the office the next day seemed to notice any change.

One thing that I do notice, however, is that I like the idea of using an ionic hair dryer.  For whatever reason, I do think it is good for my hair.  And I suppose that in and of itself is enough to make this purchase entirely worthwhile"

This dryer dries my hair in 15 minutes (fully blown under and styled), on top of that my hair is shiny when it's done and not dry.

But somehow it remained somewhere in the corner of my mind and one fine day after getting late for a meeting yet again, I decided to bite the bullet and buy the hairdryer. 

And I tell you, I have never been happier using a hair dryer. My hair started looking better and less damaged in the first few weeks itself. It has become smooth and silky and has a healthy glow.  Though the weight and the time taken were almost similar to my old model, the after effect is worth the price paid. The product does come with a 4-year warranty which is an added advantage to justify the exorbitant price. Though the sales brochures uses a lot of scientific terms like ionic mineral and blah... blah...

I have very fine, bodyless hair that is short and  high- and low-lighted.  I usually use Aquage products because they don't weight my hair down and especially  like the thickening spraygel for body.

Jonathan products smell great.  Additionally, I had no problem with the size of the bottles.  The quantity is probably the same as any other good product.  First the volumizing shampoo:  it lathered just fine and I used only a small amount.  I could feel the volumizing effect right after rinsing, after which I used the volumizing conditioner.  Again, no problem.  I decided to forego the thickening spraygel that I usually use in order to give Dirt an honest try.

I think I need a little more practice with this product since I am not a hairdresser.  I used the smallest amount and my hair was slightly damp.  I also need a haircut at the moment.  Next time I will put it on completely dry hair and apply it from the bottom going up and underneath.  It worked okay, but I need to get used to it.

Cons

Conditioner is really thick and difficult to get out of the bottle. The best solution for this is to let the bottle sit upside down. 

Pros

Smells DAMN good. I'm not a big fan of fruity/coconut aromas, but I like this particular smell so much that I might need to go to rehab sometime in the future. 


Bottom Line: Although this conditioner is difficult to get out of the bottle, it smells really good. Whether or not it will work for your hair, the only way to know is to try it. And even if ot doesn't work for your hair...it's worth the 20 bucks just to open it up and smell it every now and then. =)"

I have very fine, bodyless hair that is short and  high- and low-lighted.  I usually use Aquage products because they don't weight my hair down and especially  like the thickening spraygel for body.

Jonathan products smell great.  Additionally, I had no problem with the size of the bottles.  The quantity is probably the same as any other good product.  First the volumizing shampoo:  it lathered just fine and I used only a small amount.  I could feel the volumizing effect right after rinsing, after which I used the volumizing conditioner.  Again, no problem.  I decided to forego the thickening spraygel that I usually use in order to give Dirt an honest try.

I think I need a little more practice with this product since I am not a hairdresser.  I used the smallest amount and my hair was slightly damp.  I also need a haircut at the moment.  Next time I will put it on completely dry hair and apply it from the bottom going up and underneath.  It worked okay, but I need to get used to it.

Anyone who is that determined to make the best product on the market, obviously will do whatever it takes to make it happen.
After seeing how much the product was, I cringed at the fact that a bottle of shampoo would be that much. I later, literally dragged myself to Sephora to purchase this shampoo/conditioner after knowing that I was willing to take a risk that could eventually end up in my closet.
I bought it, went straight to my bathroom, and washed my hair. The shampoo did not lather, which I expected considering there is no harsh detergents or sodium lauryl sulfate. The conditioner was a very light, thin substance. Definitely not thick. 
Finale-Dried my hair, and right there, I knew that this product is definitely the BEST hair product BY FAR, that I have ever used. My hair, is very damaged, brittle and FULL of split ends. This product made my hair, very very full, FULL of shine, and very soft. My hair was beautiful for days....
Last test.. going to work. As soon as I put my hair down from a pony tail (I'm a waitress), INSTANTLY everyone noticed my hair. They asked ""what did you do?? your hair is soo beautiful"".. I told them ""40 dollar shampoo and conditioner"" WELL WORTH THE COST. Definitely a salon in a bottle. Now my worst fear is that it will be discontinued for any reason.

A thick dime-sized dab is enough for keeping my short haired coiffure in place and de-poofed all day. The trick is to work it in while my hair is moist from the shower but not dripping wet.

Ressmeyer,,"As a working mom in her mid-forties, I am ever hopeful when it comes to product claims of time savings and beauty enhancement.  And so, when I read about the T3 Tourmaline Ionic Hair Dryer, I just had to have one.  With a price tag of $200, I figured the claims just had to be true.

The T3 is a sleek, beautiful and lighweight hairdrying and styling tool.  With its ionic particle things, it sounds so scientific, too.  But does it do what it says it will do?

For me, it's hard to tell.  It does dry at least as fast as my old 1800 watt hair dryer but with seemingly less heat.  So arguably, it is faster.  Less heat also means less hair damage.  So arguably, that is a beauty enhancement.  Is my hair sleeker and shinier?  Again, hard to tell.  No one at the office the next day seemed to notice any change.

One thing that I do notice, however, is that I like the idea of using an ionic hair dryer.  For whatever reason, I do think it is good for my hair.  And I suppose that in and of itself is enough to make this purchase entirely worthwhile"

It has phospholipids which binds water to the skin. Also anti-inflammatories like extract of orange, geranium and lavander.

I recharge my clippers once a week.  The instructions suggest that every 60 days you let the clippers run until the battery runs out.

Although bathing with such Bath Bombs are luxurious, the clean up can be quite messy. (When my husband came into the bathroom while I was bathing, he exclaimed ""What the heck is THAT?!"" Why, it's sunflower petals, my dear...)

I had a first rate mess on my hands after the bath. I had to keep clearing the drain for the water to go down. THEN I had to do it a few more times before I could finally RINSE the tub!

If you don't mind the LUSH Bath Bombs that include petals and other flora and fauna--and you love bright, citrusy scents--you'll likely LOVE Still Life Bath Bomb. It smells heavenly, and tints the water with a golden hue.

However, if you don't like plant parts floating in your bath--nor the clean up involved afterwards--steer clear of Still Life"

The bare Radiance All Over Face Color has too much shimmer for me so I gave that to my daughter.  But the Glee is perfect.  I use this in place of the Warmth and am happier with the color.  Just a different tone to use, especially if you already have a red/ruddy complexion.

Faux Tan All Over Face Color is something I plan on using this summer, perhaps mixing with Glee for a sun kissed look.

I started to use soaps and creams mainly because they provide better value for the money and they help my sensitive skin.

I have always had sensitive skin and shaving never helped. I recently came across Truefitt & Hill Trafalgar and figured that if it was good enough for royalty, then I should give it a try. I can definitely see why this is the official royal shaving cream. It wasn't until I tried this cream and combined it with a Merkur Futur double-edged razor and badger brush that I knew what it was to have a close shave with no razor burn.

Like the previous reviewer said, most people need to realize that very little goes a long way. With just a small dab on a wet badger brush you will be able to create a warm and thick lather that will make you love shaving.

Shaving the old fashioned way will take a bit longer, but it will feel luxurious and the results are much better than anything you can get with a Mach 3 and a can of gel. I can finally go a whole day without shaving. If I go two days, I have a nice 5 o'clock shadow around 8.

This is the best bet for a shave cream. It smells very good and provides more than enough lubrication for a razor to simply glide over. A badger brush is a must though. Truefitt & Hill Trafalgar is simply fantastic."

Swansen,"Jackson Hole, USA","I recently started wet shaving (within the last two months) and have come to regard shaving as something I look forward to now.  I use a Merkur Futura double-edged razor and have bought an assortment of different shaving creams to try, including Prorasso (italian eucalyptus stuff), Taylor of Bond Street (avocado) and the Truefitt & Hill Traflagar.  My top choice is the Trufitt & Hill hands down.

While many people might see the $22 as expensive, most people need to realize that a very little goes a long way.  This is not like the Edge Gel or Barbasol that you learned to shave with.  This just requires a dab on the wet brush (a real badger hair brush) and a swirl in a small bowl sitting in a a bit of hot drawn water to create a warm and thick lather that will make you enjoy shaving again.  I would estimate this jar will last about 6 months.

In looking at the cost of my new shave method (52 blades a year ($0.50 each), two jars of shaving cream a year ($22 each) comes to about $70 a year.  Compare this to a blade every other week and a can of alcohol-based shave gel (which dries your skin) every other month for a cost of $60.  Ten bucks more a year buys a much better shave.

I've noticed that my shaves take a bit longer, but my skin has cleared up of many of the bumps that I used to have.  I also no longer have a 5 o'clock shadow at 3 in the afternoon.  Best of all the shave is the closest thing I've ever had to the shave I got from a barber in Florence, Italy using a steady hand and a scary looking straight blade.

This is the best bet for a shave cream !"

This proved to be totally opposite of my fears, it was light and milky, it sank right in and I didn't feel like I had anything on my hair at all. It was very soft right after I put it on, and it had no scent, I guess you don't want it to keep you up at night!

I have long hair that I dye and highlight whenever Im in the mood, and this product was just what I needed.

It can be used as shampoo, bubble bath, and shower gel.  I've only used it as a shower gel, so that's all I'm able to review here.  As a shower gel, this product is exceptional.  It's an extremely rich and thick gel, and produces a generous lather with abundant bubbles.  I find it to be somewhat moisturizing- it doesn't explicitly moisturize my skin, but it also doesn't dry it out, even in the winter.  In addition, the gel is opaque and creamy, rather than clear, like most shower gel.  The melon daquiri scent is summery and fruity.  It's a pleasant sweet melons scent.  It doesn't smell especially alcoholic; though it's part of Philosophy's line of 3-in-1s meant to smell like fruity cocktails- like margaritas and pina coladas.  The scent is more fruity melon than alcoholic melon.  That said, people who like juicy, fruity scents will likely love this.  

While I haven't tried using this as a bubble bath or shampoo, the rich lather I get from the shower gel suggests to me that it would probably work very well as the other two parts of the 3-in-1.  The one thing that may be problematic for people- the scent doesn't last beyond the shower.  I can't smell it on my skin anymore when I get out of the shower, though the scent is quite strong while in use.  Some people may find that problematic.  I like that it doesn't clash with my perfume, so it's okay for me. "

It was hard to comb my hair even with my wide-toothed comb and for a few minutes I regretted getting it thinking it would stay like this. I tied my hair into a loose ponytail, and wrapped it with a satin scarf for 20 minutes. When I removed the scarf my hair was unbelievably SOFT and smooth! It felt incredible. It absorbed very well into the hair. I was able to comb through it easily. It felt silky but slightly greasy, but that may have been my fault for adding too much. This is an excellent all-natural conditioner and it smells fantastic. Like lemons and mint and garden fresh. The only issues I have with it are that it's very heavy, so on relaxed hair apply it sparingly, or it will get greasy and weighty. This will be great for controlling new growth.

Justice,"Pittsburgh, PA","I'm 28 and have always had what I would call average skin, the kind that most women have. I have normal skin with a little more oiliness in the T-Zone and I get blackheads and the occasional breakout. I have tried all kinds of different product lines (Urban Defense, DDF, Dior, Philosphy, Bliss, etc.) and am the happiest with the results I get from Murad. 
I have been using Murad for about 2 1/2 years now so I have tried a lot of the Murad products and found a routine that works great for me. 

In the morning I use the AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser (love it! the gritiness gives you very smooth surface for applying makeup) then the Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel and the Skin Perfecting Lotion which I mix and apply together so that I don't use as much. Last I put on my Moisture Silk Eye Gel and I'm ready to go.  

At night I use the Clarifying Cleanser followed by the Clarifying Toner, the Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel, the Perfecting Lotion and the best product of all the Night Reform Treatment (see my review of that product for details, I love it!) and again I use the Moisture Silk Eye Gel. 

Once a week I throw in the Exfoliating Fruit Enzyme Mask and I have perfect skin if I stick to the program everyday. My skin looks and feels better than it ever has and people always guess my age to be around 23 so it must be doing something right! 

Top 5 Favorite Murad Products:
1. Soothing Lip Therapy
2. Night Reform Treatment
3. Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel
4. AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser
5. Clarifying Cleanser

Murad Products that I don't like:
1. Day Reform Treatment (too greasy and I hate the smell)
2. Purifying Face Scrub 
3. The products for combination skin - they are ok but the acne line is so mild that people with combination skin will see better results using it. (I have used both product lines)"

It's awesome.  It feels great on your skin, works great, and is so lightweight.  It is so easy to wear under makeup if necessary, and it leaves a flattering look to the skin.  When it first showed up I thought it was an awfully small amount, but then I realized it only takes a tiny, tiny amount to cover your whole face because it's water-light.  So it lasts (at least for me) at least a month with daily use.  In my opinion the only thing they could do to improve this product would be to make it sweat/water-proof, but then it might not feel as good to the skin as it does.

And I honestly am very impressed.  I've always been pretty anal about sunscreen and protection against harmful UV/UVB/Everything else rays.  I've always wanted products with the highest SPF available.  But the problem that I've always run into is that if you want a moisturizer with SPF included, it's usually on SPF 15 or 20...and that is simply not acceptable for me.

Higher SPFs always tended to be much heavier and oilier than I would like, and they caused me to break out frequently - Until Clarins UV Plus!  I am totally in love with this stuff!  It's a tiny tube that will literally last forever!  It has SPF 40 - which is enough protection from practically everything! It has anti-oxidants to fend off pollution.  What more could you ask for.  Yes, it is $35...but keep in mind that you will still need a separate moisturizer.  I use Hope in a Jar on freshly cleansed skin and then I apply my Clarins UV Plus, and I'm good to go.  

Protection is a must in today's world!  UVA/UVB/UV rays are going to bake your skin if you don't do something about it now.  If you're loking for a high quality, high protection product...Look no further"

It helped emphasize my natural wave and eliminated the need to heat-style. Plus, no frizzies! One thing to keep in mind: This is a PRE shampoo treatment, so make sure you use it before you shower and then wash it out. Your hair shouldn't get too greasy if you wash it out. You can also warm a little in your hands and pull through your ends as a hydrating styling product. The smell is a little ""unique,"" not bad exactly, but you can always wash it out with your favorite-smelling shampoo.

So far I've only used the restorative treatment, but after seeing the amazing results it gives, I'm ready to try the whole line.

It smells to me like mocha coffee, and I absolutely LOVE the smell, when I'm using it I run my hands through my hair and sniff them constantly - my husband laughs at me. I do think it's an earthy smell that some people would not like, though. It's kind of like patchouli, you either love it or hate it.

I know the price tag is a bit daunting - but a little does go a long way, so it lasts forever. And it's helping a tribe in Central America to thrive - that helps you feel a little better about spending the money."

It reminds me of glorified coco butter with just a few more ingredients (and coco butter is way cheaper). 

I will use Ojon Restorative Hair Treatment again, but probably only on the weekends when I'm not going to work (because of the oily look).  

The bottom line is, definately smell it first to make sure you like it!  They sell it at Pure Beauty stores, among other places.  And, if you can try it somewhere before you buy it, do it!  Make sure it doesn't give you the ""oily"" look"

I remember my consultation with the Clinique rep like it was yesterday. And therein lies the rub--if you've never used these products and are considering doing so, it is best to visit a Clinique representative to help you decide which products are best for your skin. A lot of times, people do not know what skin type they have or think they have one when it's really another. If you're not using the right ones for your skin type, you won't get the results you need. The Clinique reps can help. Talk to them first and then you can purchase anywhere!

I myself have the combination skin. The Clinique rep warned me that I might have some initial blemishes, and I did, but they tapered off after a week or so. Just out of the shower, or after a long day of who knows what may have gotten on your skin, this is an uplifting, cooling-when-it's-hot, breath of fresh zinginess. Often one all over swipe with this on a cotton ball is not enough--so use the other side of the puff, dab on more clarifying lotion and apply again, and maybe more with another cotton ball till it no longer turns any shade. This is worth it. You are taking off not only the makeup that the facial soap may not have caught, but any impurities that daily activity can attract to the skin--dirty fingers unconciously rubbed over the neck or cheek, etc. Follow up with the Clinique moisturizer that's right for you and your skin will feel five times lighter.

1.	Beauty is only skin deep (read: physical beauty is superficial). 
2.	Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder (read: everyone is beautiful).

If anything my decade and half long stint as stylist and fashion editor has taught me, it is that a) physical beauty might be skin deep but its creation and maintenance is as complex a task as coming up with the theory of relativity b) beauty never lies in the eyes of the beholder...all beauty is about tricking the beholder to feel in a certain kind of way.

So banish all your old worn out mantras about beauty and adopt a new one. Beauty is hard work and Beauty is savvy. The Body Shop Skin Focus Face Illuminator passes both these litmus tests. For starters you are going to save a cool 14 bucks when you add this petite tube to your arsenal and before you scream, ""what about quality?"" let me assure you that a few dabs of this booster boy at the beginning or the end of your day (remember to wash and pat dry your face though) and your face will glow with that fresh faced allure that you last saw only in the black and white scrap books of your grandma.

p.s: Everyone is not born beautiful. I have seen enough. I know. You have to work at it.

p.p.s.:  And if it lightens your conscience any, the delightful gunk in this tiny tube has not been tried out on animals before. You'll be the first person to get a rash. Just kidding!"

It can be too hard to control the applicator, especially if you want to apply under the lower lashes. Since this is a brush on liquid eyeliner, it can't easily be smudged for a smoky look. Of course, the fact that it can't be smudged, once it is dried, is the whole point of this product. It can be cleaned up before it dries, but once it sets, it will stay there until you take it off. When you want to take it off, it comes off very easily, and cleanly, and really doesn't require anything but plain water to remove. I've found that very helpful when I travel.

I've had some success in the past with using straight jojoba and coconut oil on the eczema patches - but not enough to keep up with the hassle of oily spots of skin. I even tried making my own recipes - to some success. But, it was time consuming and I just don't have the time to mess around with kitchen cosmetics for a hobby.
After looking at the reviews for various types of lotions/creams in the Lush line, I decided to give this one a go. I've only been using it for a couple of days, but already my skin is less irritated, and the scaliness seems to be diminishing some. (eczema strikes the top of my feet and a bit of the ankle... makes wearing combat boots a bit annoying when its acting up)
I'll probably need another week or two of steady use to really know if it works as I'm hoping, but so far so good...

The wax kit did come with `Soothing Oil' that is suppose to help, but it's too oily to leave on the skin.

I've been a LUSH fan for a while, and the sales person led me to Dream Cream.  It has really soothing ingredients, like oat milk, olive oil, chamomile, and tea tree oil, so I took a sample home.

I just waxed tonight and put Dream Cream on after.  What a HUGE difference.  There was very minimal redness and no irritated bumps.  I usually get these mosquito-like bumps whenever I wax, but I didn't get any.  The next morning, I couldn't even tell I just waxed my arms because my skin was so ""normal"".

Dream Cream also works great to cut down on red bumps after shaving, and as a soothing lotion for itchy skin.  I will be getting more to use after waxing and shaving.  Definitely worth trying.  It's not LUSH's best selling lotion for no reason"

Since a family member was undergoing both chemotherapy and radiation therapy, I thought I would buy a tub and see if it did indeed relieve the horrid eczema-like patches of skin covering her body. I figured we had nothing to lose; we had tried everything else and had not found anything that worked yet. Being eternal skeptics, I have to say that we were both pleasantly surprised at how well it worked. It immediately relived the burning and itching that often accompanies dry skin. It took a couple of days of liberally applying the lotion 2-4 times a day for the swelling and redness to diminish, but it did finally disappear. I think if you have standard dry skin, applying it this often might make you feel a bit on the greasy side.  I found that it if you have particularly painful dry skin, it helps to keep the tub of Dream Cream in the refrigerator. The coolness of the lotion further augments the relieving properties of the essential oils in the cream. 
	
I would have to say that a little of this cream does go quite a long way.  If you slather a ton of it on at once, it will leave you feeling a bit sticky. An earlier review mentioned that it can leave you feeling greasy if you put it on your face; however, it should be noted that Dream Cream is meant to be used on the hands and body and not meant to be used as a facial moisturizer. 

I would also have to say that the scent is definitely herbal, but the scent (at least for my tub of Dream Cream) was quite subtle.  I did not find it overwhelming. If you are particularly fond of the strong scents that characterize many of Lush's products, then you might be disappointed in this cream. But, if you have dry, itchy, scaly skin, I would strongly recommend this cream.  It is expensive, but it is definitely worth it. "

A friend suggested Clinique and though the oil isn't completely gone...which wouldn't be desireable anyways...it is finally manageable.

I got the DDM lotion as part of the three step program Clinique offers, but I think that the lotion is solely responsible for the changes in my skin.  I could leave or take the toner and soap, which don't seem to be any different than less expensive versions readily available at drugstores.  The lotion though...Wow!  It doesn't go on greasy or watery.  Instead, it has a nice and light consistency that is easy to smooth over your skin but is thick enough that it's not hard to contain or control with your fingertips.  As soon as you rub it in, you notice the mattifying properties.  The lotion actually helps to reduce shine by itself, but without any tightness or by depriving your skin of its moisture.  Some of the stuff I've tried in the past only dried my skin out temporarily and then the oil glands would really start to kick in with a vengence, but with this lotion I haven't had any of those problems.  My skin is now smoother than it's ever been, and the oil glands are apparently appeased as well because I haven't had to wash my face in the middle of the afternoons anymore. "

I prefer the bubble bars because I like bubble baths and also they are more economical as you can break them up and use them for more than one bath, but sometimes throwing a whole bomb in is a treat in itself.

It smells a bit like grape Kool-Aid, but not as sweet or syrupy. The smell is not as strong as some of Lush's other bath bombs, but it is quite pleasant.

The bomb turns the bath water a wonderfully relaxing purple color. As with  most bath bombs from Lush, it will leave a ring around the tub. In order to remedy this, I usually wipe the tub down with my washcloth after I am done with my bath. Granted, this is not the way that one wants to cap off a relaxing bath, but it will save the agony of having to scrub the tub the following morning. 

The bomb turns the water quite soft and will leave your skin feeling delightfully supple. I was quite pleased with this aspect of the bomb. The scent it leaves on your skin is subtle and lasted for a couple of days.  This is definitely one of Lush's more simple bath bombs, but it is definitely not boring. The small surprise that accompanies the bomb somewhat compensates for the lack of glitter and more powerful floral/fruit scent. 

Not one of the more memorable bombs, but really quite pleasing. If you want to take a break from some of Lush's more overpowering products, this bomb is for you."

B0002260I2:candy-scented_lather:lh422,B0002260I2,Rock Star Soap by LUSH: Beauty,beauty,,5.0,Candy-scented lather,"November 13, 2006",LH422,USA,"Rock Star is a creamy pink soap that produces and abundance of lather.  I've found it to be less drying than many other soaps, and less drying than certain of Lush's other soaps (the glycerin ones, like Bohemian and Sea Vegetable.)  While the creaminess is certainly an asset, it also means that the soap melts away quickly, as another reviewer mentioned.  As this is a somewhat expensive soap, more than $7 for about 3 oz., this is definitely something to consider before purchasing.  A bar of this soap lasts me about a week, showering every day.  Admittedly I'm a fairly enthusiastic user, and it's likely possible to use a bit less, but I'm not sure that would make a huge difference.  And this brings us to scent.  If you like sweet, candy-like scents, Rock Star is amazing.  It's very sweet, very pink, and very girly.  Overall, this has a lovely candy scent (the same as Lush's Creamy Candy bubble bar).  It's a bit of a hard scent to explain, but very much sweet and candy-like.  

Overall, this is a lovely, luxurious soap.  It is also an expensive soap.  These are the main benefits/drawbacks.  I gave it 5 stars because I love the scent and texture"

Thankfully LUSH has a solution to every problem and if you like this product, you may also want to try Ne Worry Pas with sweet orange and tangerine. 

Some of my favorite finds include: ""Butterball"" with Ylang Ylang and Vanilla, ""The Happy Pill"" with delicious citrus oils and Bergamot, ""Youki Hi"" with exotic Jasmine and ""Golden Slumbers"" for a lovely sweet sleep. Looking for something romantic? Try ""Romance in a Stone"" with a love poem/note or ""Tisty Tosty"" which is like a love spell so powerful that your true love may even call you when you are in the tub.

""White linen"" is simply wonderful. Am I exaggerating?. I don't think so...

Truth to be told, I didn't buy it for myself: it was a gift. Notwithstanding that, I have gone on buying it ever since that lucky day in which I discovered it. Why?. Well, because I like it, and due to the fact that it goes well with my personality. I know, that seems a strange explanation, but it is the truth. 

This perfume isn't new, in fact EstÃ©e Lauder created it in 1978, coincidently the year in which I was born. All the same, who needs a new perfume, specially when there is a old one that works so well?. This one includes, among other fragances, citrus, peach, jasmine, lilac, rose and amber. The result is unique, and very pleasant.

On the whole, I can say I recommend ""White linen"" for those who can appreciate a subtle but special perfume. If you want more words to describe it, I suppose I will have to look them up in my dictionary. But I guess the best course of action would be trying a sample of ""White linen"": then you will have no doubts of what I am talking about  :)

So cute! That was a nice surprise and I didn't see them while I was taking a bath. I did see the little candy flowers floating about. 

This bath has a high ""cuteness"" factor and if you are in one of those ""everything has to be pink"" moods, then Think Pink may suit your candy mood. Lavender oil, Tonka absolute, vanilla and neroli oil makes this a calming bath that leaves you a little happier. You may enjoy this bath even more with the calming sweet ""Honey I Washed the Kids Sweet Honey Soap"" or the ""Sultana of Soap"" bar which is sumptuously smooth and leaves a fragrance on your skin that lasts all night. 

If you want a pink/vanilla soap, then you may want ""Rock Star."" If you are into mixing and matching according to scents, then the Trichomania is mildly scented with coconut and looks like a vanilla shampoo bar and it goes well with the vanilla scented American Cream conditioner. 

I vote for a tad more vanilla, although you can toss a little vanilla oil in the bath or some vanilla from the kitchen also works well. Eating sugar cookies in the tub is optional.

I found myself with bumps on my cheeks (where my skin was dry), around my nostrils (where my skin was super red and inflammed and raw looking), my nose (oily and prone to blackheads), and my forehead (also oily). I tried several high-end drugstore brands and none of them seemed to work. For months it was this way no matter what I did. I tried Proactiv, which dried my skin out horribly, and stung while I applied the products - I even used those products only every other day and my skin still peeled! I was all set to go to a dermatologist when I decided to give the Philosophy line a chance after hearing so many good things about it from family and friends. 

I've been using it religiously for two weeks, and while I can't say my skin is flawless, it's considerably improved. The bumps have gone down in every area, my nostrils are no longer red and unsightly, no more blackheads, and best of all it feels great while applying and after. Each product also has very little scent to it which I liked as well - no antiseptic smell here! I did find that the moisturizer wasn't quite enough for me so I started using Philosophy's Hope in a Jar for sensitive skin on my cheeks and neck. That and the fact that it cleared up my acne mostly but not completely are my reasons for giving it four stars rather than five.

I've been using this kit for over a week, and I have definitely seen progress.  All of my existing blemishes cleared up much faster than usual, and I haven't seen any significant new breakouts.  

The only downfall is that this is a 4 step program which is a tad time consuming and tedious, but at this point I'm willing to do it if the results continue at this rate.  I also note that I need to put a top layer of moisturiser on my face as the protection creme doesn't do the trick to keep my skin from drying out in certain areas.  Which makes it actually a 5 step process.  

I've had short term success with other products in the past, so I'm only giving 4 stars for the good start. I am reserving judgement on the last star pending long-term results.  If the system continues to work for me I'll re-review"

OK -- so how does this one measure up?  The shades are awsome.  I like Baby Lips and Natural Lips.  It smells ok -- kind of like vasaline -- but only faintly.  Estee Lauder lipstick has a much stronger perfume smell and Lacome tends to smell fruity.  It tastes faintly like a chapstick.  The case is relatively heavy and it clicks.

It was kinda hard to miss since there was this GIGANTIC Poster advertising it. So I thought there's no harm testing it right?? I sprayed a little bit on a test strip and fell IN LOVE with it. It smells amazing!!!! It mainly smells like Lavendar to me which is one of my favorite scent. It lasts for about maybe 4 hours so if you go to school or work you might need 1 or 2 refreshes. I spray about 2 squirts each. Also on the days that you want to try something different I recommand the Pink Sugar by Aquolina and Miracle Intense by Lancome

""Sheer"" is the operative word here - the makeup is subtle, refined and very flattering.

	The stick gloss rates a ten and all A's from me.  What's not to like about a lip treatment that soothes, smooths, plus adds color and fullness?  Stick gloss is a combination of lip balm, lip color, and lip glaze - a three in one winner.

	My favorite colors are Peony, a deep rose, and Poppy, a festive crimson.   When applied each color is much sheerer than the tube color indicates.  For instance, the Peony appears to be a burgundy tone yet on the lips it is a lovely rose.

     Perfect warm weather tones.

I came home at Christmas and had to have a foot taken off the bottom of my hair! (it needed a trimming anyway...but still) I still had two feet of damaged hair left. My mom gave me the Ojon Restorative Hair Treatment to use over my winter break and after just a few times using Ojon, my hair became smooth and silky again. Now I use Ojon about once every three weeks and my hair is in such better shape than it was before! When I use Ojon I usually sleep with it in, then wash it out in the morning. I find that it's most effective that way. I have to admit that the first time I used Ojon the strong smell gave me a headache, but now it doesn't give me headaches at all, in fact, I love the burnt chocolate/coffee smell that is has! I would recommend Ojon to anyone with long and or damaged hair. It is a wonderful product"

     Let's face it, blow drying, hot rollers, curling irons, coloring, the sun all take their toll on even the healthiest of heads.  

     Hair Mask with Shea Butter is both a treat and a treatment for dry, lifeless, lusterless hair.  Shea Butter is, of course, the key ingredient, working its magic to restore lackadaisical locks.  

      It's simple - work a palm size dollop through damp hair and leave on for up to 20 minutes.  Then shampoo and rinse hair well.  I'd also recommend using Fekkai's Apple Cider Clearing Rinse.

Allow it to settle for 5 minutes, and if it works with your body chemistry, you'll know right away. :o)  At first sprtiz, I get a peachy/cedar blast that quickly mellows into a gorgeous, clean, but warm scent.  The vanilla isn't sweet at all.. just warm and inviting.  I have received a lot of compliments on this.

The lasting power is wonderful!  By the end of the day, it can only be sniffed by anyone who gets close to you, but it has developed into a super soft, clean vanilla.

While it is still a fantastic conditioner compared to most on the market, I really thought that the pink one did a better job.  Both leave my hair smooth and relatively healthy, but my hair is honestly gorgeous after using the pink Fekkai conditioner--shiny, bouncy, like I never colored it.  Maybe this one is a little too heavy for my hair?  I haven't quite figured out the difference.  

As previous posters have noted, this does have a rather strong smell--sort of a floral, almond fragrance--which is a little stronger than most hair products.  I didn't find it particually off-putting, but I do prefer the clean, simple fragrance of the pink Fekkai conditioner.

All in all, a great product, but I'll go back to my original Fekkai conditioner when this one runs out.

I have very dry, sensitive skin, and the little Evian spritzers (I carry one with me all the time in the winter) help immeasurably.  I spray a little on before moisturizing, or when my skin is flaking.  I always take these on planes--and spritz my face every two hours--and find that this keeps my skin from drying out and from becoming too oily (in reaction to the dryness) on long flights.

Some reviewers have scoffed at this product, pointing out that it's just water and speculating that the brand name is the draw.  I don't drink Evian water very often (I prefer other brands, if I'm drinking bottled water), and if I could find a comparable product I would definitely try it out.  Similar products, like the Body Shop face mists, tend to be scented and irritate my (very sensitive) skin (the exception to this is the face spritz from the Boots Botanical line, but that is hard to find outside of the UK); I've considered just getting a spray bottle and putting regular water in it, but those tend to have larger, more forceful sprayers and I don't want to point one at my face.

With the Evian brumisateur, you're getting just water, but that's all you need; it's conveniently packaged, lasts a long time for such a small bottle, and I love the way it feels.  Highly reccomended (and thank goodness they're carry-on approved, if you buy the small size!"

This treatment reversed years of damage from my color-treated very long hair after the first use. I love Philosophy products so when I heard about Shear Splendor I didn't hesitate and purchased the entire system. The shampoo and conditioner are the best things I have ever done for my hair. The effects are cumulative and after a few months of continued use, I'm still impressed. I use the Marinating Oil once a week and it's now a ""must have"" for me.  

The ""Marinating"" Oil is not what you might imagine an ""oil"" to be. It penetrates the hair, treats the scalp, smells really good (very subtle) and doesn't feel heavy. It's easy to leave in all night, washes out so quickly and it's instant gratification - beautiful hair. 

Leave it to a great skin care company to apply beneficial treatment properties to hair care.  

This Marinating Oil also multi-tasks for me. I use a tiny bit and rub it into my cuticles and nails.  I use a few drops to tame frizz before I use my flat-iron. I've rubbed a few drops onto my hands and feet when I've felt extra-dry.  This is good stuff!

I highly praise this product.  This is not just another random addition to the confusing mass of hair care lines.  This is serious *treatment* that won't be put on the shelf with the rest of the ""things I've tried"".

It's worth it. I actually love my hair again.  My color lasts longer, doesn't fade, and the shine just won't quit.  It's taken years and years of damage away.

I can blow-dry, flat-iron, curl... without the fry-factor.  

The shampoo and conditioner last forever. A little really does go a long, long way.

Thank you again Philosophy, you've yet to let me down."

Finally, for maxium efficacy, StriVectin-SD must be applied three times a day, every day for 4-6 weeks...StriVectin-SD works, but you have to use it. So unless you're committed to getting rid of stretch marks, don't waste your time, your energy, or your money."" 

After months of thinking about an incredibly large skin care purchase, I splurged and purchased the StriVectin-SD cream. If you have ever gained and lost weight or have been pregnant, then you know that you can get stretch marks and they never seem to go away. How do you heal your skin so they literally disappear? Well, to start with, you need a cream that will produce dramatic results in a short amount of time. Especially as summer is approaching. 

I gave this cream a one-month trial. You need very little because this cream is very concentrated. It seems to increase the skin's thickness and firmness, therefore making the depths of indented surfaces much less apparent. 

Results you should see in 4-6 weeks: 

Decrease in the actual length of the stretch mark 
Decrease in the depth of the indented surfaces 
Increase in skin smoothness, thickness and firmness 

What is actually occurring? 

The cream stimulates glycosaminoglycan and collagen synthesis. It will also correct irregularities in skin coloration. The Peptide solution helps to thicken the skin. 

How often did I apply this? 

Just one to two times a day. At first I tried to apply the cream three times a day, but found it was easier to remember to put this cream on after a shower and/or before bed. It seems to work very well with only two applications a day. 

You may also find yourself using this on your face or on areas where you want to see a decrease in wrinkles. 

Not for use by pregnant or nursing women. Consult with your dermatologist before using this product. Do ask your doctor if this product is right for you and start using it as soon as possible after pregnancy/nursing. You will be amazed at the results after 1 month. My main reason for using this product was due to weight gain and monthly weight gain. It seems to have been very effective and I will continue using the product over the long term for maintenance. 

The ingredient list is long (a proprietary combination of skin firming agents, elasticizers and hydrators) but some of the main ingredients include: Sesame oil, sweet almond oil, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3, Algae Extract, Coneflower Extract, Licorice, Cocoa Butter, Shea Butter, Mango Butter, Peppermint Oil and retinyl Palmitate. 

This product has been clinically proven to dramatically reduce stretch marks and you will find many additional uses for this product. Is it better than Botox? I have never used Botox, but I can say there was a definite reduction in facial wrinkles after a month of use on two main areas of my face. 

What else does this product promise? It will reduce acne scars, burn scars, chicken pox marks and scars from old injuries. If you are looking for even faster results, go to your local esthetician and have a microdermabrasion peel. That will help this product absorb better and you will see even faster results. 

I also just found the Derma E Peptides Plus Double-Action Wrinkle Reverse Creme. It also has the Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3 and is perfect for use on your face if you are allergic to nut oils like almond oil. Once you realize the benefits of this ingredient, you will start to recognize the name in many skin products. 

I would love to see them make this product in an oil-free formula for oily skin or at least a formula you could use all over your face if you have oily skin. Use sparingly and you shouldn't have a problem and it is great for areas of dry skin. 

I now enjoy using this product on my body and the Derma E Peptides Plus product on my face.

While they never really bothered me before, I thought I'd give it a try, with summer around the corner. I'm at just about 3 weeks of use and they are FADING. Literally. While they haven't vanished completely yet, I am quite happy with the results. They have drastically faded so far, and have lost that 'silvery' look of before. They recommend using this product up to 6 weeks and I plan on doing just that. Simple and easy. And guess what? You can even use this product on your face! They make the claim that it's ""Better than Botox"" and I would agree. Something you normally do, like putting on lotion is far healthier, simpler and saner.

Actually, it was better than that - it swept over everything on my skin without depositing powder unevenly. That's rare for a brush. Usually you have to spend some time with a sponge or fingertips blending, but not with this.

The light cream powder, named the 4-in-1 foundation, provides excellent coverage without being thick.  (Thick powder base is terrible - it always looks like you dunked your face in a bowl of flour!) My freckles are still there, but my skintone is more even. This stuff is concealer, foundation, powder, and SPF protection. Awesome. So much easier than doing everything separately! And no oil, talc, alcohol, fragrance, chemical dyes, or preservatives, but what it does have is Vitamin E and Shea Butter. 

The Universal Marble Powder spreads into a tint that looks fairly natural - sun-kissed perhaps. It did need darkening with the darker powder - at least for me. But only a touch.

The Mineral Glow didn't go on as dark as it looked either. I was actually kind of surprised with this one - most dark powders end up everywhere if you try to shade them out...or impressively dark in one location if you don't. This wasn't like that at all, though I think I'd like a darker color for eyeshadow accents.

And some mascara...and eyeliner...and..and..and."

I havent found another moisutrizer that has the same feel as this one- its light and easy to blend and lets your skin breathe so you don't feel ""coated"" in a thick film. I have found that it makes my makeup go on better and more evenly since its absorbs right into the skin and makes it smoother. It truly makes my otherwise dull skin glow! 

I can't really testify to the anti-wrinkle claims because I'm too young to have wrinkles and wear SPF 60 every time I leave the house, but hopefully its working! My only complaint is that it doesn't have a high SPF protection, but I think adding it would totally change the product and make it thicker, thereby negating all its wonderful attributes. Therefore, I HIGHLY recommend using it twice daily (or once if you prefer a different nighttime one) and adding a high SPF on top to prevent skin damage.  "

It leaves you with super soft feeling and ""pampered"" skin, and you can apply makeup rightaway.  As for the promised anti-wrinkle effect, I am not too sure. I think a great deal of the effect is a kind of temporary plumping or masking of wrinkles immediately after application which fades after a couple of hours, especially with makeup on.  But overall, I think it helps keep the skin somehow glowing and I am quite satisfied with this as a nice quality day and night cream for someone my age (slightly younger-looking 37).

B000HGHI9S:mighty_warrior:kasia,B000HGHI9S,The Body Shop Tea Tree Oil Facial Scrub: Beauty,beauty,4 of 5,5.0,Mighty warrior,"March 12, 2007",Kasia,"new york, NY United States","Even though this scrub reminds me of the teenage days, when the skin would act as if it was being attacked by my own face, trying to get away, I still love using it to fight occasional blemishes. There is nothing this mighty warrior cannot do when it comes to cleansing and purging the skin of clogged pores and dry patches. I don't suggest treating the face like a floor, scrubbing away until the polish wears off, but a good scrub at least once a week for normal to oily skin is not only beneficial but also very relaxing and let me just say that the scent itself makes me feel healthier all ready. I still get this, not only because of my fond memories but for it's ability to perk up and refresh my skin, especially before a mask on a Sunday night right before bed. I love the fresh piney scent of the scrub and its creamy consistency marred with real ground tea leaves.

Tea Tree is found in parts of South East Asia, New Zealand and Australia. The small shrub can survive in places where other vegetation fails to flourish. There are over a hundred eighty species of tea tree, only the oil steam-distilled from the single species of Melaleuca alternifolia is used commercially and it's only found in Northern New South Wales. Since it's discovery the oil has been called a first aid kit in a bottle, not used a moisturizer but as a deep cleanser and antiseptic it's also used to treat pimples, burns, stings, toot aches, gum infections and various other unpleasant occurrences.

Without cleansing and scrubs, skin would take twenty five days to wear off, not to mention the daily doses of makeup, pollution, smoke, mixture of sebum and dead skin, dust, dirt that collect on top, they trap the healthy layers and promote patches of redness and irritation, not to mention breakouts and an unhealthy environment for one part of our bodies that represents us so well is definitely a bad idea. Scrubs such as the tea tree oil one are not only natural but also gentle enough not to harm and over strip the skin when used accordingly to the skin type of the user. To get the most of the scrub, a quick steam bath is also very nice; I cover my head with a clean towel and lean over a bowl of hot water with some chamomile tea in it for five minutes. I don't put my face too close to avoid getting my skin burned but it's very relaxing and a great pore opener before the scrub and a mask.

People keep saying that you can cut a bubble bar in half and get plenty of bubbles, but I felt indulgent and I used the entire thing. I don't think I've ever seen so many bubbles in one bath! They stayed until the end. The smell was deliciously sweet, and the water was so soft and silky that afterwards I shaved with no shaving cream or anything. 

This may sound silly, but if someone ever made a bed as soft as those bubbles, I'd want one. I was playing with them, kind of patting them between my hands (which didn't pop them), and I just could not get over how soft they were.

When the water got cold, I just turned the faucet back on and added more hot water. Three times. I had so much trouble dragging myself out of that tub that I thought someone was going to have to come in after me!

I still smell like candy several hours later. I even conditioned my hair with a totally different scent, and my hair definitely smells like the bubble bath.

I'm addicted to Lush now! This month has been really stressful, and I'm getting through it by taking a bath every evening with something Lush. The massage bars are also wonderful"

Probably not for people who want a streamlined beauty routine that can be accomplished fast, but if you like to play... The scrub smells and looks amazing and the vodka/citrus combination definitely helps dry up blemishes.  I have sensitive skin and this has been helpful with once a week usage- any more than that and my skin gets tight and irritated and begins to flake.

One final note of caution: this scrub is serious when it says 'salt', so don't use it on or near broken skin.  Bath & Body Works started using sugar in their scrubs for this reason, but salt has a great effect on clearing up problem skin and tends to help where things aren't seriously broken"

With just a couple strokes of the wand my lashes are *instantly* lengthened and curled -- it's wonderful! Especially since I have STICK-STRAIGHT lashes that you can't even see unless I have mascara on (it's so irritating -_-;;).  

I think my favorite part about this mascara is that not only do you see my lashes but you see my whole eyes! They really pop with this mascara on, which is quite relieving considering I was told that it wouldn't help me unless I curled my lashes beforehand with an eyelash curler.  I'm sure pre-curling would instensify my look, but I honestly don't think it's necessary.  Besides, I like how natural my lashes look with this mascara on -- it really tricks you into believing that you were born with naturally beautiful lashes... it's so subtle yet defined!

They also only seem to serve one purpose, drying out your skin or removing oil. There are some that leave your face feeling nourished and this is one of the healing clay masks. I have sensitive skin with a tendancy towards being either dry or oily - guess it is that lovely combination skin problem. So, this mask seems to deal with both issues at once - removing dry skin and deeply cleansing the pores. 

Mask of Magnaminty is made with Bentonite, water, kaolin, honey, Phaseolus Angularis Seed powder, Evening Primrose seeds, peppermint oil, flower extracts, vanilla fruit extract and a chlorphyllin-Copper complex. 

This is fun to use in the bath or in the shower while you are shaving. Put it on for a few minutes, let it dry slightly and then rub off dead skin cells. The seeds provide the exfoliating power. 

Almost immediately upon looking in the mirror after leaving the tub, I could tell this mask had healing powers. Along with Dreamwash, my skin looked especially cleansed and calmed. I can recommend both to you if you have a need for skin brightening and calming. These two products seemed to work well together to create a radiant complexion. You may also want to try Prince Shaving Cream and the Dream On bath bomb. The Figs and Leaves soap is also very moisturizing. 

~The Rebecca Review 

P.S. If you can find someone to rub this all over your back, 
it feels so good and is easy to wash off by yourself later (unlike some clay masks I've tried). "

The smell is amazing and not too minty or strong.  Like the previous review said below, it smells like mint chocolate chip ice cream.  I put the mask all over my face (you can put it on your neck and back as well), lie down for 15 minutes to get the full spa feel, then wash it off in the shower with warm water.  I find it is much easier in the shower because when the mask dries, it takes some rubbing to get it off.

When the mask is on, your face tingles from the mint and feels so refreshing!  When the mask is rinsed off, your skin feels even better.  Great cleanser and exfoliator in one!

Modern day goddesses can also enjoy the relaxing and cosmetic benefits of herbal bathing, a simple ritual almost forgotten in these tense and hurried times."" ~Burt's Bees Herbal Milk Bath

The hand woven Abaca bag creates a little mystery because you can't quite see all the treats in the bag. What you will find when you open this luxurious Burt's Bees sampler bag is the following surprises: 

A Lavender Mask - Blocks out all the light so you can relax. A delicate and very natural lavender fragrance is subtly relaxing and not overpowering. The silk is quite luxurious and this is a comforting item that will last for years. 

Burt's Bees Pore Refining Mask - Ingredients (they have changed the ingredients to make it work even better than before): French green clay, bentonite, fragrance, peppermint leaf, shavegrass herb, calendula, rosemary leaf and sage. This mask is a lovely avocado green and will make you feel more calm. I loved how the powder can also be mixed with my favorite moisture mask or with natural ingredients for variety. 
I've rarely seen a product clean pores this well. You can simply pour some of the green powder into your hand and mix in a little water. After applying, let dry and then rinse. 

Burt's Bees Royal Jelly Eye CrÃ¨me - A rich eye crÃ¨me that is more like the consistency of a salve. You may be tempted to use this on hands and feet for a little healing luxury. The ingredients are delicious and include apricot kernel oil, aloe, grapefruit extract, royal jelly and vitamin E. Tempting to use as a lip gloss. 

Burt's Bees Moisturizing Herbal Milk Bath - If you were addicted to the Burt's Bees Baby Buttermilk bath, this is a nice grownup alternative. It contains milk powder, buttermilk powder, lavender oil, eucalyptus oil, rosemary oil and peppermint oil. Very relaxing and you may find yourself reading a little longer as you soak away your cares. You may notice your skin being especially healed and moisturized. 

Burt's Bees Calm Balm - A yummy lemon balm made from sweet almond oil, olive oil, beeswax, lemon oil, vitamin E, comfrey root extract, rosemary leaf, lavender, lemongrass oil and lemon verbena. You may start to imagine you are very close to a lemon meringue pie and wonder if you should probably make one. A delicious relaxing scent of lemony bliss. 

Burt's Bees Calming Candle - The tiny candle in this kit is super relaxing and can take you from stressed out to especially calm in a matter of minutes. I tried this candle when I was stressed and it definitely works. Would be a wonderful item to take with you when traveling as it has a lid. 

Burt's Bees Repair Serum - This product supports skin repair and renewal and works to reduce fine lines and wrinkles. Borage and Evening Primrose oils help to promote healthy skin. The oils absorb quickly and soothe and heal the skin. Ingredients: Rosehip seed oil, jojoba oil, lavender oil, vitamin E, evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, wheat germ oil, hazelnut oil, neroli oil, rose oil, calendula extract, green tea extract, beta carotene, tocopherol, vitamin C, vitamin A.

Burt's Bees Shea Butter Hand Repair CrÃ¨me - A luxurious blend of shea butter and cocoa butter, not to mention lavender, calendula, rose oil and rosemary. Not only will this heal and soothe your skin, it is emotionally calming and beautifully scented. 

As a gift, this is filled with healing ingredients that will create a very memorable experience. If you want to sample some of the best of Burt's Bees, it is also an ideal introduction to the world of natural skincare.

After I wash my face and put on my lotion, I put this all over my face (all you need is a little more than a pea, maybe about the amt of toothpaste you'd use).  The key is to WAIT 2 MINUTES!  The first time I used it, I didn't wait, plus I think I used too much, and my makeup went on cakey and wouldn't spread.  So now, after I put it on, I put on my eye makeup while I'm waiting.  Also, I used to use Neutrogena liquid foundation (as I need GOOD coverage), but I didn't have much luck with liquid foundation over The Present, even after waiting 2 minutes.  I bought Philosophy's The Supernatural powder foundation, and it goes over The Present soooo well.  I didn't think a powder foundation would cover my acne well enough, but it does!  Both products together are a little pricey for me, but since I use them EVERY day, it's worth it.
Oh and I have very sensitive skin, hence all the breakouts, but The Present doesn't affect me.

One recommendation.....the directions tell you to wait 2 minutes to allow the product to 'set'.  To get the best finish, especially if applying powder (like I do) or foundation over the primer, you need to wait the full 2 minutes.  This can't be stressed enough."

I was doubtful, but spreading it super-thin worked, plus each bottle lasts a long, long time.

Here are my favorite things about this product:
-Foundation glides on supersmooth
-Fine wrinkles are less visible
-Makeup stays put all day long
-Keeps oily skin shine-free
-Works great as an eyeshadow base to keep it from creasing
-Makes skin feel soft

The one downside is if I don't wash my face at night, I break out, probably because it really is like a ""sealant"" for your face.  Other than that, I love it, and will probably never switch to another base."

Try the Veganese conditioner with this shampoo because it also has a lemony scent and seems to be a nice lightweight conditioner.

'Chocolovers' is the darker, sexier, naughty but nice sister of the sugary 'Pink Sugar'. Sort of like Dannii Minogue to Kylie.

Not as sweet as 'Pink Sugar', when first applied I got the rich aroma of the lemon and orange, combined with coriander, preventing it from being zesty. I could also smell roasted nuts.

After a few hours the vanilla base comes through and mingles with the hazelnut, with the result being a work colleague commenting on the smell of my hot chocolate (no, I didn't have any).

This is a natural facial repair serum from Burt's Bees, and it is excellent for this use.  However, I rarely use it on my face, except at night sometimes, because it is so intense and heavy.  The rest of the time I use it EVERYWHERE else!  I mix it with my overall body moisturizer (which is pure sesame oil) and rub it all over my body.  I use it full strength on my hands.  I use it anywhere on my body that needs attention, healing, moisture.  For special occasions, I use it as an all-over body moisturizer full strength.

I go through probably a bottle a month, so it is ""expensive"", but I enjoy it so much I don't care.  A little goes a long way, but I am using it for so many things. 

The smell is probably my favorite small of any ""beauty"" product.  It is an aromatherapy-type smell, earthy, not perfume-y at all. All of the oils are natural, and blend together to create a perfect lovely fragrance.  It is subtle, but unlike anything else I've tried.

The ingredients are: Rosehip seed oil, jojoba oil, lavender oil, tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E), evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, wheat germ oil, hazelnut oil, neroli oil, rose oil, calendula extract, green tea extract, beta carotene, tocopherol, ascorbyl palmitate (vitamin C), retinyl palmitate (vitamin A).  They are all natural and wonderful!

I like the bottle size too, as it is easy to travel with. At the price, I consider Burt's Bees Repair Serum an affordable luxury that I can't do without!

For my initial shave I set it on ""1"" (least aggressive), and got an absolutely wonderful shave, with no nicks, razor burn, or any discomfort at all.  Even around my jaw line and the point of my chin (notoriously touchy areas) there were no problems whatsoever.

The shave from this razor is so spectacular that I almost get carried away and shave my whole body.

You can get a very good shave without any nicks or cuts if you use proper technique.  Consult the ""Art of Shaving"" for how to prepare your face.  With this razor you should use short strokes and do not apply extra pressure.  Allow the weight of the razor to to do the work, a couple of light strokes is better than one heavy stroke and is much less likely to cut your face.  After shaving with the grain you can re-lather and shave against the grain if desired.  This razor allows you to have more control over your shave, but requires more effort from the user than cartridge razors.  For instance, a cartridge razor will pivot to adjust to your face to some extent.  A safety razor is fixed and therefore you have to change the angle of the blade (by raising or lowering the razor's handle in relation to your face) to accomodate the undulations of your face.  This is less of a pain than it may sound, after you use the razor for a week or two it will become second nature.  I have used it for about two week and have not cut my face since the second shave.  If you follow this technique and keep your face properly lathered you will enjoy a nick free and comfortable shave.

One more thing, you will need to experiment with the ""closeness"" setting of the razor to find what is best for you.  Start with the lowest setting and increase it if necessary. "

The problem with my old razor was that it ALWAYS gave me skin irritation and didn't allow me to shave often enough. With a Safety razor like Merkur's my face gets an easy shave that is smoother than any razor I've used before. My fiance agrees as well. The only problem is that I do take much longer to shave now than I did before. The reason is this: Since there is no lubricating strip on the razors, I have to constantly use more shaving cream to keep the face lubricated if I want to get that perfect shave.

It did a great job of gently cleansing my hair without making it feel like straw afterwards.  Now the scent...  Utterly addictive!  Now I'm not a big fan of mint smells,  but the way this was blended with the other scents is amazing.  You can definitely smell the mint, but it's not by any means overpowering.  Mixed in with the mint is a wonderful fruit scent,  that literally smells ""juicy"".  In the background, very lightly is a touch of herbal.  I happen to HATE anything herbal,  so I was surprised that I even liked this.  The smell is very unique and delicious!

Ok,  all that being said though - it did just as good a job as most any other Lush shampoos (including some of the solids).  I also use their Trichomania and Big and they do the same kind of lovely job Rehab does.  The price just kills me.  I know that real oils, juices and herbs are used, but unfortunately I can't afford to make this item a staple.

LUSH has done it again.  Another great product that is safe (no chemicals, all natural prodcuts) and actually works better then name brand items.  Rehab Shampoo smells great, a really nice citrus smell, and is perfect for damaged (or not) hair.  My hair isn't damaged that much, but I found Rehab to be a great preventative shampoo also.  Washes out very clean and when followed with Retread or American Cream, my hair has never been better.

Like the other review said, LUSH products take some time getting used to because they don't use chemicalls to make your hair 'feel' soft.  They actually use ingredients that help the damage, rather than hide it.  Please keep that in mind when you try their products.  Give it some time before you make a final discision"

I ordered Seanick through their website.

The box arrived today, and I eagerly ripped it open. Seanick arrived wrapped in tissue paper and I could already smell it. It smelled great, not girly, but like the ocean. I was so taken by this that I hopped in the shower to try it out. The bar itself is just like the picture shows--bright blue and studded with seaweed. I could see how some people wouldn't like the ""plants in my hair"" aspect, but I like it. The bar lathered up quickly with lots of bubbles. I actually kind of had fun washing my hair for once. I put a little conditioner on as well, about half of what I normally use. As I towel-dried my hair, it actually squeaked. Pretty clean!

As my hair dried, it was nice and fluffy. Believe it or not, it was actually curlier and my sister said it was a little lighter. All good things. I use a lot of product in my hair, so maybe it cleaned all that off. Anyway, my hair feels silky, shiny, and soft. I even used it as a body soap! What a nerd... 

I love the whole idea behind a solid shampoo and think it would be great to travel with. I highly recommend this to anyone, especially if you have limp and boring hair. My only complaint is that the awesome smell doesn't last.."

This shampoo was wonderful.  Only needed three strokes of the bar down my below-the-shoulder length hair and my hair lathered up really nicely.  Just be sure to keep this shampoo bar (as with all the shampoo bars) out of water when you aren't using it or it will turn into mush.

At the same time, I don't want something that's too "" mature"" and leaving me smelling like an old lady (too strong and musky). Eau Des Merveilles is somewhat of an in-between fragrance that's hard to describe and very unusual. It's woodsy but it has amber, pepper, and  citris notes. It's refreshing, modern, and chic. 
You don't need to overspay this stuff either. It's potent and you'll probably be mistaken for wearing cologne if you overkill it. 

People like how I smell with this fragrance, and some even say that I smell like ""clean laundry,"" which is a good thing (for me atleast). You should try this stuff at sephora or at a fragrance dealer before buying it though. People's body chemistrys ( amount of perspiration, oil production, foods they eat, etc.) can make perfumes smell differently. Spray it on and seell it after a few hours."

From specialty stores to prescription items - I've found a few that do work somewhat.  I depend on conditioners to be the most important product in my hair regime because the conditioner you use has the greatest impact on how your hair turns out that day....trust me - I know.  I've got this hair product thing down to a science.  I used the two Lush products this morning: Big Shampoo and Retread.  Holy **** - what a difference.  I am so happy right now - you should see how good my hair looks today - I used this for the first time this morning and here are some of the key points:

1.  You only have to use a very little bit (I have hair past my shoulders and I only used about 2 teaspoons).

2.  The product smells like Heaven. It's got that affluent expensive natural smell - not that perfumey dimestore smell. 

3.  The frangrance lingers on and on - I've had GUYS tell me how good I smell.

4.  After using with the other product ""Big Shampoo (or Hair)"" - my hair was thick, soft, shiny, silky, with lots of movement - no static. 

5. This conditioner gives me the perfect moisture balance (for my hair anyway - I have very thin, fine, dry hair).

As far as lush overall:

Let me first state that I am in no way affiliated with Lush - I placed an order for over $100 worth of Lush products and this was one of the products in the order. The only negative thing was the shipping turnaround (little over 3 weeks) but when my Lush items came in - I didn't care. The scent of all the products is gorgeous!!! It's made with all natural products that actually smell awesome and last throughout the day. Not too perfumey at all but definitely recognizable to others. I had guys commenting all day on how good I smell!!!!! The packaging is delightful, the product presentation is adorable, and the quality is better than I've EVER experienced. Better than Benefit, better than Philosophy, etc. I buy and try just about every new product line that comes out - some I like some I don't. I can tell you that this line is my new favorite! I'm going to stock up on everything they have because not only do the products work, they are so pretty to look at that I will use them as decorations in my bathroom!!!

Customer service is extremely responsive and doesn't reply with form letters to your concerns and questions. They said they are working to improve their shipping times and were very accomodating. They also gave me some nice coupons with my order!

After use my skin actually has an imrpoved texture and a ""life"" that seemed lacking in the past. Daily use has made a marked difference. Granted, it is not a minor investment, but it just takes a little for comfortable coverage. My guess is this jar will last me many moons!

This cream may be best in the summer months as it is not overly rich once applied. It will work well when you are putting on lighter fabrics like silk or anything where a rich body cream would be a disaster. The secret of this formula seems to be the sesame seed oil and cocoa butter. 

There is something powdery soft about this body cream. It has a ""whispery don't tell"" quality and seems to secretly sink into your skin, leaving only the most delicate hint of sweet cinnamon and faraway ocean breezes. 

The Bathina cream is much more seductive than the body wash, although the two work very well together. You may be amazed at how soft this makes your skin and the scent is delicate enough to allow for the layering of your favorite perfume. I'd recommend the Anna Sui ""Sui Love"" perfume because it seems to have hints of the same whispery floral beauty. 

The small ""to go"" size is probably good for two or three applications. I almost used half the container the first time. I'd go with the larger size even if you are buying the small body wash. I like using the body wash for bubble bath but it would also work well if you are going away for the weekend.

I personally think that this cologne for men is the best on the market. The name itself is attractive, inviting, intriguing and very catching. All the women that I have dated have always been exited with the smell, and at the end of the night they always thanked me by saying "" It's been a great experience and a pleasure, Mr. Pleasures spending the night with you""; they insist on another wild date with me adding that my name and the fragrance have made an impression on them that have resulted in their uncontrollable desires for me! The name of the cologne and my name go very well together bringing out the passion, romanticisms, and animalism with superb ecstasies on kinky dates an experience that they will always treasure claiming what a remarkable man I am. My experience on a tour to South America a few women asked permission to use my name as an advertisement to their exotic full service pleasure agencies; so if your name is not Placeres, try at least the cologne with your mates, and when they complement you, say, Pleasures were made for men and women!

I have tried everything, lots of stuff isn't worth 2 cents and then there's Clinique Pore Refining Lotion. This is a must in my daily routine, I even wear it when I am sleeping. How to use: Wash face, then apply after any serums that you may use, but before moisturizer with sunscreen, primer, concealor or foundation. DO NOT PUT TOO MUCH ON if you are planning on layering makeup on top of it, as it will make your makeup flake off your skin. This is not something that you would smear all over, only on your oily areas (such as nose, chin etc). If you use it on your dry areas, it will make your face look to dry. Nobody wants face dandruff on their black turtleneck. WHAT IT DOES: makes your face appear less oily, reduces the size of pores slightly the first few times you use it, but the pores will get smaller if you use it everyday. It also feels pretty nice when you rub it on (warm and tingly). It does contain salicyclic acid, so it prevents pores from clogging. The size of the tube is huge, it will at least a month or two with daily use. I think this works better than any clean-and-clear product, better than biore pore strips, thus the more expensive price. The only bad thing about this product is that it may dry out your skin if you use it too much and cause flaky skin. One of the other benefits is that it will reduce the amount of oil that your skin produces throughout the day, thus you won't have to blot or powder pat as much as normal"

I don't like to use hair dryers because it is extremely damaging to your hair; with the Acquis, there's less need to because my hair is half dry after a few minutes in it.  Also, I've noticed that my hair has a lot more volume when I dry it with the Aquis.

Not with Phytodefrisant!,"July 9, 2006","claresmom ""claresmom""","Wynnewood, PA","This is my ""Holy Grail"" haircare product -- I could use almost any other shampoo, almost any other conditioner, almost any other hairspray, but I could *not* ever use any other styling product on my hair, now that I've had a chance to use this. There is a Very Good Reason why Phytotherathie's Phytodefrisant has long been a mainstay of top professional models & has been voted the #1 haircare product by readers of ""Allure"" magazine more than once -- try it & if you have frizzy hair I guarantee you'll understand, too.

My hair is thick, naturally wavy/curly & prone to extreme frizziness in the slightest humidity, & I've spent most of my post-pubescent life trying to figure out how to straighten it & control the frizziness. Until I discovered Phytodefrisant, the most effective product I had found was Sebastian's ""Laminates"" (I've tried virtually *every* product promoted to control frizziness that's been on the U.S. market in the last 30 years), but the silicone eventually built up on my hair & on very humid days I had to use so much of it that my hair was weighed down by the coating & felt ""dirty"". It ""looked"" reasonably good (for most of the day), but it certainly didn't feel very good to the touch. However, letting my hair go ""curly"" was a non-starter because the ""curls"" became nothing but frizz unless the humidity was close to 100% & if I used the ""Laminates,"" it only destroyed my hair's ability to curl & simply made my hair look ""dirty"" & unstyled.

By contrast, just a teaspoon of Phytodefrisant allows me to blow-dry my hair to soft, sleek, straight smoothness, with no residue detectible at all to the touch. The first time I used it, what struck me the most was how ""natural"" & ""bouncy"" my hair felt to the touch (I know, I know, I sound like a TV commercial, but this is *really* true!). I could run my fingers through my smooth, straight hair without detecting the slightest residue of the product & even after a month of daily use there is absolutely *no* build up whatsoever. On days when I want to wear my hair ""curly"", a single teaspoon allows my hair to dry naturally into crisp, bouncy curls without the slightest evidence of frizziness all day, no matter the humidity.

My hair is shoulder-length & this tube lasts me for about 6 months, which breaks down to a cost of 13 cents a day. If buying a tube for this price seems daunting, Phyto includes a small travel-size tube in its ""Petites"" travel collection, which would allow you to try a variety of their products & which is also sold here at Amazon.com last time I checked. If you want more reviews from people who take their haircare seriously, check out the numerous rave reviews for Phytodefrisant on makeupalley dot com, where this is one of the highest rated products by a picky demographic group that takes personal care products very, very seriously! ;"

It pays for itself with the first use, and is not only excellent for dry hands but legs and well, just about anywhere you want healed, soft real skin again. I use it on my cuticles after manicures and have instant results there too! I totally recommend it to anyone who just cant get their dry skin to heal and be truly soft.

One of my favorite features is the fact that there is such a wide selection of shades to match virtually any skintone. As recommended on Asianbeautyblog.com for my Asian skintone, I can use C35 and NC35 pretty interchangably - both are yellow based shades, though I find that C35 is more natural looking when used alone because of its golden/olive undertones.

","January 27, 2006","Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","Kenner, LA USA","Instead of indulging in one of those fabulously aromatic concoctions of sugar, cinnamon, flour and white frosting hawked in every airport food court in the country, buy yourself a jar of this whipped body soufflÃ© that accurately mimics the irresistibility of the smell without the worry of all those extra calories or the concern that your friends may think that too much overtime has been accrued rolling out dough at the bakery.

This light emulsion goes on smooth, sinks into the skin within seconds, leaves none of the stickiness attributed to the real deal and converts into an actual perfume with cinnamon notes. Rather than doling out an overdose of cinnamon bun hot from the oven, the initial scent morphs to something light but lingering -- not cloying---you will be soft and feel as delicious and delectable as you smell. 

As I am tempted to apply it more than once a day, my only complaint may be that the jar is too small and will not last as long as I would like.

Nevertheless, Philosophy has come up with a calorie free treat that allows you to have your cake without eating it. 

Recommended to all those who like a fresh light scent that generates a warm feeling of yum.  Not recommended to those who may have extremely sensitive skin as one user that I know complained of a slight rash that appeared after using it on the skin under her arms"

I've often seen people mistaken for having their hair done or losing weight or some other major aesthetic improvement when all they did was have their eyebrows groomed--it's THAT important. THIS product replaces all the brow pencils, powders and brushes of the past and it's all you'll ever need to get those elegant, sophisticated, perfect brows seen on the glamorous actresses of the 40's and 50's films. It may take a few patient practice applications but anyone can become a expert with this product.

This is the product to reach for in the dryness of winter when you are looking for just about anything to calm your scalp and keep in the moisture. The surprising aspect of this conditioning product is how deeply cleansed and nourished your scalp will feel. It also deeply moisturizes your hair like a conditioning treatment. 

One thing about this product is that it is super rich and it may take as many as four shampoos to get this out of your hair. I'd suggest trying this at night in the bath, washing it out twice and then putting your hair up for the night. That way, you don't have to worry about it until the next time you wash your hair the following day. I think of this as a sort of overnight treatment, even though I wash it out right after using it. 

This can be used as a preventative treatment once a week. Almond oil, nettle extract, rosemary, beeswax, papaya, menthol, peppermint, lavender, rose, juniper, salicylic acid make this a winner. I'll be ordering this one again!

After the last two brands I used cancelled my foundation shade I finally broke down and decided I would just have to go with a more expenssive foundation.  I sales clerk at Sephora recomended Vincet Longo to me as the best foundation they carry and I am so glad she did.  I use golden porcelin if I have been in the sun lately and porcelin if I have not.  The coverage is on the sheer side, so it is not heavey or cakey.  Because it is a little bit sheer you could probably wear a shade that is not an exact match and not have that mask look.  Most people can't tell when I am wearing this foundation and when I'm not.  Usually if anyone comments on my skin while I am wearing it it is to complement my skin and ask what cleansers and lotions I have been using. In my oppinion that is the reaction a good foundation should get.  I also love that that it is SPF 15, because as fair as I am my face burns pretty easily.  The dew finish is not shiney like some some dew finishes, just not matte.  Plus it contains ceramide 3, chamomile, vitamins E and C, all of which are supposed to sooth skin, protect it and improve texture.  I was not looking for a water proof foundation, and I have not tried it while swimming so I don't know if it stays on.  I will definatly be buying more Vincent Longo products.  I just hope they don't cancel or change my shades and I have to buy an even more expensive brand of foundation"

With the Clinique compact, it's quick and totally natural looking with great coverage.  I use the sponge in the areas where I need a little bit more coverage and then use a brush for the rest of my face.  It's really great.  My face doesnt look like makeup is caked on.  
But WARNING; if you DO NOT know your color, I recommend going to a couple different department stores and getting consultations about the perfect color for your skin.  When I went to find the color of my compact, I got recommendations ranging from 104 to 116. Some workers really don't know what they're talking about. I ended up buying 106 and this one worker recommended 116, which is a HUGE difference.

It took a little maneuvering to position the stencil at just the right place, but I taped the stencil down and brushed the powder on. Then I did the other eye. I  recommend using the stencils on both sides first and then doing the plucking, because I tried plucking right after removing the stencil on the first side, and I actually overplucked a tiny bit. (I was able to mask the almost indetectable difference in the two sides this morning when I put my makeup on by using just a teeny bit of the brown powder and the wax...I live in Texas and even in the humidity the powder stayed put and did not smudge!) Overall, this is not a snap to use, but definitely worth the effort, and I even got compliments on my brows from my coworkers who thought I had had them done professionally.

I love the finished look- I didn't have a lot to pluck, but now my eyebrows look much neater.  My hair grayed very early in life, and now my stupid brows have gray and white hairs running through them- the powder covers that up nicely.

My only gripe is there is very little information with the kit- just minimal instructions on the back of the small box.  The website had a little more detail, and a few photos.

Great for camping, travelling, bringing to the gym, or just using as an everyday shampoo. To cut down on bringing a whole bag full of bath products to the gym, I use this as a shampoo AND soap, and it works wonderfully for both purposes.

This shampoo leaves my hair FAR less tangled than most shampoos I use, so if you don't often have to use conditioner, you probably won't need it if you use this shampoo! 

The smell, of course, is grand - if you've smelled other karma-scented products from Lush, you'll know this. It's a unisex kind of scent, so I have to fight over it with my husband when we travel. MUCH better than those little bottles of foul-smelling shampoo and bath gel you get at most hotels. The earthy, citrusy smell of lemongrass, orange, lavendar, and pine is a wonderful way to wake up in the morning.

I started using this a couple of days ago and I've noticed a positive difference in my hair. My hair wasn't a total mess using silicone shampoos, but now that I've changed brands I can see the potential my hair had and I didn't even know it. 

I have shoulder length really thick hair with a few waves and curls. I don't have too much of a problem with tangling to begin with. All I needed was a couple of swipes down my hair and this will lather right up. It smells awesome in the shower. Lush describes it as oranges in a bowl of spices; I'm not so sure about that but it definately smells kind of foresty and nice. It rinsed off very well with hot water and I followed with Jungle conditioner. 

Hours later in the day I can stil smell Komba shampoo wafting around my head. It's amazing. I've never had a shampoo stick with me like this and my hair feels light and shiny and just clean. No matter how much I try to clean regular shampoo from my hair it seems to weigh it down. My boyfriend mentioned today my hair looked much less ""poofy"". This is just amazing. 

I would reccomend keeping the shampoo in an airtight container. Keeping it on a shelf where any water will hit it will deteriorate its longevity. I keep mine in a very tiny tupperwear container in the shower. The size of the bar is small, but it will go a loooooong way."

Frankly, if I leave my hair air-dry without doing anything to it, it looks like cave-woman hair!  But not with this stuff!  I towel dried my hair until it was just damp.  Then I sprayed it all over my hair, flipped my head over and scrunched. (If your hair tends to get frizzy, you may want to add a little cream- such as Fekkai glossing cream- as this product doesn't do much to combat frizz)  Then I blow-dryed on low for just a minute or two while scrunching, and let the rest air-dry.  I have a few pieces of hair in the front that is quite damaged from coloring, and the waves weren't that defined there.  But the rest of my hair- wow!

They do work very well together, but you can probably get away with just the shampoo bar. I was amazed at how much fun it was to use the shampoo bars, except you do have to keep them out of the shower or in a shampoo bar tin. 

If you are in love with the Flying Fox shower gel and temple balm, this may be the one you want. The ingredient list is impressive: Hibiscus Extreact, Shea Butter, Camellia Oil, Jojoba Oil, Macadamia Nut Oil, Coconut Butter, Jasmine, Ylang Ylang Oil, Cypress Oil, Palmarosa Oil and even a few little jasmine flowers just for fun. I loved this bar almost as much as Trichomania, also with coconut. 

I'm wondering if having hard water makes a difference when using the shampoo bars. I bought a shower filter and haven't noticed any problems with anything I've tried so far.

I mean, a shampoo/conditioner bar?  I haven't been super impressed with Lush's other solid shampoos or conditioners (at least, not enough to write a review, good or bad), so I was doubtful about this 2-in-1 bar.  But I loved the idea, and I was curious, so I bought it and I must say that Godiva far surpassed my hopes!

My hair is about shoulder length, and it only took about 6 or 7 good swipes on wet hair to work up an incredible lather! (3 or 4 swipes wasn't enough, and 10 was too much!)

My hair felt clean, but not that styrofoam-squeaky clean where *everything* is stripped from your hair.  And the conditioner is light, but doesn't really kick in until your hair dries.  I don't personnally recommend using a hair dryer, so I don't know how that would affect the conditioner, but air drying has worked great for me.

I also recommend it for travel since it's about the size of your palm, is 2-in-1, and won't leak!  

(The only warning I'd give is for the shampoo tin.  I got it for free, so maybe I shouldn't complain, but... let the shampoo bar dry before putting it into the tin!!!  It is a PAIN to get it out if you don't.)

I also LOVE the scent, but could be too strong for some people (or not strong enough).  Everyone is different, but if you don't live near a Lush store, you'll never know until you buy it!  :"

If your idea of heaven is rocking on a sunny veranda with a glass of iced tea in one hand and a good book in the other, a ceiling fan spinning overhead and the heady scent of jasmine filling the air...you will love this product.

Not only does Godiva leave my hair smelling wonderful, it also leaves it shiny and full of body.  Because my hair is very long, I do use some conditioner on the ends of my hair.

I have color-treated otherwise normal hair that is wavy and prone to frizz.  This bar is great because it lasts FOREVER - as i said, I've owned it for a month but it still looks brand new!  A little bit goes a long way...I lather my hands with it (as if I was washing my hands) then distribute evenly throughout my hair.  Lots of lather!!!

The smell is amazing: jasmine mixed with ylang-ylang.  I wouldn't recommend this product to those who don't like strong-smelling products, or to those who don't like essential oil type scents (you know who you are). 

I feel as this shampoo (along with all lush hair products) results in hair that dries quicker.  I reccommend that you blow-dry shortly after washing if you don't drip dry.  

As far as a all in one product, I still use a seperate conditioner - but that's just me, and that goes for all brands.

I was pleased that I could knock off a number of ladies off of my list with one purchase. I was even happier with the free shipping and $30 Amazon gift card offer they had going on at the time. 

I couldn't wait for the package to arrive. I ripped into it as soon as it got to me. The gels were all packed nicely in a sturdy box with handle from Philosophy. I had to restrain myself from keeping all of the gels. I managed to give away nine of them after some agonizing deliberation. (The mint chocolate chip, lemon custard, and berry ones were mine.) Plus the cool box made a perfect container for all of my other gels that I rotate according to season.

I'm a big fan of most of Philosophy's products. They have some awesome smelling shower gels as well as wonderfully working skincare products. I was already familar with the excellent cinnamon buns and double cocoa scents so I figured most of these should be pretty darn good too. The mint chocolate chip is nice but the lemon custard is weaker smelling out of the bottle. As with all of their 3-in-1s,Oh well, some will be a hit where as others will miss.

As with all of their 3-in-1s, the shower gel makes mounds of lather, cleans your skin usually without drying, and works fairly well as a shampoo too - though conditioner is typically needed.

Munro ""nyc girl at heart""",south,"Okay, so 80 bucks seems like a lot of money to plunk down for an at-home microdermabrasion kit...especially when everyone from Homedics to L 'Oreal is marketing a more cost-friendly version of what appears to be the same EXACT thing.  However, experience (and lots of money not-so-well spent) has taught me that, in most cases, you generally get what you pay for.  Case in point: a few months ago I finally made the decision to trade in my 99 cent ultra-black mascara for a high-end name brand version of the same product...I immediately discovered that mascara-induced racoon eyes really can be avoided!  Who knew?  After that, I vowed never to pinch pennies when it comes to beauty.  Now there are, of course, some exceptions; my mother swears by Oil of Olay -as do I- but when you're talking about microderabrasion, a proceedure that can cost as much as $150 per session, it's hard to believe that you can achieve the same exact results with something that is a mere fraction of the cost.

Skeptical but desperate for youthful looking skin, I opted to splurge on the DermaNew Facial Rejuvenation System.  Prior to my purchase, I did a fair amount of research so I knew that what I was getting the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of the more than twenty-plus versions that I had to choose from.  

Just two weeks after using it, I began to notice that my once sallow complexion (thanks to stress, lack of sleep and yo-yo dieting) had been replaced with a healthy glow.  Now my skin looks soft and peachy, kind of like it did when I was twelve...you know, when youth and beauty was effortless...sigh!  

All in all this product is best for someone with little to no skin flaws.  Those who are expecting miracle results or results similar to what you would get from a full-service salon treatment may be dissapointed.  My advice, shell out the necessary funds in order to get your skin under control, then use this product for the upkeep.  This is great for removing the dead skin that regular washing tends to leave behind. "

You pop a sponge on top of the applicator, put cream on it and apply to your dampened skin. I set a timer for 3 minutes and work the applicator around the surface of my skin. 

The results are great! Dead skin is sloughed off, circulation is stimulated and the results are glowing soft skin.
My skin looks lovely and feels smooth to the touch. It felt soft and wonderful after the very first application!

Dermanew sells other applicator sponges and creams separately to use with the applicator tool on your hands and feet.

To those of you worried that your boss may think you spent your lunch break in a pub - the stout scent fades quick and is only really identifyable while washing.  

A word to the wise, this shampoo is a bit drying.  I make sure to deep condition at least once a week to avoid crispy hair. "

	Notes include Calabrian bergamot, neroli, and the zest of green tangerine, each warming and giving vitality to the fragrance.

	Mr. Armani has said that the inspiration for this scent came from the shoreline of Pantelleria island, a body of land which lies in the Mediterranean Sea between Sicily and Tunisia.   Pantelleria is one of a kind, a rarity as is Acqua Di Gio.

I have found that combination products do not work well on my dry curly hair, so I cannot attest to the hair cleaning properties of this product.  I can say that I've been using Philosphy products on my skin for about a year, and I love them.  I have found that my skin has been slightly less dry since I switched from my old product.

I (and I've heard many others say this same thing) have found that the fragrance does not linger strongly on your skin after your shower.

It is very versatile and  not too strong in its fragrance. However, the scent doesn't last very long and you may have to spray a few more times than usual to achieve results that will last to your hoping.

'Touch' is the first cologne Burberry has designed that leans towards a ""sour"" smell but in this case, it works. 'Touch' is very romantic, elegant, provocative, and sensational all at once...but its effects are only minimal. Maybe if it were redesigned to produce long-lasting results then I would probably add the 5th star to this rating but unfortunately, the scene span of 'Touch' can only leave me wishing."

You will notice a difference in the tightness of the skin of your neck right after the first application.  Subsequent ones will just make a good thing even better.

Clarins has been a leader in beauty products for years now and they have been my favorite brand since I discovered them in my early twenties.

Ball,"Iowa City, IA","This is a great little lip gloss collection - all of the LOLA lip gloss colors in mini bottles. While kind of pricey, I love it since I can never make up my mind and would have a hard time shelling out $16 for something I might not wear. I love these glosses, they're light, tasteless-to-slightly-minty, long-lasting and relatively non-sticky (as far as glosses go - I'm a very low-makeup girl, so the fact that I can wear these without getting my hair glued to my lips is a big plus!) One caveat: this is a sampler - these are TINY bottles (each roughly the size of my pinkie), but that can be a bonus if you want something to slip in the smallest pocket or purse. I've now bought two of my favorites (celestial and rush) in the full-size version for daily wear, which lets me save the mini versions for days I need something tiny, and the rest aren't colors I'll wear every day, but I love the option when I want something different."

The refreshingly light peppermint taste is very pleasant, and is not overpowering at all. Although it has a hefty price tag, the Menagerie is very much worth it. These make cute gifts as well, and almost every girl will love the convinient sizing, as well as the super shine it emits. It's not sticky at all. I love it"

Softer feet here I come!,"January 5, 2007",Robin,Beautiful Colorado,"I usually wear the socks with the cream for 2 to 3 hours. I've had them since Christmas and have used them twice a week and after only 4 treatments (using the softening sock salve), my heels are SO much smoother and softer! I had really deep cracks in my heels with sharp chunks poking out - even using a heel file didn't help! But these things are already showing drastic improvement!  The only part that's hard for me is soaking my feet first, so I usually do it in the morning after my shower.  {Another nice benefit of being a stay at home mom ;-)}

My box lists step by step instructions including how to hand wash them. After 4 uses (2-3 hours as stated previously) I feel no need to wash these - my feet do NOT sweat in them.  I've even worn a pair of slipper socks over them to help keep them clean when I walked around the house (careful with that one - they're pretty slick when you first put them on with the softening sock salve!) and my feet still didn't sweat.

I DO recommend using the softening sock salve with them for faster results. 

I hope everyone is as happy with these as I am"

Elkins ""his wife""","Waynesburg, KY, USA","I received a smaple size of this face creme with my recent order of my hunny's anniversary present from Estee Lauder. It came with a bunch of other stuff that I either swapped or gave away, but this was a real winner for me. It came as a 5-day supply, and I just wish I had more. 

I used this creme as a supplement to other lotions I wasn't thrilled with, namely, Neutrogena Whip Moisturizer with SPF 15 or 30, and Clinique Super City Block SPF 40(but I'm still undecided about this one). Both of these weren't smooth enough. they didn't have that nice slip to spread easily across the skin. The former I had to use a lot of on its owen to really moisturize the lower half of my face, and the latter I had to rub very hard in order to get it to spread without this creme. 

I love that this creme gets the job done. Out of all the moisturizers I have used for my face, I have had to use this one the most sparingly in order to moisturize, and I like that. I can imagine it coests more than the other two moisturizers, but it also does a better job. 

I don't like that when I first put it on, it seems to warm up my face a bit around the nose and mouth. Ordinarily this wouldn't bother me, but seeing as to how almost every other thing has been breaking me out recently, it makes me a teensy bit paranoid. Howver, this sensation does not persist, so I don't worry too much about it. The other thing is that it takes alittle longer to sink into the skin, and until it does, it gives my skin the look as if I have been sweating, but then it's in and my skin just feels good. 

Isn't that what moisture is all about?

Immediately, I liked the thinner-sized tube (can't stand those overly fat mascaras!) and the stiff-bristled brush. The product is a bit on the dry side, but I much prefer that to wet and gloppy. There wasn't too much product on the brush, and it was easy to apply. I definitely noticed a lengthening effect beyond what I've seen with any other mascara, which was great because it made my small eyes look much more open. Also, the product stayed put all day long, absolutely no smudging or flaking. My only slight disappointment was that it left my lashes looking a bit thin, as the effect is long and spidery; I guess I'm used to the fullness I get from my everyday mascara, Full and Soft.  I will continue to use Definicils for times when I particularly want more length, and I've found that I can layer it with my Full and Soft to get both the length and fullness I want.  I would repurchase this if I could get it for a discount again, but I would not pay full price"

I was in the gym last week, and I went into the locker room to wash my hands after my workout. I opened the door and was immediately startled by an amazing scent -- unlike anything I had encountered before. Someone's perfume? I wondered. But it was so different! I wondered whether the person was still in the locker room. I was at the sink when I saw someone walking around by the back wall. I couldn't help myself from what happened next, even though I knew I would sound like a freak: ""Is that your perfume I smell?"" I asked her. ""Yes,"" she replied pensively, probably thinking I was going to complain about someone using perfume in the locker room. ""WHAT IS IT?? It's the most wonderful thing I have ever smelled,"" I said. ""Burberry Weekend,"" she replied, as her face melted into the the confident, self-satisfactory smile of a woman who knows she has something another woman wants. 

I excitedly told my husband what happened that day, and I am hoping he will buy me some of this incredible fragrance for Christmas."

Allure gave the Neutrogena product a great review.  I like it because like this product, it gives an instant color while also including the chemical that develops a tan over the hours.  However, I have been having to bleach my bath towels to get out the leftover mousse on my legs after I get out of the shower at night (If I don't it gets on my sheets.)  Also, you have to work quickly with your hands to spread the mousse before it streaks. Then you have to clean it from your fingernails.

I tried this Modelco spray at Sephora today.  It goes on very evenly, no hand blending needed.  It is lighter than the medium Neutrogena, which is great bec I am very fair skinned.  Much easier to apply, but costs a lot more.  I'll prob use it on weekends because you can spray all those hard to reach areas.  During the week when I'm just doing my legs I'll  stick to the cheaper Neutrogena product."

I'm on my third bottle which my mother thankfully supplied me at Christmas this year. Brit has a deep, warm vanilla amber scent, but it is not sweet.

Great for traveling or simply displaying in the bathroom, these little gems make me happy in the morning when an extra ompf is needed to get me out of my warm bed and under cold water!

My favorite so far is the Mango, and in all honesty I don't like to eat the fruit raw, but I love it in mixed recipes and in bath and body products.

Each wash is 2 oz. and enough for a few uses, making it fun to do a switcheroo every time I hop in the shower. The scents are Tropical Mango, Coconut, Passionfruit, Strawberry, and Satsuma.

Mango is lovely, slightly tangy and bitter , like a grapefruit but with a velvety sweet scent that is a pleasure to use. This is a gel.

Coconut is another favorite, creamy and juicy, like real coconut milk, not overly sweet but pure and authentic smelling. This is a creamy wash, not a gel.

Passionfruit is refreshing, green and purple at the same time, smells like a mixture of kiwis, lemons and melon,  a contrast of tart and sweet succulence.

Strawberry is not bad but has a hint of plastic in it, it's not the truest flavor I came across, but it seems pretty hard to fabricate, since the fruit itself is slightly sour and delicate. For a shower gel its fine, but if this was a flavored food product I'd probably skip it. This comes in the gel form.

Satsuma is crazy, a sugary tropical warm orange like hot flavor that turns my bathroom into a wicked retreat from reality. Very strong and pungent but fun when I'm in the mood for intense tropical experience. This comes in the gel form.

Overall I have nothing but praise, although the price is a bit high, but the whole set is a fun way to try out all the flavors and makes a great gift, it also lookS beautiful in the see through container, like a carousel of colors waiting to be enjoyed.

The scent is kind of musky/spicy, and we like it.   It doesn't overwhelm, but is quite pleasant. (the scent is not as pleasant with heating implements) I don't think it would be good for daily use because it would probably get very heavy and greasy (it has beeswax, and multiple oils).

It's a very natural and beautiful shade.  It is sheer as the name implies, but there is still a good amount of color.  The smell is pleasant and sweet, with a smooth and light texture.  It has the coverage of a lipstick and the moisture of a gloss, without being sticky. It's kind of like a tinted lip balm, but the color is more substantial.  It actually feels better on my lips than a balm.  The appearance is semi-glossy, but not goopy looking like a traditional gloss. There is a little bit of sparkle, but it's not chunky like glitter.  I would prefer it not to have any sparkle at all, which is my only complaint (and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5).  I think the formula is shiny enough that it doesn't need any added glimmer effect.  Honestly, I think cosmetics manufacturers have gone overboard with putting glitter in virtually everything.  Enough already!  Anyway, I still like this lipstick despite my sparkle hang-up.  It is packaged in a slim silver tube that is very chic, simple, and easy to apply."

It doesn't lighten hair very dramatically at all on its own, but it conditions very well and smells really nice, like a lemony custard.

I use this by warming it slightly in the microwave so it sinks in better, then applying it to dry hair. I tie my hair into a bun and wait twenty minutes or so, then rinse it gently, wash my hair using The Blonde shampoo, and condition with a light conditioner.

If you don't really want your hair lightened much and just want a bit of extra shine and highlight to your blonde hair, this is great on its own. If you want a more dramatic effect, The Blonde solid conditioner works for a stronger effect. The Blonde can be drying though so I do like to use them together"

I knew this was a product that would become a beauty staple around my house. I have since purchased several other items from Fresh, especially from their skincare, bodycare and fragrance lines. I find that Fresh Soy Formula f21c Face Cleanser is one of their best products. And the price is right, especially given the cost of some of the high quality face cleansers on the market.

This unique face cleansing gel is fabulous. The texture is somewhat unusual. It is a clear gel and feels very slippery when applied. The gel foams, ever-so-slightly, almost like a lotion,  and feels great on dry skin. The face cleanser does an excellent job of removing makeup and leaving the skin soft, comfortably clean and glowing. It also tones the skin, revives the eyelid area and conditions the eyelashes in the process. What could be better? And all in one single product! 

For the winter months, this is a perfect compromise between the fresh, clean feeling of a gel and the comfortable, soothing feeling of a lotion. It is my normal-to-dry skin's new favorite cleanser. Soy Face Cleanser contains rose extract, cornflower extract, glycerin, mallow extract, chamomile extract, ginseng, aloe, soybean powder, soybean protein, borage seed oil, cucumber extract, vitamin A, vitamin E and gentle cleansing agents.

Each product has a certain Earthy quality it and its nice knowing that people who make each an every single on of these luscious concoctions love them as much as the customers do and it shows!

The Karma soap looks like a slab of gold in shape but is really reminiscent of candied carrots I would find in fruit cakes I used to eat as a kid growing up in Poland. The clarity of the fiery jewel like color is quite attractive as it makes for a nice soap to put in the guest bathroom or for self spoiling with hand made soaps that beat the other cookie cutter types by a mile. The scent itself is a breezy breath of citrus with mother earth embedded deep in the core. The lavender and patchouli are a whisper, a shadowy backbone to the zest and freshness. The multidimensionality of layering scents makes fore a very uplifting experience and I can smell the heady aromas every time I was my hands with it. I also love the Karma perfume, which smells almost exactly as the soap.

I find that my hands don't get as dry when I use this glycerin soap as opposed to regular soaps laden with chemicals and lards. But I always use a hand cream afterwards, preferably one of those gooey Burt's Bees creams that come in heavy glass jars. My hands never crack or get dry no matter how dry the air or how cold it is when I used Lush soaps and a good hand cream.

This cologne can be described as a superstarter to one's eventful day, either at home whiling away time or when outside conquering the world.

It's funny and loveable how Amazon describes this fragrance by correlating it to British Men.("" Epitomizing the modern, British man, Brit For Men captures a relaxed elegance and effortless style."") I must say it makes me feel confident.

Schneider,,"This cologne is very spicy and is perhaps one of my favorites next to Burberry Fragrance for men. Whereas Burberry Fragrance was fruity, Brit is slightly different in that the scent is more floral and certainly more spicy (and yet not as heavy or as complex as London).

For something as spicy I'm quite surprised with how light this one comes across (in comparison with London which was just a little too heavy for me). I have to agree with other reviewers and say that it's still by far very masculine indeed. Vanilla is immediately noticed, as well as more fruity undertones which only increase as time passes (""juicy green mandarin,"" perhaps but you need to be a poet to sense it... again, admittedly sweet). Warning, this product is not nearly as citrus/lemon/orange the Burberry Fragrance; instead it follows in London's footsteps and provides spiciness in yet a more minimal way.

Can be worn in a similar fashion, either for formal affairs or casual ones, though I'd gather it is selected most often for casual ones (I did find a similarity between this and Chanel's Allure, and yet I find Allure much more pungent... I love Allure, but if you want something a little more mellow for the night, this is your product).

Sweet, spicy, deep and complex Brit marks itself as my second favorite from the Burberry line - sharing the spot right on top with the Burberry Fragrance! Can be worn daily without becoming tiring, a feature which I think it holds over Burberry Fragrance whose citrus-sweet Fragrance may become an annoyance"

It doesn't sink in anywhere near as quickly as Dream Cream or Skin Sin (or the now- discontinued Potion), but it works wonderfully for chronically dry skin. 

I apply it in a thin layer after a shower or bath in the morning and the moisture thins it out so it sinks in right away, and a thicker layer at night so it can sink in fully while I sleep.

The lotion works perfectly, but honestly, I buy it for the scent. It isn't often you can find such a naturally scented vanilla lotion. The banana is so light you can barely smell it, but gives an overall feeling of an ice-creamk or lovely dessert scent, rich and delicious.

I have a problem with most synthetic scents changing on my skin, and so I am pleased that Lush relies so heavily on natural plant essences and infusions."

The lotion smelt wonderful, but when I used it, my hands felt like the lotion didn't really sink it.  Sympathy for the Skin left a slight shinny coat on my hands and felt a little oily.  At first I realized that I was using too much, so I started to use less and that really cut back on the oiliness.  Since I use this at night time, it's not that big of a deal, but I wouldn't use this as a day cream because it's a little to heavy for me.

Besides the oiliness, the lotion did work well and really helped to moisturize my hands, which are usually dry and cracked because of so much dishwashing.  I follow with LUSH's Lemony Flutter Cuticle Butter and my hands have never looked better.

Hmmmmm, seems to me that consolation, condolences and commiseration should be extended to those who don't have a small tub of this at the ready.  They probably have to put up with dry, tight-feeling skin crying for a kind word or, better yet, a moisturizing body lotion.

Truth be told,  skin needs our utmost attention - summer, winter, springtime and fall.  In the cold months it's buried under so much warm clothing that it can't breathe or dehydrated by central heating.  In the warm months it's parched by the sun and blown dry by air conditioning.  Yet, it stays with us.

When we're having fun, our skin is not.  Did you have a ball dancing all night?   Think of how those tired tootsies feel in the morning.  Were you the belle of the beach playing volleyball in your teeny-weeny bikini?  Too much sun, eh?  Your skin took it not only on the chin but all over your toned bod.  It needs TLC.

""Sympathy for the Skin"" is a rich, soothing potion of a lotion laced with healing ingredients such as Almond Oil, Cocoa Butter, Sandalwood Oil, Fresh Bananas.    Creamy in appearance it's a luxurious emollient that is absorbed quickly by your grateful skin and leaves a lovely subtle scent of vanilla.

There are those days when I must have a soothing hot bath, which I know depletes skin of moisture.  So, after bathing I simply pat skin with a towel and then smooth on ""Sympathy for the Skin"" while skin is still damp.  Works wonders!  That's what's known as having your soak and silky skin, too"

I had acne as a teenager and I also have larger pores. The scars have diminished (not completely, mind you!) and my pores are much smaller. I also have sensitive skin and this system does not irritate my skin. My skin also tends to be flaky when irritated and the idealist system had taken care of the problem. My advice is that you must use the Idealist in the morning and at night for your skin to get the total benefit of the micro-d product. I tried using the Idealist only at night and the benefits were not as great. It's expensive, but worth it. By the way, I have been using the .5 oz. sample size of the micro-d and I still have plenty left after about 5 uses. So this stuff will last you a very long time. You only have to use it twice a week (use it any more and it will irritate your skin). 

The first time you use it, you may be a little uncomfortable as there is a definite warming sensation. It also felt a little uncomfortable and made my skin a little pink, but it subsided very quickly and it was all worth it in the end.

Many rose oils are reminiscent of a rose garden. This rose oil reminds me of a wild rose bush you would find in a cedar forest. There is a hint of comforting cedar wood with varied elements of fragrance not unlike a fine perfume. Spicy notes mingle with sweet rose perfection while delicate high points capture your attention. Of all the rose oils, this one has numerous elements to lift your mood and scent everything from bath products to laundry soaps. The highly concentrated oil will last for a long time. One drop of this in a spray bottle of spring or mineral water and you have a beautifully scented skin refresher. Put a drop on a  cloth and toss it in the dryer for rose scented towels. Add to your fabric softener or drop the tiniest amount on a card you are sending to a friend. 

The sheer value of this product is astounding when you consider how expensive rose oil can be. The high concentration is superior to all other rose oils I've tried and this is very affordable. In this case, you seem to get more than you paid for. If you are looking to add rose oil to your collection, this is the best one I've found for blending with other oils and making bath products and scenting products I use around the house. 

This oil will bring a poetic beauty to your life and can alleviate times of emotional upheaval. Use for dry skin (add to creams), addictive behavior, anger, despair, depression, grief, nervous anxiety, heart problems, emotional fatigue, irritability and insomnia. Since this is highly concentrated, you may want to blend it with jojoba oil first before mixing into beauty products. 

Caswell-Massey also sells a divine Egyptian Musk, Ylang Ylang and Lilac oil. Very affordable oils and unlike other brands were you have to almost pour the oils in the tub, a few drops will do. Highly Recommended.

The lipstick goes on as shiny as lipgloss but has the texture of lip balm. The colors, though sheer, still have good pigmentation; the sheerness is actually a benefit because it allows the lipstick color to blend well with your natural lip color, lessening the chance that your lip color will come out looking unnatural. The Aqualumiere line of lipsticks do need to be reapplied more often than a less sheer lipstick, but the lasting power is still relatively high, and reapplication is less of a bother because of the lipstick's texture.

The main natural ingredients are lovely and include: Water, Lavender, Honeysuckle, Marigold, Grape Juice, Rosemary Oil, Thyme Oil, Lavender Oil and Rosebuds. I found the fragrance to be very elegant, like walking through a field of lavender along a paved path in high heels by the light of the moon in a chiffon gown.

I always dreaded shaving after a hunting or fishing trip. Even the old Gillette twist-open requires that it be partially opened to properly rinse out the cream and whisker sludge. This guy has a nice round cavity underneath each cutting edge that allows water to wash everything away. Even shaking it in a bowl will clear it most of the time. If it should clog, one can blow it out quite easily. I have only used the lower settings, and they are all I seem to need with good blades. The Gillette blades sold in the US are horrible, BTW. Use Merkur blades or Swedish Gillettes for the best shave.

My only complaint is that the alignment marks to match up the top and body are faint, and the adjustment marks do not line up properly, and I am forced to do math to get repeatability. I have higher expectations for German engineering and the price.

This thing is overpriced for what it is, but a good shave is worth a lot, and you only buy it once"

One of those is Hypnose and I really like it for when I go out or just looking for that dramatic look.

Postive:
1.) The look: I've never neccessarily wanted to wear fake eyelashes but they do look almost perfect. Unbelievably, Hypnose gives you that look. It's amazing just how feathery your eyelashes look.
2.) Flaking: This mascara never really flaked on the bottom of my eyes. That's really important to me.

Negative:
1.) This mascara starts out great but after about two and a half weeks it starts emptying out on you. This might just be because there were days when I reapplyed it or simply because I just used it pretty well (1 coat just about everyday because of how much I liked it).

Summary: If you want that natural yet ""are those real lashes?!"" look, then you'll like this mascara. I'm giving it four stars instead of five simply because of how long it lasts but if you use it once it a while, then it will last you a while"

Solid shampoos can be intimidating if you have never used them before, but LUSH makes the experience fun and easy.

A solid shampoo is also good for travel, as it doesn't spill or explode all over your luggage"

Although, an initial coloring with Henna may be recommended, this extends the color and shine and can make your hair feel like it has more body and bounce. 

This is super fun to use in the tub and really works up a lather in your hair that is rich and moisturizing. Rhassoul mud conditions the scalp while Persian Henna gives you color. The scent is like an earthy apple cider with hints of orange and rosemary. Dry this bar out between uses by keeping it in a soap container. 

What I noticed most after the first use was how long my hairstyle lasted and how my hair had that ""whish, whish"" super clean feel. I also noticed a deepening of the color. If you have oily hair, this is a deep cleansing shampoo that will give you a lot more body along with the shine. Follow with a rich conditioner like LUSH American Cream or the earthy Jungle bar. 

Why are shampoo bars so much fun? This one definitely makes my lush favorites list. If you used one of the lemony shampoos (I Love Juicy) and it took out some of the color, this seems to work well to restore the color.

For heaven knows how long I've been distributing conditioner throughout my hair with my fingers, massaging it in, thinking I was doing a thorough job. Not so! After using this Fekkai Detangling Comb the difference was amazing. Obviously, the mere use of fingers had not been able to release the conditioner as it should have been. 

The comb is handcrafted in France with wide teeth, smoothly rounded to protect hair. It's a beauty on its own, as you can see. It allows easy distribution of the product whether it's a conditioner or a treatment mask. It's a breeze to use in the shower and also ideal for comb-outs. 

Frederic recommends applying a conditioning treatment 1-2 times a week to maintain healthy hair. To date, I've been very well pleased with all of Frederic's products and his advice. This is a man who knows hair and how to care for it.

Hawkins ""Laura Wilde""",USA,"Oil Free and perfect for any skin type, Clinique's Blended Loose Powder has been a top seller and award winner in the prestige makeup category for decades. Each jar (fits on your palm) comes with a swivel out brush (retracted it's about three inches long) that can be used for application and or touchups. Inside the jar is a plastic screen that helps you keep the majority of the powder in the jar even during application -- wonderful for those of us who tend to drop and spill.

Special Tips For Use:
To get the most flawless finish, Clinique recommends an application technique they call the ""powder rub down."" Tip a tiny amount of powder from the jar into one hand. Very gently rub your hands together to lightly distribute the powder across both palms. Then use your hands to `wash' your face with the powder. This technique helps keep the hairs on the brush from pushing the powder into the pores, accentuating their appearance. Any excess you see afterwards can be whisked off with the swivel-out brush that comes with each jar. 

If you like to touch up with powder throughout the day but don't want to carry the jar or a pressed powder compact, simply dip your brush into the powder in the top of the jar, swivel retract the bristles containing the powder, pop the cap on top, and you can now drop the brush into your purse for a loose powder touch up any time. 

Color Notes: 
-Transparency 1: Has almost no discernible color. For the palest of the pale. This powder is only a hairs breath darker than baby powder.
-Transparency 2: This powder has a noticeable light pink tone. Excellent for perking up a sallow (yellowish) complexion. Also great for Asian women who want that porcelain look.  As a redhead, I find this color powder gives my skin the perk it needs without leaving me looking orange as so many others do.
-Transparency Neutral: Like Transparency 2 without the pink for when 1 is too light and 3 is too dark.
-Transparency 3: Clinique's most popular color . . . by far.  If you've ever received a sample in a Gift before, this is it. A very safe color to choose.
-Transparency 4 Plus: A little darker than the old Transparency 4. For when you have a tan or if you're olive or Hispanic without much of a tan.
-Transparency 5: For when you're dark naturally. A big jump from Transparency 4 Plus. Dark Hispanics and the well tanned fit well here.
-Transparency 6: For dark complexions such as African American, though won't be dark enough for the darkest of dark.
-Transparency Bronze: For all skin colors. Although all the other colors are matte in finish (no shine, glisten, or sparkles) Transparency Bronze is the exception. This color is a deep bronzing powder that goes on the skin surprisingly light and with a hint of sheen for that sun-kissed look. Very pretty applied to the cheeks with just a tiny hint on the forehead, nose, and chin"

I used a Gillette Sensor. It was okay. I upgraded to Sensor XL. It was pretty good. I tried a Mach 3, and I hated it -- it felt like I was wiping my face with a wall of blades. I finally settled on Sensor 3 -- at nearly 2 bucks a blade. It got the job done, but there was no real joy in shaving. Considering I have to do it at least once a day (twice if I'm going out at night) the process should be more enjoyable.

After quite a bit of research, including newsgroups and customer reviews, I splurged and got the Merkur Futur (though I got the chrome finish). 

Shaving is awesome, and I literally look forward to it. Lathering up the shave cream (I use Crabtree and Evelyn Sandlewood) with this brush is a real treat. Super soft, holds a ton of water, and results in a thick lather. (Be warned, the first few times you use it, it stinks like wet badger... but it goes away).

The razor itself is heavy... I mean heavy. Which is good, because you need to let the razor do the work -- NO PRESSURE, OR YOU WILL TAKE OFF YOU FACE). The main difference between this razor and shaving with cartridges, is that you actually feel the blade against your face (as opposed to a chunk of plastic).  Anyone who has had a shave with a barber knows how great this feels.

Once I got the technique down it is as close and smooth a shave as I have ever had. Finishing up with a cold water splash, non-alcoholic toner / aftershave, and a moisturizing lotion, is an invigorating way to start the day.

Please note: as stated above the brush smells a little ""badgery"" at first, but it goes away. The head of the razor does not pivot, so you have to follow the contours of your face. And the head itself it bulky, so you have to work on your technique around your nose, and under you chin.

In sum, this razor adds an old-school, refreshing routine to my mornings. I love it, and would whole-heartedly recommend it."

Blaize,"Jacksonville, FL United States","During my seven year shaving career, I've run the gauntlet of shaving implementations.  After shaving with contemporary disposable cartridge razors and electric razors with `goo', I was left with much to be desired.  Ingrown hairs and razor burn were starting to be a little too familiar.   

Upon taking the set out of the box, I was met by quality and heft from each piece and went straight to the sink for a test drive.  I didn't receive my Art of Shaving lavender scented shave cream until the day after, so I made do with the Aveno shave gel I had on hand.  The first thing I experienced while working up a lather with the badger hair brush, was the distinct smell of wet badger.  After a thorough washing and rinsing, the badger smell had subsided enough to continue.  I had read a few guides from classicshaving.com on the proper technique, but really there was nothing to it.  I made sure my skin was taught and let the weight of the shaver do all the work.  I found that it didn't take much longer than a normal shave, even on my first go.  It took me two weeks of shaving to get my first knick.  At that point, I was getting a little complacent and placed the razor on my chin at an odd angle.  It was very minor and I haven't repeated the folly.  

The smell of wed badger totally subsided after about three days of use; replaced by the soothing smell of lavender.  I'm looking forward to trying out other shave creams.  While the Art of Shaving cream provides adequate lather coverage, I feel that it could be thicker.  I am, however, only comparing it to contemporary shave gels, whose thousands of dollars of R&D could produce incomparable lather results.  I foresee me and my Futur in a life long relationship.  

I asked my dad why he never told me about the satisfaction you can get from a good double edged wet shave.  He said, ""I don't know.  I guess it's just been so long since I've used one.  Right now, I'm using one with 4 blades that vibrates.""  Guess what he got for father's day. "

Rudock ""CleverCynic""",NC,"I was reluctant to get this one because it was one of the few I was already familiar with from the ole high school days, for many of the same reasons the other reviewer stated, it's been around for a long time and many already have good or bad associations with the scent and other guys who have worn it. I can understand why he gave it three stars, but I'm here to review it based on its scent and merits and not the pop-culture story that surrounds it. 
The fact is, Guy Laroche nailed an almost perfect scent right at the eve of the fragrance for men explosion. While its Polo Green counterpart tended to smell more to me like a pesticide in the bottle, this cologne is both decidedly masculine and decidedly beautiful at the same time. It has elegance and blatant animalism. It is musky and spicy without being floral or citrusy. The age and popularity and generation (zeroing in on age) associated with it will probably prevent me from overusing it, but it still ranks very high in scent tests from woman, possibly continuing to be the best fragrance out there. As for the synthetic scent the other reviewer mentioned, this is probably of the last made before the manipulation of benzene aromatics very common in most newer colognes that he probably likes a lot. Most likely its the lack of organic citrus notes that caused the statement. 
It's not hip or the newest thing, but damn does it smell GOOD! "

I had my hair up in a bun (I had put it up to workout) and when I let down my hair after it was dry it felt so much thicker and almost like I had more hair.

I was not quite sure why, but then I read about the strengthening effects of this shampoo and conditioner. My hair also felt so much cleaner and silky as if there was no build up and I had washed my hair in mountain spring water.

Ingredients in Shampoo: Water, Rice Bran, Rice Oil, Coconut Oil, Seaweed, Ginseng, Aloe, Wheat Powder, Swertia Herb.
Ingredients in Conditioner: Water, Rice Bran, Rice Oil, Coconut Oil, Seaweed, Ginseng, Aloe, Wheat Powder, Swertia Herb, Natural Vitamin E.

Since this product is relatively expensive, I may have to alternate it with other shampoos and conditioners, but it definitely works. The shampoo doesn't strip the hair the way other harsh shampoos do and I'm very impressed with the natural ingredients cleaning my hair so well. If you have fine or oily hair you may be especially impressed. You also only have to shampoo once, which saves time.

Results after one use:

Smoother Texture
Stronger Hair
Cleaner Hair
More Body - especially if you have fine hair

Looking forward to trying other products with rice bran. You can order a week's supply of this product to try. I think you will fall in love with the shampoo and conditioner.

The Shiseido compact is a powder that can be used wet or dry and it has a lot of sunscreening power. It has a physical block and blocks UVA and UVB.

It's not easy to find a match (mine is darker than I typically use in liquid) but it goes on fairly sheer if you want to apply it dry. The compact itself is a very pretty beachy dark aqua and has a compartment for a sponge to use wet or dry. The refill means you get plenty of use from the compact.

As I got older (Im 38 now) it seemed to get darker. I am a makeup artist by profession, so believe me when I say that I have tried all kinds of concealers. Some went on smooth but the coverage didnot last and by mid-day there were those dark circles again. I literally had to carry concealer with me because I had to reapply atleast 3 times a day. The heavier concealers worked when I put them on but after awhile it would cake under my eyes, dry out and make my lines more visible and really made me look older! I was hesitant about Hylexin, like everyone, because of the price. I started using it but didnt see any results after few days. I guess it didnt help that I was constantly looking in the mirror.I started to get disappointed but kept on using it. I swear by the 3rd-4th week I could actually see a difference! My circles were way lighter and less noticeable! I dont have ""bags"" or puffiness, just dark circles and I have olive skin. As I continue to use it, it seems to be getter better and better. It might not take it away completely, but it sure has faded enough that I can now use a concealer (or just a fuller coverage foundation!) and not have to worry about it fading or caking. I feel bad that some people may not have gotten the results that they hoped for, but what do you have to loose! Yeah $95 is alot, but its cheaper and not as invasive as surgery. And it has the same 50/50 chance as cosmetic procedures. Everyones skin is different and reacts differently like any other skincare/cosmetics product. Also, you need to follow the instructions exactly! I applied twice a day and didnot skip any application. I tried very hard to stay out of the sun and used my same skincare routine. I will post another review in a few weeks and see if the circles improved anymore.  I hope this review has helped"

They did not totally go away after using Hylexin, but they faded a great deal.  I am very fair so this might work better on people with fair skin, as several of the negative reviewers seem to have had darker skin.  BEST RESULTS were on the puffiness under my eyes, which had gotten much worse since I got a little older.  The skin under my eyes no longer sags at all, and superficial wrinkles are definitely minimized.  I feel like I look a lot better after using the product for several months.  I started out with a half-size product from a combo trial pack, and I liked it so much that I've bought the full size product now.  It last forever, so it's really not that expensive over time.  I think it's worth a try for people with similar problems to mine.  I guess everyone's different, but I've been quite happy with the product"

That's another reason why I tried this product.  It did burn, but not NEARLY as bad as other relaxers my stylist has used.  It was extremely manageable and not very uncomfortable.  I only left the product on my hair for the 25 minutes it recommends.    It took something like 12 shampoos for the stuff to neutralize.  My hair turned out curly instead of straight.  Guess I didn't ""smooth"" well enough.  I would def recommend to have a stylist put it in for you so you get the great results.  My hair looks really great flat ironed, but the true test will come after I've had the perm in for a few weeks.  My hair typically breaks off really bad right around the time that I need a retouch.  I am hoping that doesn't happen w/this product.  That will really let me know if it's worth the 60 bucks"

My mum was the one who found it and I'm eternally grateful to her as it worked out fantastic. Thanx Mum :) 

I am used to using various box relaxers from the store (Gentle Treatment, TCB, Dark and Lovely etc) and none of these come close. I have a combination of European/Carribean hair which is thick and coarse and so I need a really good relaxer to make it soft and straight.My hair has never been this straight from a box relaxer and it actually moves! :)

There is none of the usual ""burning"" sensation that often goes along with most relaxers. Nor is there a strong overwhelming smell that is enough to knock you out.

The quantity of the contents is great aswell. There are very few relaxers that you find with enough Conditioner provided to be used again later on.

It is well worth the price.My personal experience gave Salon results at a slightly cheaper price yet more expensive than those sold at Walgreens. I'll stick with the Phytorelaxer."

I relax and highlight my hair, so imagine the hell I was in when I heard that you should not chemically treat your hair when you are pregnant.  I tried to go along with that, however after 8 weeks I was in dire need of something.  I searched the web for a safe product and found this relaxer.  After rinsing it out and using the phyto shampoo and conditioner I was horrified with the fact that my hair felt like straw.  I rewashed it with Keracare shampoo and conditioner and it felt normal again.  The phyto relaxer did the same thing as a cheap drugstore relaxer, however it has a pleasant scent and doesn't burn your scalp.  After doing 2 or 3 relaxers myself I started to notice breakage.  But I assumed that it was from being pregnant.  I stopped doing my own relaxers when my belly started to weigh me down entirely too much.  I called Phyto and they gave me a listing of salons that use the relaxer on clients.  The salon I went to explained to me that I didn't understand placement when it comes to relaxer.  I was pretty much overlapping the product onto previously relaxed hair.  The instructions say not to do it, but it is really hard to control that.  I continued going to the salon for the relaxers and my hair grew back.  
Now a year later, I continue to use the salon and the product.  I am breastfeeding my son, so I stay away from the chemicals still.  I suggest this relaxer to all of my pregnant friends that don't want to walk around with crazy hair.  I mean pregnancy makes you feel bad enough"

I have normal skin with a little more oiliness in the T-Zone and I get blackheads and the occasional breakout. I have tried all kinds of different product lines (Urban Defense, DDF, Dior, Philosphy, Bliss, etc.) and am the happiest with the results I get from Murad. 
I can't review just one product because I think the combination is what gives me such great results. I have been using Murad for about 2 1/2 years now so I have tried a lot of the Murad products and found a routine that works great for me. 

In the morning I use the AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser (love it! the gritiness gives you very smooth surface for applying makeup) then the Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel and the Skin Perfecting Lotion which I mix and apply together so that I don't use as much. Last I put on my Moisture Silk Eye Gel and I'm ready to go.  

At night I use the Clarifying Cleanser followed by the Clarifying Toner, the Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel, the Perfecting Lotion and the best product of all the Night Reform Treatment (see my review of that product for details, I love it!) and again I use the Moisture Silk Eye Gel. 

Once a week I throw in the Exfoliating Fruit Enzyme Mask and I have perfect skin if I stick to the program everyday. My skin looks and feels better than it ever has and people always guess my age to be around 23 so it must be doing something right!

Murad Products that I don't like:

2. Purifying Face Scrub 
3. The products for combination skin - they are ok but the acne line is so mild that people with combination skin will see better results using it. (I have used both product lines)"

I am an esthetician that has lots of trouble with hormonal breakouts on my chin, jawline and neck. I had been using a system with benzoyl peroxide that was just too drying, even though I do have an oily skin type. This kit is great. All of the products are full size (except the samples of the peels). The products are very concentrated, so I expect that this kit will last around 3 months. I noticed an immediate difference in my skin - brighter, firmer, healthier glow. I've now been using it for two weeks. I've had a few hormonal breakouts (right before my period) but they are very small and clear up much faster. It is really getting rid of  red scarring left over from previous breakouts and my fine lines around my eyes are certainly decreasing too. The sample peels in the kit are awesome. You can get 2 peels out of each sample set - so about a total of 6 treatments. I reccomend using the peels 2X week to get you started - it really kicks up the results"

I have been washing my hair with the Shine and protect shampoo and conditioner twice a week (I washed my hair everyday, but I can't wash it everyday with Ojon because it would be too heavy). My hair looks longer since I have been using this product and it seems healthier and shinier. it smells sort like gum or push-ups. I will definitely be buying full sizes of these when I run out. The leave in glossing cream I used every time I wash my hair. The tube size is 2 oz (the same as the shampoo and conditioner) but, it takes so little for my hair that I think it will last six to eight months and it really does work. This is probably the best glossing cream ever (certainly for oily hair)- it's better than Kiehls and Frederic Fekkai and they are both really good. I also use the  shine and protect glossing mist when I ""do"" my hair (straightening iron or rollers). It works well and makes my hair glossy not greasy and stringy.

It gets really frizzy in humid weather and I used to use John Frieda serum, and that worked well for me. The bottle was just really small and I would run out fast because of my long hair. I decided to buy this product. It has a thinner consistency than John Frieda's serum but it works just as well. It does make my hair soft and it tames the flyaways, but I would not use this product alone in my hair. I usually put a little of this on before I blowdry, a little afterwards and then I put Bed Head's after party in my hair before I straight iron my hair. Both the bed head and Biosilk really sink into my hair and gets absorbed and never looks greasy. After I do that, my hair is super soft. 
I like that the bottle is a good size considering you only need like a dime sized amount but I think it is a little pricey. But considering how long it will last, I think it is worth it. I would never use this on my skin (It says you can use this on your skin) just because I would feel like I am putting oil or something on my skin. And it also smells a little like hair spray, but it is not overpowering. Once you put it in your hair, you cannot smell it. All in all, a great product."

I have used it for a few years now, and my hair is in the best condition it has probley ever been in. I have very thick, curly hair that I regularly straighten with a CHI hot iron and color treat, so my hair is rather prone to damage. Before I used this product, my hair was FRIED! It was dry, crispy, and always smelled burnt from straighting it. It was pretty bad. When I went to get my hair cut, the hair dresser made a comment on how badly damaged my hair was. I told her it was from straighting and coloring my hair, and she told my about Biosilk. I little bottle came with the CHI I bought, but I had never bothered to use it. She told me to apply a little bit of it before the next time I straighten my hair to see if it helped. After my first use, my hair was noticably softer, shinier, and less frizzy. So, i continued to use it. It worked even better after I used it for while. It improved the overall condition of my hair, and has made it so much more managable. Another great thing about Biosilk is the subsatnce of it. It has thick, watery like, smooth feel to it. I use about a quarter-sized amount after a shower on wet hair, and right before I style on dry hair. It is so light weight, I can't even tell I have anything in my hair. Because I don't have to use very much, a bottle lasts me for several months. Sure its a little expensive, but it is defenitly worth it! I recommend it to anybody with troublsome hair, or anybody who just wants great-looking hair. I promise, you will love it!!!!!!"

The name is appropriate because it really does define and that gives the eyes a beautiful open appearance. Lancome is known for making the best mascara and the reputation is well deserved. And if you really want dramatically flutterable lashes try putting on Lancomes base                                    coat which makes lashes fuller too and lengthens.

Johnson,,"I have been getting irritated skin / razor bumps / ingrown hairs (the whole nine yards) ever since I started shaving.  I've tried different cartridges, different methods of shaving, and even a cutthroat razor (had to give that up right away -- much too much maintenance).  However, with the purchase of this Merkur HD safety razor, I've finally found a product that I can stick with.  People say it takes some getting used to, but I found it not the slightest bit more difficult than shaving with a cartridge razor.  I get the closest shaves ever with it, with practically no irritation.  Other pluses include blades that last nearly a week and only cost 50 cents a piece!!  With cartridges costing up to three dollars, it's time to go old school (especially since I'm a poor college student).

I can't compare this model to other safety razors, but I can say that it is a great intro safety razor.  Good weight, and simple to use.  I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone fed up with the cost of cartridges, and looking for a simple, effective solution"

I'm 24.  My first razor was the same kind of DE razor that my dad used (some Gillette).  Around 17 the mach 3 came out and since the full knowledge of shaving was never really handed down to me, I opted for the mach 3 which was easy to use and gave a decent shave.  I've essentially stuck with the Mach 3 until now, but being generally unsatisfied with the closeness of my shave I decided to investigate and turned back to the safety razor picking up this Merkur HD.  I just used it for the first time and it turned out to be significantly more satisfying than I had hoped it would be.  I nicked myself a few times without really noticing so there's some learning curve but as of now I've only used it once and I can tell you that it won't take long to get it down. 

A couple thoughts:
1) I'm really glad that I went for an HD.  I thought the HD may be heavy (and it may be compared to other DE razors) but I wouldn't want it to be any lighter.  It already feels light in my hand.

2) The biggest thing to keep in mind about the shave is that the razor cuts by keeping it perpendicular to your skin.  The most notable difference between shaving with the Mach 3 v. the Merkur HD centered around this.  With the Mach 3 I kind of feel like I have to drag the blade across my skin (kind of scraping it) to get a close shave (which can be done and I don't notice that much irritation).  That said most of the shave with the HD was as close, but since the aim is to keep the blade perpendicular, the razor felt more like it was gliding over the skin. Very nice.

3) To put in a new blade you unscrew the bottom and the top part comes off.  You pop in the blade, put the top back on and screw the bottom to tighten the top.  

It should be noted that I've started shaving at night so that I can tell what I'm doing (I'm not a morning person) so in the morning if I'm not really going to pay attention the Mach 3 may still be better.  Also, I'm using cheap soap and a boar brush from CVS until the stuff I ordered comes in so with any luck it will be even nicer next time"

This stuff does help keep your pores clean also.  I would recommend using this product every couple of weeks and DEFINATELY before a big event (pictures etc).  Basically you put a gel over your face and then add a hydrogen peroxide cream, the whole thing foams up, you wait 1-3 minutes (intense tingling experienced at times) and then rinse.

One thing, a day after the peel my skin looks a little red/blotchy in places but the day after that it's stunning so if you are indeed purchasing this for a wedding, etc. use it 2 days before the big day or else you might look like a splotchy bride.

Most of Philosophy's products are fabulous and if you're going to go for this, it works well with the Real Purity facial cleanser to use right after the peel, and then the Hope in a Jar moisturizer after that. "

The fragrance is a prismatic rainbow of juicy fruits and florals, heavily laden with succulent honeysuckle and musky base. I love the lasting power of the fragrant aura that envelops me the second I pray it on and the bottle looks absolutely breathtaking on my dresser. The scent itself is heady and aromatic, more floral and sophisticated than most tropical fragrance; I don't smell bananas and coconut here but soft orchid, pulpy woods, juicy plum and soft dewy honeysuckle with its sparkling golden nectar.

This is one of my favorite perfumes now, something I reach for very often and something that puts a smile on my face whenever I get a whiff of it. One a rainy and gray monday morning I feel that I can carry a layer of ambrosial paradise that sets on me like a soft cloud of euphoric proportions as it nestles itself into my skin and exudes a shimmery cloud of scent all day long. It's really a rainbow of happiness in a bottle. 

The top notes are Eden's Mist, Blue Hyacinth, Orange Flower Templar, Jabuticaba Fruit.
Middle notes are Laelia Orchid, Crepe Jasmin, Mahonia Japonica, Pink Honeysuckle balanced over a base of Natal Plum Blossoms, Ambrette Seed, Zebrano Wood, Golden Melaleuca Bark for a sweet and fruity concoction.

With all my newfound knowledge about cologne history, perspective, and opinions, I used these colognes to give an informative speech this evening in my public speaking course, complete with all the bottles present. I sprayed CURVE onto myself when it arrived, and now I am comparing all of the new scents to my favorites so far, HUGO and CANDIES. My impression was that it was more serious than Hugo, had a sweetish overtone combined with musk, and then there was sort of a greenish bitter forest type scent to it that I wasn't crazy about. I think I may have been dissappointed at first, but that soon changed. After about fifteen minutes the smell got to be really good and the elements I hadn't liked were gone or had matured into subtle forms that went well together. 
After the speech I allowed the class to sample all of the colognes, and Curve was commented on the most, followed by Drakkar, then Hugo. All of the women liked it and seemed to have great associations with it, and for that I have to ensure that it gets the full 5 stars. I continue to wear it now later this same evening and it has quite grown on me. 
If you only bought Curve as your main cologne, you'd be quite alright. Subtle enough for casual wear and bright enough for clubbing. Overall good mix"

Grisdale,"Chicago, IL  USA","I am allergic to benzoyl peroxide.  So, there are many products that I can't use for acne.  I tried everything that didn't have benzoyl peroxide in it - even expensive department store brands and beauty brands to clear up my skin.  Murad's Acne System was the only one that worked!  My skin cleared up in a week.  I didn't go through any purging that I could tell.  However, I started using the system right after a professional deep cleansing facial.  It took several months to get completely clear but it worked.  I have been using it for several years now and break out if I forget it when I'm travelling.  I can't live without it!  I recently got a facial on a cruise and the woman couldn't believe that I had problems with breakouts.  I would if I wasn't using my Murad.

I faithfully wash my face in the shower with the cleansing gel every morning.  Once or twice a week I use the AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser that I purchased separately.  I then apply the Acne Treatment Gel after I've dried off.  I follow with the moisturizer in the kit.  I do the same thing at night (except I'm not in the shower).  I almost never need the spot treatment now.  I have several tubes drying up in my cabinet.  I bought the mask separately too and used it a lot in the beginning but now I think the tube has dried up.  I haven't needed it in over a year.  I also used the vitamin supplements in the beginning.  However, since I do take vitamins anyway, I didn't really notice that they made a difference.  I also get a facial by a professional once and awhile to give my skin a boost.  However, since they are $$$ I tend to only get 2 or 3 a year.  Last year I only had one and my skin looked great. "

Mistral, as I was happy to discover, is also the name of a line of bath and body products, all French inspired, all lusciously lovely from scented soaps to soothing lotions to rejuvenating body butters. 

Matthew Tilker, founder and president of Mistral, utilizes Shea butter, which is an efficacious natural healer, in a myriad of must-have forms. Derived from the nuts of the African Shea Tree (according to sacred custom the nuts are harvested primarily by women), this butter is highly emollient, a boon for those with dry skin, chapped lips, any number of skin irritations. 

The pure Shea Butter soap comes in a plethora of inviting fragrances, all milled six times (while others boast being triple milled). South Seas is a particular favorite - it's as fresh as an ocean breeze and as calming, soothing as a tropical island. The marine scent is accented with a touch of grapefruit, white flowers and soft woods. An irresistible combination. 

South Seas is a fragrance with which you wish to surround yourself - made possible by the shower gel, body lotion, massage bath and body oil, bath salts and candle all available at very accessible prices.

I live in Hawaii, and the salt water and sun can take a beating to your skin, so I love this product!  It does an awesome job of exfoliating away dead and dry skin, and the essential oils in the bar give my skin it's moisture back.  Though like mentioned in other reviews, the almond pieces may be too rough for sensitive skin, and I wouldn't recommend this for daily use for anyone who has oily skin.  Once a week should be great.

The only thing I didn't care was the fact that Buffy did leave a slight coat of oil on my skin, and unless I was taking a really hot shower, my shower/tub floor was left feeling slick also.  I usually have to rinse again quickly with my soap, but this bar is a really nice skin conditioner for once-a-week treatments. I like to save the bar and use it when I have some time to relax for a while in the tub.  That way I'll do the bar right when I get in, and just let the essential oils absorb into my skin. I love it!

Still highly recommended"

This has been my daily moisturizer for several years. It makes my skin very soft, very healthy looking, and glowing. It makes me look radiant. I have given it as a gift to my sister and to other women, and they have all liked it as much as I have. No one has had any adverse reactions. You can notice a difference after just one use. When I've run out and used something else temporarily, I always can see the difference again once I start back up. It is as close as it gets to a miracle cream.

I do not wear makeup, so Hope In A Jar is it.  I am 49 years old and I think my skin looks incredible.  The friends I have given it to also like to keep a natural look and prefer their skin without heavy creams, thick moisturizers and sunscreens, or makeup. 

The women I know who are fans of Hope In A Jar are like me. We're kind of lazy no-fuss ""one cream that does it all"" people; instead of one jar of something for one thing, and another for something else---eye creams, night time moisturizers, daytime moisturizers, etc.---we're the type that wants just one that can do the job and then be done with it. In other words, we don't have the patience to fuss with our looks a lot, or to spend money buying bunches of different creams to keep track of and remember to use.

Unlike other reviewers, I love the smell, which is not perfumey, but definitely pleasantly distinctive. I use it around my eyes also, and have not had an allergic reaction.  It seems, though, that these are the two biggest problems with Hope---the distinctive odor and allergic reactions among some people.  I would suggest buying it the first time from somewhere you could return it if you don't care for it; although in my opinion, this would be unlikely, apparently it is possible. Philosophy now makes another version of Hope In A Jar for sensitive skin; if you know that your skin in tempermental, perhaps it would be better to also try this version. I have stuck with Hope In A Jar because it works so well for me. 

It seems expensive, but it is not because it lasts a long, long time.  The two-ounce jar lasts me about six months.  I use a toner and then Hope In A Jar and that's it.  I'm done with my face in 30 seconds. Plus, it gives me a look that most women use makeup to get, so I think it's a bargain.

After spending a small fortune on skincare products, I have finally found a product I can count on.  Hope in a Jar leaves my skin with a clean yet moisturized feeling, and is a perfect base for foundation, as it is not greasy or oily.  And, as an added bonus, the price seems reasonable for something that lasts so long.  It is necessary to use a good eye cream as well, as this product is not meant for the eye area, and can be slightly irritating.  Overall, I have seen a marked improvement in my skin in the last 3 months since using this product"

I expect glosses to be flavorful and these aren't. But with all the grandeur of the product, I can't give it less than 5 stars. A note to buyers: the colors on here aren't the actual colors.

Pink Sugar makes me feel fabulous when I wear it; it's so light and `warm' with a base of sensual vanilla. I have the large bottle, body mousse & deodorent at home, and the smaller bottle in my handbag. I don't get bored with this fragrence, like I do with everything else I've tried over the years.

The first time I wore Pink Sugar to work one colleague commented on the aroma of drinking chocolate as I was in the lift with her. The next time I was in the lift, everyone commented on my lovely vanilla perfume. After I applied a freshen up spray, another colleague said she could smell cakes! Yet another colleague demanded to know what I was wearing, and where she could get some. Strangers come up to me in the street to ask what scent I'm wearing...

No this isn't a cheesy ad, it really happened!! 


What do I sense first? Liquorice, a rich aniseed scent that gradually settles into a middle note of caramel. Marshmallow is the first word that springs to mind to me. 

If you like Angel, Fantasy or Princess you need to give this a try!

Hawkins ""Laura Wilde""",USA,"Think of it as loose eye shadow and eyeliner . . . with a kick. Laura Mercier Mineral Eye Powders are so incredibly versatile and can be applied wet or dry, as shadow or as liner, that it's possible to create endless different looks that range from casual and pretty to stunning and dramatic. Choosing to apply wet or dry will not only change to application but will give you beautifully different textures and definitions and degrees of sparkle.  

Using the mineral eye powder wet will make the color and look more intense and defined but will give it less sparkle. You'll also get an increase in the wear and the added option of using the powder as a liner. Using the powders dry will give them the most sparkle punch.

Laura Mercier Mineral Eye Powders come in six different shades -- two light colors: Milky Way & Galaxy and two intense colors: Meteor, Eclipse, Constellation, & Asteroid.

All Laura Mercier eye products are ophthalmologist and dermatologist tested.


Color Notes:

Milky Way - a very light, barely pink, opalescent color that will not only add silver toned sparkle but will lighten the feature or eye shadow color on which it is applied. Choose this color if you want to highlight and lighten.
 
Galaxy - a very light, barely grey-taupe color that will add gold tone sparkle but will otherwise blend into all but the darkest skin colors. Choose this color if you want the starstruck look but don't otherwise want to change your eye shadow color. This color will also work well on other areas of the face. Try putting just a dab in the inside corner of each eye for a real, yet subtle, eye pop.

Meteor - an intense color of green in the forest family with silver toned sparkle. Makes the most amazing eye liner color. 

Eclipse - an intense color of black with silver sheen. Makes a classic looking eyeliner color but with the updated twist of star struck sparkle.

Constellation - an intense color of purple that's similar to Laura's famous Black Violet Kohl Pencil. The sparkle on this one is gold tone. Women with green or hazel eyes will love how Constellation makes their eye color really pop. 

Asteroid - An intense color of dark blue with silver sheen. Makes a beautiful eye liner for brown and blue eyes and will help remove redness from the eyes of any shade. 


Basic ""how to use"" tips:
    * To line the eyes: dampen Wet/Dry Definer Brush with water, dip into one of the four darker shades, and mix to desired consistency. I like to use the back of my hand as a `palette' to mix the powder. To increase the shimmer, apply more powder on top of the eyeliner but this time use the brush dry. To further lengthen the wear of the powder as a liner, first line the eyes with one of Laura's Kohl Eye Pencils and then apply the powder on top.  This will also give your liner extra sheen.
    * To use as eye color: dampen Wet/Dry Definer Brush with water, dip into a darker shade and mix to desired consistency, once again using the back of the hand. Apply to eyelid and blend color with Ponytail Brush or apply directly to the eyelid with the dry brush- using wet leaves a sheen finish, using dry leaves a sparkly finish.

Fun ""how to use"" tips:
-Try Meteor as a shadow, lined with the Eclipse, and smudge Constellation all around for that smokey smudgy look.
-Cover your entire eyelid with Milky Way and line with Asteroid.
-Put dots of Galaxy in the inside corners of your eyes and just apply mascara"

Herbalism is meant for oily skin; however I find it perfect for my combination skin.  It never leaves my skin dry or patchy, and throughout the day my skin has a nice matte look, thanks to the rice bran in the cleanser.  

I tried this as a sample and although it worked really well, I didn't care for the strong herbal scent of Herbalism and I didn't like the rose petals in the cleanser because they `got in the way' or just fell in the sink as I cleansed.  I prefer a cleanser with a more uniform consistency (like LUSH's Angels on Bare Skin; see my review), so I only buy Herbalism in small quantities (less than $5 amounts) and use it when my face is really feeling oily.  Other wise I use LUSH's Ocean Salt or Angels on Bare Skin as my nightly cleanser.

I would have normally declined her offer of a mini-make-over, but I was feeling rather adventurous and wanted to update some of my make-up items, so I followed her to her chair where she went to work on me.  

I have to say, in the past, I have been nonplussed and unimpressed with makeovers like these.  But when the rep handed me the mirror, I gasped.  Even under the harsh lighting, my complexion looked pretty darn flawless for a youthful grandmother trying to hold on to any vestige of good looks.  

I bought the foundation, along with the finishing powder and a few other Dior goodies.  I figured I would probably use it a few times and realize it didn't really look as good on me at home or in the office as it did when the Dior rep did my makeup in the store.  Then I would experience buyer's remorse and continue my quest for the perfect foundation. 

Lucky for me, I was wrong.  This product has become one of my top choices for foundation.  It doesn't settle in the fine lines around my eyes, or in my pores.  Instead, it does what it says -- smooths out my complexion. The color chosen for me looks natural with no lines of demarcation. And the coverage is what I prefer at this stage in my life.  

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I am still searching for this type of lush coverage that gives my combo skin less shine by mid-day.  But for now, I will finish using the bottle, and probably purchase another, which is something I haven't done with other foundations in some time.  

My biggest tip with this foundation is a little goes a long way.  The Dior rep used a make-up brush and that tends to give more of a sheer, even coverage.  At $50, it wouldn't seem to be a bargain, but if you use it as I've described, it should last you several months. "

I said ""Not me!"" before realizing that I WAS wearing some karma kream. I said so, and she asked where I'd gotten it. Phew! I was thinking someone had allergies or something and I was one of those people who was wearing too much perfume/lotion/whatever, oblivious to the fact that everyone around them was holding their nose. But she was actually really curious, and followed me past security so she could get the name of the store (Lush!) that sells this great stuff. 

Seriously, it's great! I've never in my life had anyone remark on any perfume or scented lotion I was wearing until I found karma kream, which I received as a sample in a recent order of Lush goodies. Now strangers, relatives, and friends are all asking me where they can get some of this stuff. 

The karma scent is really, really great - citrusy, with a tiny hint of lavendar, pine, and patchouli. You won't smell like a dirty hippie, though, trust me. The patchouli and pine are just bass notes to the main players - orange flower water, citrus, and lavendar scents. So fresh! It's great. Really wakes me up in the morning, and refreshes me during the day if I put some on.

This lotion won't leave your skin feeling greasy, either, like so many moisturizers can. My skin is really thanking me for discovering Lush products. If you want a subtle perfume but don't want something as strong as a concentrated perfume, this lotion is great, and as an added benefit, it will moisturize your skin while you're wearing it! And if you want a light perfume, you can put some karma kream on your neck, arms, or legs to have just a hint of scent."

If you'd like the effect to be beautiful, soft, touchable, kissable, skin, just smooth on Karma Kream.

	One other effect caused by Karma Kream is a delightful lingering fragrance.

	It's said that more people in the world believe in karma than do not.  Hmmmmm, don't know about that.  But, I do know that all of us want good karma and that's  Karma Kream.

	There now, apply Karma Kream before bedtime and rest well secure in the knowledge that your skin will be softer in the morning, and some day your Prince will come.

KEEP IT SIMPLE-An Active 37 Year Old Male Says ADIOS ACNE and HELLO FRESH & NEW SKIN!,"October 21, 2005","Peter V. Cannice ""Peter Vincent Cannice of Scottsdale Arizona""","Scottsdale, Arizona USA","Although most every fitness magazine I read has at least 2 articles about ""Health and Beauty/Grooming"", I'm still pretty certain that we're, Most Men in General, still in the woods in regard to proper skin care. The times are changing, more rapidly than ever before, and the need for separating the good, the bad and the ugly is HERE!

I'm a fairly active 37 year old male with fairly nice skin, although my Italian heritage prediposes my olive skin to being much oilier than I'd like. I have small areas of ""Combination Skin"", in addition to my generally oily skin type, which has often been more difficult to manage than anything else. Gone are the days of Vaseline and generic cleansers and moisturizers. Welcome are the days of skin products designed for treat and maintain almost any possible skin type. 

My review is submitted, as I, too, had no idea that ""Philosophy"" was anything other than one of the hardest classes I ever surived through in College! When I told my close friend, an aspiring and very beautiful female model and actress, that she REALLY had a youthful glow and joked about her having ""Some cosmetic work done!"", she accepted it quite well and with a big southern smile. She told me that it wasn't plastic surgery and it wasn't any high-tech laser procedure or over-priced exfolliant scrub. Instead, she said she was on the run and would stop by to visit with myself and my spouse after dinner.

Karin came over with a bag full of goodies, everything from home-baked chocolate chip and almond cookies to a gift certificate for a nice eatery in town (since I had mowed her lawe and few times)! But that wasn't the end of the gifts. She proceeded to give us 2 Philosophy Skin Care Products. My spouse had heard of them in a recent review in a popular magazine, but it was all brand new to me. Karin said that it was a gift for both of us and she wanted us both to use the exfoliator AND the moisturizer too. My spouse was thrilled to death with the new ""products"" and I was more thrilled (at that time) with the warm chocolate chip cookies.

Before bed we started to use the 2 products. Applying quality products was not new to me and over the years I've spent a few thousand in quality products to reduce my oily skin that often lead to acne-even after I turned 30. I didn't expect anything other than the ordinary smoothe and clean feeling after exfoliating, combined with the relaxed and cooling feel of the moisturizer. BOY-What a surprise I was in for!!

This is not a joke and I am not here with any special interest-other than to give a totally honest review of these products. My skin, in just 3 weeks, went from oily (with some combination areas) to normal and from shiny to glowing. Most impressive of all, was that (without any sort of drying effect on my skin) my facial acne is 90% gone. And I'll be truthful in telling you, in this review, that when my face is clear and looks good, I FEEL GOOD TOO!

I didn't have severe acne, but it was enough to consistently bother me and surprise me when I least needed an ""outbreak!""
I'm sold on these products and am online to purchase products for my Mom and her 2 Sisters in New York. I used to work as a professional actor and model, mostly doing television commercials and some print work. So I've tried just about everything and I've had some luck with other products-but NOTHING like the overall masculine and finsihed look that Philosophy Products brought to me. I'm 100% sold and I hope that this review was helpful to you. It's from mmy heart and it's the truth. I hope and pray that you have similar or even better results that I have experienced. Good Luck To You! You won't be unhappy with these products, all of which are under a great satisfaction guarantee (another reason I tried them)!

Let me know how it works out!

At any rate, I believe that the scent is accurate.  In addition, the preshave oil followed by their sandlewood shaving cream gives one as close a shave as I have ever experienced.  Used to suffer from 5:00 ""shadow"", being in sales this is unsightly; after using the C.M. product that is a thing of the past.

This excellent product is expensive.  However, a hot, wet lather shave for this reviewer makes this mundane chore pleasurable.  The badger hair shaving brush is a nice addition or it makes a great gift.

The results are much more precise, longer lasting and smoother. But I was still getting those big ugly ingrown hairs. So the wax technician gave me a couple sample bottles of TendSkin. There was a noticable difference after 24 hours but I still had quite a few bumps remaining. I don't know if it was because I'm so suspectible to ingrown hairs or because I had so many to start with but it took a couple of months for my bikini area to completely clear up with twice daily application of TendSkin. I also exfoliate my bikini area several times a week - exfoliation will go a long way in preventing ingrown hairs. With the exfoliation and the daily application of TendSkin, the ingrown hairs are completely gone. I now use TendSkin only once a day and that is sufficient. My bikini area has never looked better. My only gripe with TendSkin is the cost - I put off buying a bottle for the longest because it's so expensive. I have one of the small 4 ounce bottles that I found at the less expensive price of $13 but that's still a bit much for this product. I'll continue to buy it because it works but it'd be nice if it were a little cheaper.

And for those who are wondering about the rubbing alcohol smell, I found that on me it disappeared as soon as the TendSkin dried. So don't let the smell of it deter you - if you are prone to ingrown hairs, TendSkin is the product for you. And to help it along, it's also a good idea to exfoliate the area regularly. :"

When I'm shopping it seems that most lines cater to lighter and medium skin tones, but Bobbi Brown really does come through with flattering options for all skin tones. The only draw back is that this foundation does not provide adequate SPF protection, even though it says SPF 15. Therefore, you will still need to wear a sunscreen underneath of at least SPF 15.

They don't have silicones and other products to weigh your hair down, so you will see some changes in your hair as it is getting healthier"

The shampoo is weird to use the first time, I lathered it in my hands like soap and then worked it through my fine long hair. Not too oily for me and I really like the smell. It took care of the dry fly away feel the cheap stuff in my hotel had left.

I brought several different sized chunks back to friends who all thought it was fun."

Rice Bran is the secret to these products and the results are immediately apparent in the texture of your skin. After just one to two uses, you start to notice a sense of calm and order descending upon your formerly sensitive skin. 

If you have oily or combination skin, you may be amazed at how balanced your skin is and how you no longer experience the shine breakthrough in your makeup due to the initially drying aspects of other cleansers. 

1. The Komenuka Bijin Facial Cleansing Foam is very economical and an eighth of a teaspoon is enough for a wonderful face cleansing experience. The ingredients include: Rice Germ Oil, Rice Bran, Coconut Oil, Seaweed, Aloe Algae, Ginkgo Biloba, Matricaria, Yeast, Perilla Ocymoides, Honey, Lithospermum and Fountain Water. 

2. Follow the cleanser with the Komenuka Bijin Skin Lotion and you may wonder why you are suddenly catching the scent of SAKE. In fact, this cleansing toner does contain SAKE along with Rice Bran, Seaweed, Aloe, Yeast, Glycyrrhizate, Orange, Lemon, Matricaria, Algae, Luffa Cylindrica and Fountain Water. The toner completes the process of removing impurities and also has the added benefit of contracting the pores so they look smaller. Men may also enjoy this as an aftershave lotion. If the toner is not included, they normally include the NS-K Special Toner with even more healing ingredients. 

3. The Moisture Cream goes a long way. The main oils are Rice Germ Oil, Jojoba Oil and Olive Oil. Vitamin E, Rice Bran and Aloe make this a skin-healing treat. 

4. Eye Moisture Jell - Also contains apple acid, lemon, seaweed and loquat leaf. Smooths the delicate eye area. 

5. Makeup Remover - A fragrance-free cream that removes makeup and mascara. Based on olive oil. 

6. Two Cleansing Powder Packets - Deep cleansing grains turn silky and creamy when you add water. 

7. The UV Cream is slightly tinted and waterproof. This sunblock also seems to even out skin tone. Could be used as a makeup base if you are looking for a more natural look. The cream is easy to apply and absorbs easily into the skin. You can apply this on its own or after the moisture cream and skin essence. 

8. Skin Care Cream - A body cream that is very healing with jojoba oil. 

9 & 10. Hair Shampoo & Conditioner - Thickens fine hair instantly. Removes buildup and leaves your hair feeling luxurious. 

If you are looking for an easy way to try out the skincare system or you just want to take these products with you wherever you go (they are addictive), then I can highly recommend this and any of the Komenuka products. I love how calm they make me feel. These products cover all bases and whether you live in a cold, dry or humid climate, your skin will feel protected. 

Other products to fall in love with: 

The Skin Essence contains Mulberry that naturally lightens discoloration from sun damage and aging. The antioxidants help to revitalize the skin. This is applied before the cream. 

Moisture Cream Silver - Super hydration with aloe, vitamin E and Rice Bran.

I'm not so sure about Oxygen, though. I have never really seen silver lip gloss, so I don't know how it would look on me. Hello, people, why not make a shade of red?
