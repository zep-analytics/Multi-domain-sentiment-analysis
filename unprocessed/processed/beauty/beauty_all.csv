I thought I could use this every other day and get by. 

However, it doesn't make your hair look freshly washed; it is just ok.  It takes ""bed head"" hair and makes it look acceptable for a little while.  After a couple of hours though, my hair looks oily and stringy again.

I use it before I take the kids to school and it gets me thru the morning.  Then I end up washing my hair later"

The conditioner feels like vegetable shortening or softened butter. Need to use more than average. The conditioner is average in detangling and after using it four times it does condition your hair, but no better than other quality brands. I do like that it seems to cut down on the drying time, but Bed Head has a similar product that's been out for a while. For that option I would rather choose Bed Head for quality and price"

For example, even in the hot, very humid atmosphere of Houston, TX it left my hair feeling dry and unhealthy, even after using his conditioner (alot of it). My hair looks awful after using it. And the bottle claims that it doesn't use toxic ingredients like MEA but it DOES use three different types of PEG, a petroleum based thicker found in most bath products that can erode wooden tables in just minutes. This is just as harmful as MEA, especially for people with sensitive scalps and hair. And it claims not to strip your hair but the products that are supposed to cleanse are much less apparent in the product than the PEG products. Since PEG is a thickener, you're also getting a diluted, toxic, solution. Even though Head and shoulders uses MEA I find that that even that works better than this. My hair doesn't feel like it has any more of its essential oils and I've switched back to the other hair products Iv'e been using. It's not worth your 20 dollars, its barely worth 5 dollars. My hair stylist also recommended Dove products if you need hydration. DON'T BUY IT!"

In the long run it is damaging for the hair and after some hours it really does not have that nice clean bounce that hair is supposed to have.
Jonathan is not the only good product out there. I have been using Phyto Shampoo from France and Kiehl's, both don't have the silicon smoothers either and yes, the hair does feel like straw right after you wash it. Get a big tooth comb and some guts and go through life with really clean hair!!!!

For example, even in the hot, very humid atmosphere of Houston, TX it left my hair feeling dry and unhealthy, even after using his conditioner (alot of it). My hair looks awful after using it. And the bottle claims that it doesn't use toxic ingredients like MEA but it DOES use three different types of PEG, a petroleum based thicker found in most bath products that can erode wooden tables in just minutes. This is just as harmful as MEA, especially for people with sensitive scalps and hair. And it claims not to strip your hair but the products that are supposed to cleanse are much less apparent in the product than the PEG products. Since PEG is a thickener, you're also getting a diluted, toxic, solution. Even though Head and shoulders uses MEA I find that that even that works better than this. My hair doesn't feel like it has any more of its essential oils and I've switched back to the other hair products Iv'e been using. It's not worth your 20 dollars, its barely worth 5 dollars.

Honestly, I wanted a good flat iron and I thought this was a good product because it was expensive...BIG MISTAKE.  My friend bought a straight iron for about $100 and she's had it for almost a year.  She also straightens her hair a lot more often than I do.  I don't know why I didn't ask her where she got hers.  Please read all the reviews before you make this purchase.  If you don't believe me, wait to see if someone you know buys it so you can find out first hand how bad this product is. "

Andis is a good brand of clipper, ""however"" $80 for this pair of clippers is $70 too much. The power is weak and it takes about 24 hours to fully charge. 

These clippers are not designed for professional use at all. I am not a barber, my wife cuts my hair every 2 weeks or so. It does a decent fade job and my 2 boys(3 and 4) are mixed and seems to cut through their hair with a little more ease than mine. 

However it seems that my past corded clippers had more power which translate to easier cutting and trimming. My wife has to constantly go over various spots multiple times because it did not hit the spot the first or 2nd time.

My recommendation is to do your research and go with another pair of Andis clippers, stay away from this pair, or you'll be finding yourself writing a review saying I agree with the first guy that reviewed this product"

I used Stay Beige (which I lightly patted on my face on top of Clinique's superfit liquid makeup - I have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. I also hated how Clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades, so that I had to settle for Honey in the liquid and Beige in the powder. As much as I went back to Macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades, they just wouldn't listen. Either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade, or they were convinced I was making a big deal out of nothing. Instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which I shouldn't have to do in the first place) I just switched to a different makeup line: Laura Mercier, which I am VERY happy with.

I've had many other friends who were unhappy with Clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand, as well. I'm not trying to knock the product. I'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people I know. I would definitely NOT recommend Clinique to anyone.

First of all, I gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. However, this product is sticky. VERY sticky! It does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. Not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. When I wear a lip gloss, I want to be soft and smooth feeling. I want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak. 

Also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. This will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. Very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!

Clinique Facial Soap with dish
Clinique Clarifying Lotion 2
Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion


About the same time I started using the Clinique 3-step system, I began wearing foundation for the first time. I found that my skin started breaking out and began to be dry in some spots. I stopped using the foundation after about 3 months because I thought that was the issue. However, my skin problems did not improve and I even moved down a level in the Clinique system to one for more sensitive skin.

However, after about 7 months of daily use, my skin was not improving and I found a review of the Clinique 3-step System from Paula Begoun. Her research indicates that all of Clinique's facial soaps in the 3-Step System are too irritating for all skin types. Her research also stated that all Clarifying Lotions (1-4) contain alcohol and Clarifying Lotion 2 contains menthol which make them too irritating for all skin types. 

I never thought that my skin care products were the cause of my flaky skin and break outs. Apparently, the products dried out my skin making it flaky in some areas and in response, my skin started producing more oil to compensate for the dryness-which made me break out in other areas. I switched to Paula's Choice facial products and I occasionally use Cetaphil. After I made the switch, my skin slowly began recovering. 

Unfortunately, now I have some acne scars on my cheeks as a result of using the Clinique 3-step system. It makes me sad because before, my skin was healthy and for the most part clear. I do want to be fair to Clinique. They have some great products---I use their City Block Sheer SPF 15, Advanced Stop Signs Eye SPF 15 and I wear Clinique Happy perfume which smells amazing. 

I hope this review proves helpful to other women so you don't have to go through what I went through! Clinique does have some great products in their line, but they do need to  reformulate their 3-Step Skin Care System."

The reviews here have all stated that this is a cute keychain, that the gloss is nice and that the colors are pretty. All very true. I got my keychain in the Pixie tones and they're girly and pretty and I was feeling pretty cool about it. However, for me, the disenchantment came with the mechanics of it. 

Now, I've always been a fairly careful person, I'm not klutzy nor do I drop or lose things. My keys are as normal as a standard set of keys can be, I never dropped them or banged them against stuff any more that's normal and yet, after less than a week the keychain hinges had broken twice. The first time I was able to make a little mess of superglue and scotch tape and managed to rescue it and put it back into almost normal condition, the second time however, I only noticed that the entire thing had fallen completely apart because I saw only half of the keychain remained and my keys were all covered in pink goo. 

How did it come apart like this? I honestly have no idea as my keys had only made the very normal trajectory between the ignition and my purse. I can honestly only chalk it up to really, really shoddy craftsmanship which may be adequate for a dresser-top lipgloss but never for something that could get even remotely more movement than that. It was a good idea but too low-quality to be fit for the purpose of a keychain. This is not the way to go for gloss on your keys"

I am a SJP-fan, and I was almost certain I would love the new perfume of this stylish lady.
It isn't released yet in Holland, but I found a sample in Germany where it is already released. I was disappointed. The smell isn't bad, but it's isn't something I would like to smell like. It isn't lovely at all. It is too sporty. I expected something more flowery. The scent reminded me most of deodorant (cheap brands) or toilet-refreshener. So, although I am a SJP-fan, I wouldn't like to smell like her. A pity.
My favourite perfumes are (as a comparison): Beyond Paradise (Estee Lauder), Curious (Britney Spears), Couture! (Moschino), Live (J.Lo), Tumulte (Christian LaCroix), several Escade Limited Edition Perfumes and Gucci Rush 2"

Well, I was NOT impressed.  The scent is so strong and overwhelming that it actually seemed to ""catch"" in my throat.  I accidentally got some on my hand and after four hand washings I could still smell it.  I guess, for those of you who like this perfume, that's probably a good thing.

Anyway, I think this perfume is too ""old lady"" for my taste.  It reminded me of J. Lo's Glow.  Which I also have and don't like.

For comparisons sake, perfumes I do like are Britney Spears' Curious, Clinique Happy, Escada Island Kiss and Lucky You"

Application is difficult, mistakes are almost impossible to correct even if done immediately, and I can't soften the line (it *is* smudgeproof).  If you are used to a brush-on-liquid-liner, have a very steady hand, and want a dramatic look, this might work for you.  I prefer a softer line, so this didn't.

Also, it almost completely flaked off over the course of the day.

I'm giving it two stars because it really is smudge-proof, no sliding or transferring.  I didn't have the dark shadows from smudging but I did have flakes, so I'm still not happy with it.

I had been using Clinique for years, merely because it was affordable and a lot of people I knew used it. However, every time I took pictures I couldn't help but cringe after I saw the way my face looked. I'm a naturally tan person, but when I wore Clinique's foundation (I used Honey 07) it would make my face look extremely pale and ghostly, compared to the rest of my body. It got to the point where I got so upset that I went back to the Clinique counter at Macy's and insisted this just couldn't be the right color for me. They insisted it was the correct color and didn't even bother trying new shades on me, even though I had gone back a couple different times. 

Overall, I was really miserable with this product. As a lady, I want to look my best. I definitely don't want to look like someone who doesn't know how to put her makeup on, but whenever I took pictures and saw the way I looked, I couldn't help but think everyone was thinking that. 

For those of you who may be having my same problem, I recommend switching over to Laura Mercier. I made the switch and it's been the best makeup decision of my life. My face has never looked better"

I have used Fekkai products before, and their okay.  Certainly not worth the over inflated price tag.  But I read the reviews for this product and thought it might be the perfect solution for my hair during the winter months.  Wrong answer!  This product is very thick, too thick for me to spread through my hair without putting some work into it.  Conditioners and hair masks should be well, conditioning.  I left this hair mask in the required 20 minutes, and it did nothing.  In fact, I had to go back through my hair with my $6.00 Pantene conditioner just to make my hair manageable.  I also have to wonder what the purpose is of putting pieces of nut shells into a product that is supposed to condition hair?  All those pieces are going to do is rough up your hair cuticle.

I have very thick, coarse, wavy hair and trying to manage it is a nightmare! Before using Fekkai's Luscious Curls lotion, I was using Aveda's Be Curly Lotion and Matrix's Curl.Life contouring creme. Both of the latter products work very well with my hair. I don't like to blow dry my hair (too time-consuming), so I just air dry it. Without blow drying, whether I'm using Aveda or Matrix, the results are great! My hair is smooth, shiny, and less frizzy.

I had never used Fekkai's products before, but decided to give this one a try. Everything Luscious Curl Enhancing Lotion claimed to do, didn't do for my hair. In fact, it actually made my hair worst! It became stiffer, drier looking, frizzier. In addition, my wavy hair, (usually bouncy and alive), became flat and dull. Also, I didn't like the scent of this particular curling lotion. It was very strong smelling and made me nauseous.  

Because of my very poor experience with Fekkai's Luscious Curls lotion, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I think I'll stick to the Aveda and Matrix curling lotions, since they are much more compatible with my hair."

A friend of mine all of a sudden looks 10 years younger, beautiful, glowing poreless skin without needing any foundation so I asked her what she was using.  This was one of her key products and she said it took about 2 months for the effect to really be noticeable.  

Unfortunately I can't use it enough to find out.  First I tried appplying it around my eyes, on my forehead and above my upper lip.  I broke out in really deep cystic acne in those areas after about 4 days.  I started relegating the application only to the eye area and even that is now having a horrible reaction.  I look like I've got insect bites under my eyes, or like I've been punched out.  Yuck.  It's gotta be some kind of allergic reaction.

I used Stay Beige (which I lightly patted on my face on top of Clinique's superfit liquid makeup - I have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. I also hated how Clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades, so that I had to settle for Honey in the liquid and Beige in the powder. As much as I went back to Macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades, they just wouldn't listen. Either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade, or they were convinced I was making a big deal out of nothing. Instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which I shouldn't have to do in the first place) I just switched to a different makeup line: Laura Mercier, which I am VERY happy with.

I've had many other friends who were unhappy with Clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand, as well. I'm not trying to knock the product. I'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people I know. I would definitely NOT recommend Clinique to anyone. I'd rather pay a little more and get better results rather than settle for a $20 product just because it's affordable."

Larosa,,"Any manufacturer that doesn't fully label their product should not be trusted. I do not see a list of ingredients here (but most nail polishes don't bother to do this anyway). The problem I see is this...this nail polish totes that it's safe to use during pregnancy due to the fact that it doesn't contain the above ingredients, but what DOES it contain instead? If it wears well, doesn't peel, give good color coverage, it's got to contain something in the offending ingredient's place, logically. 

Please ask yourself this before you sigh relief and Add to Basket! Phthalates, for example, are a class of industrial plasticizers that were invented in the 1930s. They are often used in nail polish because they make nail polish flexible, and they are used in other products because they help bleed the chemicals of fragrances and help lotion better penetrate the skin. They aren't required to be labeled on the products. Lab animals given dibutyl phthalate had higher numbers of offspring with birth defects, especially of the male reproductive system. A nail polish may not contain phthalates (and brag about it), but may contain a related plasticizer that essentially is just as harmful. Does this contain phthalic anhydride, a toxic chemical hardener? How about FD&C color, such as Yellow 5? It's a petroleum-based color that is also questionable when it comes to safety. 

Basically put, no nail polish is safe during pregnancy. On top of that, while your at it you should review every lotion, foundation product, etc that you use if you're concerned about things like this. I think it's great to be careful - more power to you - but be fully informed, not partially. Companies prey on our worst fears, and what is worse than harming our babies? If this product is so great, let's see an ingredients list (and all cosmetics should do the same, while I'm sounding off on the subject!) "

I should have been suspicious when on the label it says you can make pudding from this as well...which should have alerted me right off the bat that there are other ingredients in the tin--not just chocolate and some sugar...it must be cornstarch.

Marie Belle makes a big deal of the fact that this is NOT cocoa, but cacao...that's why I fell for the hype...but in the end, it's the flavor that counts, and this one...I guess because of the corn starch...has a strange ""mouth feel"" and flavor that I find unpleasant.

I find the French brand  L'Ancienne  far superior...and my favorite drinking chocolate is 
Charbonnell et Walker, which is not for sale (yet) on Amazon"

Since they don't sell Chocolovers anywhere near where I live I decided to order it from Sephora.com in the US.  First of all I thought the price was fairly reasonable for 1.7oz bottle (a very nice bottle and package, if I might add), it cost me around $50 CDN.  I was so excited when my order came in today that I quickly opened up the bottle and gave it a sniff.  Ahhh the sickeningly sweet smell of disappointment.  I don't know what I had been expecting, maybe something more like milk chocolate, but what I got was a strong citrus/cocoa powder burst fading into a VERY strong and sweet smell almost like turkish delights or raspberries and chocolate with a hint of musk.  This may sound good, but for as much of a fan of sweet candy/foody smells as I am, I found this one too overpowering and it seriously made me sick.  Right now all I can smell is a sickly sweetness and the smell of flat Seven Up.  On the plus side it has stopped completely my cravings for sweets.  I think if I were trying to diet I would wear this scent everyday.  I think I will keep it in the hopes that it will grow on me because I really love the look of the bottle and the box it came in.  I am also going to try and layer it with a cocoa body lotion in hopes that it will tame down some of the sweetness.  The bottom line is try before you buy"

I was super excited because I thought to myself, ""shoot, one pass instead of two...""  Not quite.  For starters the razor is bulking and plain heavy.  And not the kind of heavy I'm comfortable with trying to shave as I shouldn't feel I might drop the darn thing.  I started on 1 the first day to get a handle on the razor.  Not a good shave, missed alot of spots and patches of hair.  So day two I went to level 2 on the razor.  Same story, second verse.  It left patches and didn't shave well in some areas.  2.5 the areas got smaller but still...they were there.  Went to a 3 setting on the razor and almost mangled myself.  So for the next week I went back to a 2.5 and did it more consistantly, still gave me a crappy shave.  I give this one star because if it's supposed to be a better razor than anything before it, there shouldn't be a learning curve from one double edge to another.  At least not one this severe.  I get a way better shave using my merkur classic and I really think at least for me, this is the way to go.  I say use caution on the Merkur Futur.  I also say if you're already getting a good shave with a double edge you have, don't buy a new style for the sake of buying a new style.  If you're double edge gets old...buy a new one of the same kind.  Only a suggestion. "

She said that while it lathered nicely, it felt like it stripped her hair and when it rinsed out, it left her hair overly 'squeeky' and tangled.  The end result once her hair was dried (after using conditioner, too), was that it was a lighter shade of blonde, very fly-away, and dry feeling.  She was hoping for smoother, easier to manage hair.  We debated purchasing this shampoo because of its high cost, and I have to say we are extremely disappointed.  The claims were hype, and the results were not delivered.  Her hair was by no means 'fried' or severely damaged, so I fully expected her to have some more manageable locks after using the product, based on its claims.

I remember it smelling great and being endorsed by celebrities as the ""it"" shampoo for treating dry, unruly tresses. The other day, I saw this shampoo on the clearance shelf at Meijers and regrettably made an impulse purchase.  Even at clearance price, this shampoo was still expensive. 

I have very thick, wavy, and somewhat dry hair that needs lots of conditioning products--when I checked out the ingredients (after I bought the shampoo), I groaned inwardly. Almost all of the ingredients (with the exception of water) is on the Aubrey Organics' ""ingredients to be avoided"" list (that is, they are considered toxic).  Like Aubrey Organics, other reputable natural beauty manufacturers suggest avoiding parabens as preservatives because they are mildly estrogenic and can be absorbed through the skin. This shampoo has six different types of parabens--methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc.     

If a product has such a steep asking price, then you would think that its manufacturers would put forth a better formula, incorporating non-toxic, natural ingredients (like Aveda, Biolage, and Biosilk).  At least Suave and V05 (bargain-priced shampoos) can boast about having vitamins and silk amino acids in their formulas (though many of their other ingredients are also found on the ""to be avoided"" list).

The one thing I will say for it is that the color blended well with my skin. In the bottle it looked like it would be way too dark, so I was surprised by that. It looks like there might be a little wiggle room as far as choosing the correct shade with this one. The coverage is not very good, though. You can put a little extra on without it looking cakey, but it doesn't cover as well as say Lancome's Photogenic foundation. I also highly doubt that it is waterproof. Water-resistant, maybe. Defintely not waterproof. It rubbed off pretty easily with a dry kleenex and even more came off with a wet one. When I tried CoverBlend's water resistant makeup I had to use soap to get it off. The coverage was also much better. Unfortunately they don't offer many shades in the Leg & Body Makeup. I also found that the dew finish did not work for my skin. I have combination skin and tend to have a shiny t-zone. This foundation left me with a shiny nose and forehead. It also made the rest of my face feel slightly oily, which it normally does not. Overall I would say this foundation is a very poor value and I will defintely be returning it to Sephora. At least Sephora has free returns. :"

First of all, I gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. However, this product is sticky. VERY sticky! It does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. Not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. When I wear a lip gloss, I want to be soft and smooth feeling. I want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak. 

Also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. This will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. Very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!

I couldn't figure out why the box was so heavy.  They are just socks, right?  Right??  Well, they aren't.  The insides are coated with some sort of heavy-duty silicone.

Hence the soft feet.  And very warm feet.  They'll be good for winter.

The other gripe I have is that they don't come with washing instructions.  Great.  These socks have one purpose in life, and that is to make your feet sweat and then refuse to be washed.  I found that handwashing them in the sink with some handsoap works fine.  For now, anyway.  I don't think they belong in the washing machine.  A laundry horror story is likely to ensue.    "

I used Stay Beige (which I lightly patted on my face on top of Clinique's superfit liquid makeup - I have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. I also hated how Clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades, so that I had to settle for Honey in the liquid and Beige in the powder. As much as I went back to Macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades, they just wouldn't listen. Either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade, or they were convinced I was making a big deal out of nothing. Instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which I shouldn't have to do in the first place) I just switched to a different makeup line: Laura Mercier, which I am VERY happy with.

I've had many other friends who were unhappy with Clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand, as well. I'm not trying to knock the product. I'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people I know. I would definitely NOT recommend Clinique to anyone. I'd rather pay a little more and get better results rather than settle for a $20 product just because it's affordable."

First of all, I gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. However, this product is sticky. VERY sticky! It does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. Not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. When I wear a lip gloss, I want to be soft and smooth feeling. I want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak. 

Also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. This will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. Very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!

Rinse with warm water. Careful not to get it in your eyes, as I did once while rinsing it off in the shower. This scrub does an adequate job of exfoliating and retexturizing skin. But it's unsuitable for sensitive skin, and it stinks to high heaven. It contains menthol, which burns skin and clears the sinuses at no extra charge. Having so much menthol so close to my nose is not a good thing. Of course, it is ""100% Fragrance Free"" according to Clinique, meaning that the smell of menthol is unadulterated by perfumes. The scrub also contains salicylic acid, so beware that this might be too drying for some skin types, especially if used frequently. The performance isn't bad. The olfactory aesthetics are atrocious.

The original product while greasy and a bit of a pain to use, exfoliates almost as well as professional microdermabrasion and does not irritate - even with daily use. A few years ago I spent the summer neglecting to use my sun block. Needless to say, my skin became a mess (dull, blotchy, discolorations, rough, flaky, etc.). I began my basic Clinique regimen (Mild Facial Soap, Clarifying lotion #2, Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion, and the Seven Day Srub). In less than two weeks I saw a huge difference, my skin was back to normal. I had tried the Exfoliating Scrub later, since I hated to deal with the original ""seven day"" but soon went back to it as it truly works best.

That was all fine and dandy, but it didn't leave my nails all that dry, nor did it leave them shiny. In fact, they were less shiny than the shiny topcoats I use. 

I also had the worse case of bedsheet wrinkles embedded in my manicure that night after using this product - could be unrelated, but I've never seen so many creases and smudges in my nails when I woke up and I let them dry for a few hours after painting them!

I've been unable to get any lather from this bar, although admittedly I do have very hard water where I live. I read that previous reviewers complained about how long this soap lasts.

The smell is a very strong herbal;  like the kind you would add to an Italian pasta dish.   Not very appealing!  There is some complexity to the scent, but it's so overshadowed by the herb smell to really come through.  On the plus side,  the color is beautiful (a rich, dark purple) and the lather is equally lovely to look at.  If you like true herbal scents, then you should give this a try.

I've been using drug store relaxers for over 30 years (CrÃ¨me of Nature, TCB, Dark & Lovely, Revlon Realistic) whatever is ""on sale"" with satisfying results.   These products leave my hair evenly straight and shiny but hard and stiff immediately after the process.  I usually wash my hair after a few days (I like to give it a rest after relaxing) and use a good conditioner to soften and detangle.  From there I am able to go about 12 weeks before having to retouch.  In general my hair is healthy and responds well to straightners.  My biggest expense is with conditioning products to maintain my hair.  I'll try anything and spend any amount if it works well on my hair.  I have great success with Frederic Fekkai products and love Phytodefrisant Botanical Hair Relaxing Balm...this stuff is amazing if you like to wash and go (air dry) and it works wonders with blow drying/flat ironing too.  (Bumble and Bumble Styling Spray is another amazing product for great flat ironing results.)

I forked out $60 to try Phtyo2 after reading all the rave reviews.  I am satisfied with the outcome but not blown away.  Yes, Phyto2 did not smell bad, it did not burn my scalp and it did straighten my hair but no better than Dark and Lovely or TCB, and my hair was still hard and stiff afterward.

It has been several weeks and my hair is doing great, but again no different from when I use Dark & Lovely.  I guess I am lucky that my hair responds well to ANY type of relaxer so I doubt I'll be spending another $60 for Phyto2...I'd rather buy two tubes of Phytodefrisant Balm and continue to with my $7.99 drug store brands.  I hope this helps someone with similar hair as mine.  If you do well with drug store brands, Phyto results are not that different...spend the money on their other products that nourish and condition your hair"

I bought it at a big upscale department store and used it that night.  Now that winter is approaching, my skin gets a little wacky at times.

The product comes out as a gel but becomes creamy as you apply it on the damp skin.  The instructions are to leave it on until a ""full froth"" forms (approximately 5 minutes), then rinse off.

The cream began to take on the consistency of foam after about 2 minutes, and at the end of 5 minutes the foam was beginning to dissipate and leave big empty patches on my skin, so I rinsed it off.  

My skin didn't look any different when done.  It didn't feel any different when done.  For $52 I expected at least some type of visible change - even if it made my skin redder, or plumper, or something.

One night i styed up late and that Murad infomercial came on and it looked pretty convincing since there where no celebritys advertising it and they even compared it to proactiv, so i tough i would give it a try so i ordered it online the next day.

Couple Of Days later i received the package and i was pretty exited so i began to use it and liked the overall feel of it. few days pass by and i wake up one morning with all these little white heads in my upper chin and i was immidiately grossed out but since they said it was normal due to purging i didnt worry much, one week later it got worse and even began breaking out in places i hadnt before like in my forehead. I knew somethign wasnt right so i went online and started reading other custumer reviews and was shocked at the similaruty of thwe problem so i freaked out and decided to stop using it because it got so bad to the point where i didnt wanna be seen and on top of that it became very painful both physically and mentally i becamed sorth of depressed about the situation i sorth of felt like a teen going trough puberty again.

I paid to have the Murad Acne Complex expedited to me because I was so anxious to get on to 'beautiful, clear skin.'

It'd be appropriate for preteens, but not grown women, then again, should I be surprised? I suppose the scent caters well to Spears' followers, 12 year olds"

like all the LUSH bubble bars, this definitely packs the bubbles in a small amount. i just have buyers remorse because i now have this oversized bar (and it is a very big bar), and i can only use bits of it when my fiance is out of town because he gets an allergic reaction to the strong strong STRONG smell. 
i think the upside is that it seems like the scent isn't nearly so strong once you're actually *in* the bath. or maybe by then your olfactory senses are so overwhelmed you just can't tell the difference anymore.
so yeah, if you love love LOOOOOOOOVE patchouli, then this is truly the bath bar for you. otherwise, i'd steer clear and go for something gentler. the hot milk bubble bar is the opposite of this bar, in that it's really gentle on the nose. and any of the jasmine flavored products would also be a better recommendation than this one.

Cons

Conditioner is really thick and difficult to get out of the bottle. The best solution for this is to let the bottle sit upside down. 

Pros

Smells DAMN good. I'm not a big fan of fruity/coconut aromas, but I like this particular smell so much that I might need to go to rehab sometime in the future. 


Bottom Line: Although this conditioner is difficult to get out of the bottle, it smells really good. Whether or not it will work for your hair, the only way to know is to try it. And even if ot doesn't work for your hair...it's worth the 20 bucks just to open it up and smell it every now and then. =)"

I washed my hair, blew it dry, most of the way, then rubbed the product in my hands and lightly distributed it throughout my hair.  The best way for me to describe it, is that, it is like a creamy hairspray.  Yes, it is tacky, like hairspray can be, but that's how it helps you get the style you want.  What I like about how it works on my hair, is that it really tamed the frizzes and brought down the ""big"" hair look that I usually have after blowing my thick hair dry.  I think it would also work well on the days that I blow my hair out.  I would probably blow it out first, then apply some dirt to help tame and smooth it.  I can see where it might make thinner, straighter hair a bit limp, so be careful not to use very much.

Edit:  I think it is best to apply to slightly damp hair, that might help with the people that are having trouble applying it to completely dry hair"

Great Alternative To The Famous Chi,"May 16, 2005",pandyland,"1""","I had the Chi Turbo (1""), but I got worried after reading some reviews about it being unreliable.  So part of the reason I wanted to buy the T3 iron was that it comes with a 4-YEAR comprehensive warranty.  The other difference is that the solid-ceramic plates are ""infused"" with tourmaline which I found intriguing.

1-3/8"" wide plates are the perfect width for my long-ish hair.  (I've used a 2 inch wide iron, which I found harder to maneuver.)  It heats up fast, and stays hot.  It does a great job gripping the hair without snagging.  My hair stays silky and straight all day, and does not feel damaged after a while, like it did with cheaper irons I've used in the past.

Another thing that this iron does that other irons do not do as well - it really curls.  It has heat vents along the sides of the plates that lets you curl your hair by twisting it near the root and pulling it through (different from the usual method of gripping the ends of the strands and then winding up).  It creates a springy curl better than any flat iron I've used.  (However, the heating vents make the exterior of the iron hotter to the touch.  So there is a drawback to this function.)

Overall, I enjoy using this flat iron.  Very happy with this purchase.

ETA: I've learned that HairArt will not honor the warranty unless you buy it from an authorized distributor (e.g., Sephora). So you might want to check that before you place your order"

I bought it, went straight to my bathroom, and washed my hair. The shampoo did not lather, which I expected considering there is no harsh detergents or sodium lauryl sulfate. The conditioner was a very light, thin substance. Definitely not thick. 
Finale-Dried my hair, and right there, I knew that this product is definitely the BEST hair product BY FAR, that I have ever used. My hair, is very damaged, brittle and FULL of split ends. This product made my hair, very very full, FULL of shine, and very soft. My hair was beautiful for days....
Last test.. going to work. As soon as I put my hair down from a pony tail (I'm a waitress), INSTANTLY everyone noticed my hair. They asked ""what did you do?? your hair is soo beautiful"".. I told them ""40 dollar shampoo and conditioner"" WELL WORTH THE COST. Definitely a salon in a bottle. Now my worst fear is that it will be discontinued for any reason.

Great Alternative To The Famous Chi,"May 16, 2005",pandyland,"1""","I had the Chi Turbo (1""), but I got worried after reading some reviews about it being unreliable.  So part of the reason I wanted to buy the T3 iron was that it comes with a 4-YEAR comprehensive warranty.  The other difference is that the solid-ceramic plates are ""infused"" with tourmaline which I found intriguing.

1-3/8"" wide plates are the perfect width for my long-ish hair.  (I've used a 2 inch wide iron, which I found harder to maneuver.)  It heats up fast, and stays hot.  It does a great job gripping the hair without snagging.  My hair stays silky and straight all day, and does not feel damaged after a while, like it did with cheaper irons I've used in the past.

Another thing that this iron does that other irons do not do as well - it really curls.  It has heat vents along the sides of the plates that lets you curl your hair by twisting it near the root and pulling it through (different from the usual method of gripping the ends of the strands and then winding up).  It creates a springy curl better than any flat iron I've used.  (However, the heating vents make the exterior of the iron hotter to the touch.  So there is a drawback to this function.)

Overall, I enjoy using this flat iron.  Very happy with this purchase.

ETA: I've learned that HairArt will not honor the warranty unless you buy it from an authorized distributor (e.g., Sephora). So you might want to check that before you place your order"

And I tell you, I have never been happier using a hair dryer. My hair started looking better and less damaged in the first few weeks itself. It has become smooth and silky and has a healthy glow.  Though the weight and the time taken were almost similar to my old model, the after effect is worth the price paid. The product does come with a 4-year warranty which is an added advantage to justify the exorbitant price.

That is the scent of this ""fun to take a bath before breakfast"" experience. 

The fresh scent of Lemon and Sweet Wild Orange mingles with Bergamot and Gardenia extract. The result of this bath is a refreshing - I can face the day feeling. If you want to enhance the experience, try the Happy Hippy shower gel with grapefruit. The I Love Juicy Shampoo and Veganese Conditioner also complete the citrus experience. 

If you think the petals in this bath bombs are fun (the ones in my bath slipped right down the drain), wait until you try the Big Blue experience with seaweed. It does take an adventurous spirit to try some of these items, but as an official LUSH addict, I tend to dive into the experiences with abandon.

But only in a good way! I first encountered this scent walking past the fragrance counter at the mall many years ago. At the time, it seemed that all the fragrances for men were heavy musks, orientals, spices, etc. This was...er...fruity. (I see you cringing!) It's lemony. Like a puff of lemon cake. A breeze over a lemon field in Tuscany. (are there fields of lemons in Tuscany? I don't know, but it's a mental pic, go with it!) A spritz of cologne following a bit of aftershave balm is a sure recipe to get yourself sniffed and cuddled. It doesn't bash you over the head with macho tones- it lures with tingling tartness. I have yet to meet a woman who dislikes the scent. And yes, I do steal it from my husband sometimes! On him (a light eyed blond) it stays true to the bottle scent, but on me (brunette with oily skin) it morphs to something with vanilla notes in the lemon. I think it's a great ""safe"" gift for people who aren't sure what cologne to buy for a new male friend.
I gave it four stars, because the cologne does need to be reapplied frequently to maintain a viable scent. The fragrance lasts for approximately four hours. But if you can't get noticed for your lemony deliciousness in four hours, you have more problems than a cologne will fix. (brush your teeth!) LAUGH!! :"

This is the tipe of mascara which lengthens the lashes not volumises it (I think Dr. Hauschka doesn't make that kind). When it's time to wash it off it comes off very easy (spares your lashes).

Unfortunately I couldn't change my 4 star recommendation to 2...and this is a follow up on my previous review. 
When I'd been using this mascara for about 2 weeks I noticed that it started to flake except for some reason the flakes ended up in my eyes, not on my cheek or under my eyes. First I didn't know it was the mascara..I thought something went into my eyes but every single time I applied, it happened. Not straight away..but in about 2-3 hours later..This was very frustrating...I tried to put less of this product on my lashes but then I looked like I had nothing on. At this point I still had some flaking, not as bad as before, but it was still enough to hurt my eyes..so I just stopped using this product all together.
The only reason why I'd give 2 stars for this product instead of 1 because it's natural and organic...and I appriciate that fact. But that's about it.
I really wanted to like this product so I am very disappointed, it wasn't cheap either. Dr. Hauschka need to improve the quality of this product"

Their products are all, without fail, of superior quality.  The Satsuma line especially is wonderful, and is my favorite scent from the Body Shop.  It is the juicy fresh smell of tangerines/oranges.  I have read some reviews that it reminds people of a creamsicle type scent but I completely disagree with that. I have never liked creamsicle scents and I love Satsuma.  It is not cloying or too sweet.  It is a very pure scent and I always feel clean and beautiful while wearing it.  One other thing to note about this product...  I do not always like perfume oils because the scent is not always accurate when compared to other products in the same line.  I am not sure if this is because sometimes the oils are so concentrated that they smell like ""too much"".  The Satsuma oil is not like that at all - it smells true to the rest of the line.  The scent also lasts for a long time after being applied, due to the fact that it is a perfume oil.  A little goes a long way - I would not be surprised if the bottle lasted for over a year.  I love this product and give it my highest recommendation.  "

I have never had that problem with this scent. it's smells delicious in the bottle and on the skin, that is if you like citrus. It smells like a fresh, ripe Orange, with the slightest hint of spice. The man in my life finds it quite cuddle worthy. If you are not familiar with perfume oils, just somthing to note. they are highly concentrated, a little goes a long way. it also phases nicely, from intense to pleasently subtle and is long lasting. Another bonus is that there are only few ingredients, so it's less likely to irritate sensitive skin. One bottle will last and last, there is a flexable applicator wand inside the lid. I really can't say enough about this wonderful fragrance"

(Hair) Solid Shampoo Bar by LUSH: Beauty,beauty,2 of 2,4.0,Great shampoo that could be just a little better,"February 27, 2007",J. A. Odell,"Connecticut, USA","My hair tends to fall out due to me not eating enough protein, so NEW! (Hair) is a lifesaver.  As others have said, it lathers like you wouldn't believe -- you really only need to roll it in your hands two or three times to get enough for a thick lather -- and it has an amazing scent.  (Sniffing the bar can actually be a bit addictive...you can smell it really strongly even before you open the box!)  I've found that keeping it in a small lightly covered dish in my bedroom, away from the moisture of the bathroom, is the best way to preserve it for a while.  (Also, it works as an accidental room freshener -- seriously, the smell is incredible!)

My only wish is that the scent would last a little longer in my hair, since it doesn't really stick, even right after showering, unless I use a lot of lather, and that ends up being expensive since then the bar doesn't last as long.  Most of the time, there isn't even much of a hint, whereas other Lush shampoos can make your hair smell wonderful, even a bit overpowering, for days.

Also, unlike some of the other Lush products, it leaves my hair fairly flat.  It's true that it helps with making hair really soft and shiny, but it seems to have the opposite effect when it comes to volume, and that's not so good when you're already having some hair loss.  Using a mostly scent-free conditioner after is almsot necessary, at least in my experience.

I think NEW! (Hair) is a terrific shampoo for its hair-restoring qualities and general sniffability, but at the same time, it could be a little better with its more cosmetic qualities.  Buy it more for the former than the latter if you want the most enjoyment and value out of it.  And if you do have hair loss, trust me -- the price is worth it"

It says it's fragrance free, but it's got a small (very very very small) hint of lemon perhaps?  You only need a liberal amount and you're good to go.  Moisture is retained with glycerin and it soothes with aloe and chamomile (Mmmm).  If you're looking for subtle, yet tasteful facial lotion that's made for men, you've gota try this.  It's even allergy tested.  Not to mention, part of the proceeds are donated to prostate cancer research. "

I place mine in the microwave for 15 seconds while I apply moisturizer to my hands.  Slide the gloves onto your hands as soon as the microwave is finished.  In 15 minutes you have a quick, but effective moisturizing treatment.  If your hands are really dry you could do the same thing but leave them on overnight.  I found the overnight option to be a little warm on my hands.  But, it might work fine for you.

These socks are 94% cotton and 6% Spandex.  They can be machine washed and tumbled dried.  I have not found it necessary launder them each time I use them.  I use a light moisturizer (Cetaphil), so you might have a different experience if you use a heavier product to moisturize.

I would highly recommend this product."

Lipglass feels good on your lips, as if it contained some emollients. And (this is a big AND) it's not tacky or sticky. 

The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. 

Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. 

Enjoy!

B000FWAHVA:a_very_different_mascara-i_love_it!!!:sammy_madison,B000FWAHVA,philosophy the supernatural lash wrap mascara: Beauty,beauty,11 of 11,5.0,A very different mascara-I love it!!!,"July 7, 2006",Sammy Madison,USA,"I changed this review from when I first wrote it a couple of weeks ago.  When I first wrote it, the title was ""I like it"".  Now I've changed it to ""I love it!!!"" because the more I use it, the more sure I am that I will not EVER buy regular mascara again.  This mascara will NOT smudge!  It will not leave ""racoon eyes"" under your lash line.  It goes on where you put it and stays there until you take it off.  It also does not irritate my eyes.  I never thought I would find a mascara that didn't make me want to rub and rub my eyes.  I hate rubbing my eyes because I know it makes them baggy and makes wrinkles.  I have been seeing mascara which forms a tube around the lash advertised in high-end catalogs lately, and have been intrigued.  When I found out Philosophy, a brand I really respect, had this type of mascara available, I had to order it right away.  As soon as the UPS man brought it, I applied it.  It makes your lashes look really long!  They have a lot of individual definition, and show up as very distinct.  This mascara doesn't ""fatten"" the lashes, but it lengthens them so much, and it is a much cleaner look than the lash thickening mascara I have been using.  I really like the look, and the mascara does not smudge, or rinse off easily in water.  It seems to stay on really well, without the clumpy, greasy feeling I get from waterproof mascara.  It comes off neatly in little chunks when you rub a little ""Purity Made Simple"" cleanser on it.  I really like this mascara, and I will buy it again.  Actually I am going to throw out all my other kinds of mascara and only get this kind"

I'm a teenager who has a slight problem with acne, so that's why I bought the Neutrogena Acne Wash instead, which has salicylic acid that will help for acne. 
By itself, the acne wash does not work, but so far with the Clinique, I have not broken out at all! Not a single pimple. Everything is smooth and toned. I love my skin and it GLOWS.
I recommend getting the milder lotion for people with fairer and more sensitive skin, as this is known to peel and cause redness to some.
The salicylic acid is necessary for me and my light breaks-out-during-THAT-time-of-month skin. So if you do not have an acne problem, I think any soap is alright. 

To anyone who is worried about spending too much money:
If it does not work for you, there is a guarantee that lets ou get all your money back. It's great"

If you enjoy the Bergamot in this product, it is also in Lush The Olive Branch and The Comforter Bubble Bar. Cynthia Sylvia Stout shampoo and Veganese conditioner go well with this experience since they are also citrusy. 

I will agree, this doesn't exactly have a blackberry scent, but it is a beautiful violet colored bath that will impress with its calming and skin healing properties.

I, however, buy it because for the five years or so that I have used this product, I have gotten a LOT of compliments about the firmness of my skin, and since I have started using it my skin has actually become LESS oily than when I first started using it.  

I first purchased this product because of some damage I had done to my skin using a popular acne product.  My skin looked and felt as though I had been burned by acid.  I promptly stopped using that product and purchased this cream along with the cream cleanser because I hoped these products would be soothing.  They definitely were.  Within a matter of weeks my skin started to feel better.  Moreoever, it took on a plump, more youthful appearance (no sagging!).  Within a month or so, my skin was much less oily than it had been.  

Since I first purchased this product I have strayed but have always come back.  In the winter I use the heavier nightcream and have experienced the same results.  The regular cream is pink in color and does not smell of perfume.  Texture wise it is heavier than a lotion but still feels slippery to the touch.  I highly recommend you try this cream"

The sweet vanilla fragrance is blended with perfumes and the result is something like a spicy vanilla and strawberry milkshake. Can I say yum? 

This is absolutely delish and I think they may have added a little cinnamon to the mix. I love keeping lush soaps by the sink because they don't seem to dry out my hands as much as gel soaps. This one is perfect in combination with the Smitten hand cream. 

Rock Star soap left me dreaming about buying other ""vanilla"" themed items like Think Pink (which I tried), Creamy Candy (a bubble bar), Sympathy for the Skin (which I'm dying to try) and Honey Trap (which I just tossed recklessly into my shopping cart). Candy Fluff sounds like it would go well with this experience. If you love this soaps creamy consistency, Gratuitous Violets, Sultana of Soap and Alkmaar will impress. 

Any chance the vanilla toothpaste will be listed here soon? Wish, wish...

the reviewer who said this only lasts a week must use a TON of soap (though who could blame her with a soap like this?)or take multiple baths/showers a day, because i have used it for a week and it doesn't look any smaller than when i first opened it. it REALLY helps to unwrap soap as soon as you get it so it can air harden before you use it. this helps it last longer."

If this is your first time buying Lush soap online, be forewarned. You will receive a piece that is about 1"" thick and 4-5"" long. In other words, you will be receiving a fairly small piece of soap. If you have a Lush store near you, I strongly recommend that you go and smell the huge chunks of soap they have on display. Once you find a scent you like, buy a Â½ lb brick of it. It will cost a little over $20, but it is worth it if you find a soap you love. I also find that it is easier to experience the full scent of a soap with a bigger slice. I know that Lush stores are few and far between (the closest one to me is about 35 miles away--not that far, but too far to be convenient), but if you can grab a couple of friends and make a road trip out of it, it's an adventure!

Now, on to Rock Star. What a delightful soap. If you are a fan of the Mmmm....Melting Marshmallows bath melt, then you will also enjoy Rock Star. The scent is the same. It is also the same as Snow Fairy Shower Gel and the Creamy Candy bath melt.  I cannot quite place my finger on the scent. The main ingredient in it is Vanilla absolute, but this smells much more sweet and girly.  There is a definite floral scent lurking under the vanilla, but I am at a loss to try and describe it! It sort of smells like warm cotton candy with a hint of brown sugar. It's the closest I can come to trying to describe the scent.

The scent of Rock Star will linger on your skin for the entire day. It's absolutely wonderful. It also leaves your bathroom smelling wonderfully fresh.  Every time my husband uses the upstairs bathroom, he has to come find me and ask what smells so good in our bathroom. It is a fabulously creamy soap and it lathers quite well. If you have white tile in your bathroom, it will leave a pink lather pile on the tile, but it is easy enough to wash off. 

There are a couple of minor downsides to Rock Star. But they are minor: 

1. It melts way too fast. I just wished it lasted a bit longer.

2. It can leave the skin feeling a bit too squeaky clean. When I first started using Rock Star, I thought it would give me dry skin, but that hasn't been the case. It just feels a bit dry after showering. 

Despite these small issues, Rock Star is the perfect soap to make you feel a bit girly and a bit sexy, all at the same time."

A personal tip I would like to suggest is to spray this perfume or any perfume of your choice on your hair, just two quick sprays and the smell lasts much longer then on your skin. Make sure your hair is dry and styled before doing this. "

Sort of tangy and light and sweet. But as with all that Lush does, there is a depth to this scent that makes it interesting enough to enjoy bathing in time and time again.

The tonka oil in it is good for helping you to forgive yourself and for relaxation, according to the first Lush Times catalog it appeared in, so whenever I am having a bad day or kicking myself for making a silly mistake, I bathe in this and feel better. It also has lavender for relaxation and neroli to uplift the spirits.

The only downside to this bomb is that the scent doesn't linger much at all once you get out of the bath, which is disappointing to me since it smells so good! Still, it is a worthy bath bomb and the cheery pink water and uplifting scent make it one I come back to time and time again"

I have had problematic hormonal acne since the age of 21. I'm 27 now. 

After I graduated from the university and started working a real job, the stress went straight to my face (you all know what I am talking about). Unfortunately for me, I am allergic to benzyl peroxide and I have extremely sensitive skin. I also do not do well with tea tree oils and most sulfur and acidic products (basically anything that can kill acne - leaves my face itchy- either swollen like a tomato or is ineffective and I have painful acne bumps...which would you rather do?).

I was a little hesitant after reading the ingredients and noticed that the cleanser had sulfur in it and there was also a jar of pure salicylic acid for blemishes. But, after using other philosophy products for my hair and body - I decided to give it a try. Hell, what's another 50 bucks if it can clear my acne - and if not I can always send it back.

I started using it about 3 weeks ago and my skin has had a tremendous transformation. I finally feel like my acne is under control. I recommend this product fully and it is my duty to tell everyone this after suffering with relentless acne for so many years. 

The cleanser is awesome and needs to be in a larger size. The blemish serum is extremely drying, so if you are sensitive like me read the directions and take it slow - don't reapply throughout the day, until your skin is ready. The day and night face creams are cool. The day one is kind of like glue and seals in the treatment - the entire day! That's why it works, because it is on your face until night time when you wash (I can even faintly smell the product). Then you use your night hydrogen peroxide cream, yes not benzyl. Yeah, this cream is intense as well. So take it slow until your skin is ready. 

One thing that I do recommend is that if you wear make-up, use the purity cleanser (not in the kit) to initially clean your skin and then use the acne cleanser. That's what I do and it works for me - so I will share it with you.

Another thing I do is I will take a little bit of the hope is not enough SPF moisturizer and put on very little on my super dry areas. Remember this acne kit is intense and you may be prone to drying out and peeling - so some oil-free moisturizer can help hydrate the area around the acne.

Well that's about it. I hope this helps you and let's you know that your acne can be tamed and doesn't have to run your life. 

Take care,

It's not too spicy, not sickeningly sweet. It's not trying to do too much. Just effortless. One thing I like about this, you're not at risk at dousing yourself and offending other noses. I hate smelling or leaving a trail of perfume in the air. This one has restraint. Staying power is debatable but it's such a wonderful, confident woman scent, I gave it 5 stars"

If you are a gourmand/oriental fragrance lover (examples of which include Thierry Mugler's Angel or Angel Innocent, Bvlgari's Omnia, Calvin Klein's Euphoria, or Burberry's Brit - all of which I own and wear regularly without longevity issues - see next paragraph) then I would highly recommend this fragrance.  Sweet, but in a sexy, subtle musky way.  

I would bathe myself in this fragrance if I could.  And I should.  As noted by the previous reviewer, this fragrance is gone in flash.  I give myself about 5 hearty sprays of this in the morning, including two directly misted onto my clothing in an effort to extend the fragrance, but it is gone by noon.  This is truly perplexing.  Every other Giorgio Armani frangrance that I own, including Sensi, Emporio She, and Armani Code for Men (also great for women), can go the distance.  

This is supposed to be Eau de Parfum, but wears very much like Eau de Toilette.  Someone seriously skimped on the oil base.  It that doesn't trouble you terribly, pick this one up.  If you want something similar that will last through the entire day and most of the night, and particularly love the musk component of this fragrance, then I would wholeheartedly recommend checking out Narciso Rodriguez's ""For Her"" or ""Musc for Her"" instead"

This stuff is amazing. From the first time I used it, my hair was shiny and very soft.  

I call it the ""dirty hippy hair stuff"" since it smells like incense.

I always look for a product that not only puts back moisture into my hair, but something that can fortify it as well to prevent more damage.  I've tried almost every single intensive conditioner in the stores and tried a lot in the salons as well, however this one I came across by accident.

My aunty had gone to a Frederic Fekkai promo sale and bought a WHOLE bunch of stuff.  It didn't really do much for her hair, so she passed them on to me to try.  Some of the stuff I wasn't too impressed with, but this hair mask did wonders for my hair!

After just one use, I could totally tell a difference in the feel and texture of my hair.  Usually, I have to straighten or blow dry my hair when its wet to tame it, however this product I didn't have to do too much after.  I let my hair air dry and just put in a anti-frizz cream after, and that was good.

The mask washes out clean (no greasy residue), so this product is really good for weekly restoration.  But from what it seems like, this hair mask (along with all products, I suppose) work for some people and not for others.  Your best bet is to get your hands on a sample size before you shell out the money for a full tube, since it can be kind of expensive"

My hair was bouncy and had lots of volume and was very shiny and curly, the best i have ever seen it! I got a lot of compliments on it too.

I've used it for a little over a year now and I won't use anything else.  I don't know the last time I ever had to use an exfoliating scrub because what this does, is an automatic scrub.  It is gradually sloughing off dead skin cells for you and rendering the use of exfoliaters useless. 
I must say, it has a natural funky smell but you do adapt to that very quickly and won't notice it after a while.  You use it once a day for the first two weeks (while your skin gets used to it) and then twice a day thereafter if you want.  I only use it at night and a sunscreen throughout the day because the skin is a little more sensitive to the sun.
Caution - this is an acid cream.  I once had a minor paper cut on my finger (the same that I use to dip into the pot) and I still get tears in my eyes thinking of the pain I was in.  
This is an excellent cream and I strongly recommend it.  It won't get rid of wrinkles (you have to know that there is practically NOTHING on the market that will get rid of them) but it will soften the look of wrinkles and it will give your skin a beautiful softness and glow.

2. Colors are not garish - you won't be throwing them out next season.  Not to say that they are boring, just timeless and well thought out.
3. They last a long time.  Not all day, but I really hate those ""all day"" lip colors.  By mid-day, my lips are so dry and gross-flakey.  I've thrown away more of those cruddy ""all day"" lip colors than I care to remember.  Back to the point, my Laura lipstick easily lasts me through a 2-hour presentation to a client.

Proactive does not work on my face instead it irritates and get worst.
Try to wash your face with Dove skin soap for more than 1hr to soften your face and remove the pus. Then, path it dry and use Zeno, and don't over use this product because it might hurt and burn your skin.
Failure to use this product properly might cause 1st Degree burn.

Never use any chemicals on your face while using this product.

For excessive large pimples, I see some people apply a clean duct tape on their face, keep it for 3-8 hrs and remove it.
You would notice that all pus are lying on your face and you just need to clean it using clean water and a skin soap.

Okay. Think ""Carrie"" on TV's enormously successful ""Sex and the City."" She was the gal who dressed to the nines - always with style and glamour. She brings both of those qualities to her first fragrance, ""Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker."" 

It's a unique, almost indescribable blend of classicism, chic, and innocence. There's not a scent like it with top notes of fresh Mandarin, Bergamot, Lavender, and Apple Martini. Vibrant and warm it's a fragrance that caresses the senses. 

Middles notes are Patchouli, tender Paper Whites, and luxe Orchid. These are enhanced by bottom notes of irresistible white amber, sensuous cedar, and the very sultry musk. This is a scent I revel in, and enjoy wearing. 

The bottle is, of course, simple and exquisite, curved with polished glass, ultra feminine. 

Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker is a beautiful, dreamy yet quite alive fragrance appropriate for every occasion.

Applying your bareminerals foundation first, glues it all on.  The included booklet guides you along. 

Being in my 40's, natural looking is the name of the game for me. No glitter, sparkles, heavy eye liners etc.  This kit accomplished that.  I got brave and tried the ""foiling"" effect and fell in love ! The colors did not migrate, the liner stayed in place for over 12 hours, and I had no eye irritation at all.

Do yourself a favor and try this out !  You will never go back to other eye makeup.  I recommend this to everyone I know, you won't be dissappointed "

Chanel Mademoiselle because my mother always taught me to love Chanel and I just prefer that scent to the others. 
And Marc Jacobs because, to be honest, if I had to choose the loveliest, this would be it.  It's lovely and light.  Not too over powering.  Affordable.  And gets tons of compliments.  

Also comes in cute bottle.  :"

Rad ""Sarangels""",CA,"If I had to choose a fragrance that was THE most feminine I've ever smelled, it would be Marc Jacobs.  Yes, it's a gardenia based scent, but definitely not your typical musty, heavy gardenia by any means.  Marc Jacobs is different in that it is a 'wet gardenia', like you're smelling a bunch of gardenias that have been swirling around in a bowl of fresh water.  Intoxicatingly alluring.

The notes of this fragrance are: Gardenia, Wild Muguet, Skin Musk, Cedar, Ginger.  The gardenia in this is faint, but lovely.  It isn't a knock-you-out strong gardenia, but very mellow and mesmerizing.  It'll follow you like a breath of fresh air, and you'll have people sniffing the air you leave behind. :)  If you've ever smelled Michael by Michael Kors, this is DIFFERENT.  Michael is not gardenia, but it is a tuberose scent.  It is very strong, creamy, heavy, and thick.  If you like Michael, you may like Marc Jacobs as your spring/summer alternative.  They're in the same family in terms of florals and such, but different in terms of how they wear.  Marc Jacobs being flowy, and Michael being heavy.  

The 1.7 oz. retails at $65, and the 3.4 oz. at $85.  It's quite expensive, but it does have that brand-name smacked on the front. :)  I think it's worth it.  The lasting power is decent.  Even when you may feel it is gone, it's not, and people will compliment you.

Try it out and see how you like it on your skin"

Sean John Unforgivable is surprisingly good. Masculine, but not too musky or cheap smelling. Now, this is all my boyfriend will wear - and I'm not complaining!

I can't say that this cologne is worth a great deal of hype, but I can say that it has a pleasant and 
disctinctive odor.

The cologne is not something you would wear on a daily basis, but would go very well with a suit on a special occasion. 

On the bad side, along with the cologne's elegant odor comes a slightly feminine aroma. While I am not one to prefer a ""musky"" cologne I could do without smelling like a woman. An additional downside would be it's high cost per ounce... 

Overall, since receiving the cologne as a gift, I am quite pleased with adding this fragrance to my collection. Good job Diddy Daddy Puff..."

The earthy fragrance may appeal to your wilder side if you enjoy the Jungle conditioner which also contains Vetivert oil. Use this conditioner after the Daddy-O shampoo and all you can imagine you are walking through fields of lavender drinking a coconut milkshake. 

I can also recommend the Honey Trap Lip Balm and the Smitten Hand Cream. ""All that Jas"" is also a wonderful product for the bath.

Cousins,"seattle, wa","when I first got the package delivered to me at work, my assistant and I were smelling all the products... this one made both of us scrunch our noses in distaste. But when I got home and actually applied it to my hair, it smelled nothing like the nasty old lady smell I had detected before. The reason why I have given this product 5 stars, is because I feel that this conditioner has been unfairly graded here. The conditioner is for people with curly or processed hair -- meaning, if you have straight, thick hair, this conditioner may seem like a waste of money due to the amount of product you have to apply. Also, as us girls with curly hair know, not all curly hair is equal. Some have thick, springy curls that gets curlier the shorter the cut it, while others have a thinner quality to their hair which actually gets curlier the longer it gets. I'm the later, and I think this is why this product works for me. I can understand how this may seem misleading to those with the thicker curl types, but I'm here to set the record straight on that one. I hope it helps in deciding if this product is right for you"

I wouldn't use it every day and don't recommend it unless you have dry hair that needs a bit of extra care. I have used American Cream but I think Coolaulin is better, at least for my hair.

I had to rummage through my box filled with Lush products ( gift from a thoughtful boyfriend) when I pulled out this huge disc and broke out half while saving the other for one more bath. I didn't even know what this was called but the minute it touched the water, refreshing and invigorating essences of lemons and milky cream escaped my nose, I felt happy in an instant, it was amazing! Even thought my nose refused to recognize scent for days I smelled the oils and citrusy botanicals, the bath water filled with tiny bubbles and I soaked my cold and stress away. 

After the bath I felt great, my skin and bones felt refreshed and I was warm, cozy and felt a lot better. After looking it up online I was really surprised to see that this was called The Happy Pill, because it really did make me happy. I am really looking forward to using the other half, hopefully when I'm not sick anymore. Once again Lush came through for me with the products they so lovingly create and I cannot recommend their bath bombs enough. Whether taken as a fun bath product or to relieve cold or sadness they always work in gentle and relaxing ways.

The main ingredients in this little love ball are good skin nourishers such as Olive oil, Hemp oil, Grapefruit oil, Bergamot oil, Frankincense oil, Lemon oil, Grange Flower Absolute, Mandarin oil, Gardenia Extract ( yum!) and sodium bicarbonate.

Happy Bathing!

This is a large foaming bath treat that looks like a big fizzy orange vitamin pill that you put in water. It seems to foam slowly and eventually I broke it into pieces to help the process along. It kept fizzing and foaming creating tiny orange and yellow islands within the bubbles (I added some bubble bath first - you might want to try some Happy Hippy shower gel). 

Eventually the water turned creamy (olive oil and hemp oil) and this bath reminded me of a creamsicle. Bergamot, orange flower and gardenia also make this a beautiful calming bath that leaves you in a good mood. 

This bath is fun with the Lemslip Buttercream. I keep applying some ""Whoosh"" temple balm to my wrists and happily inhaling deeply. This bath made me feel warm and snuggly and in the mood for lemon meringue pie or lemon sugar cookies or lemon tea. 

This is a good bath for the morning or evening, depending on your mood. I was drinking Celestial Seasonings Tension Tamer Extra with this LUSH experience. If you love ""Happy Hippy"" shower gel, this fun bath product will impress you.

Mistral, as I was happy to discover, is also the name of a line of bath and body products, all French inspired, all lusciously lovely from scented soaps to soothing lotions to rejuvenating body butters. 

Matthew Tilker, founder and president of Mistral, utilizes Shea butter, which is an efficacious natural healer, in a myriad of must-have forms. Derived from the nuts of the African Shea Tree (according to sacred custom the nuts are harvested primarily by women), this butter is highly emollient, a boon for those with dry skin, chapped lips, any number of skin irritations. 

The pure Shea Butter soap comes in a plethora of inviting fragrances, all milled six times (while others boast being triple milled). South Seas is a particular favorite - it's as fresh as an ocean breeze and as calming, soothing as a tropical island. The marine scent is accented with a touch of grapefruit, white flowers and soft woods. An irresistible combination. 

South Seas is a fragrance with which you wish to surround yourself - made possible by the shower gel, body lotion, massage bath and body oil, bath salts and candle all available at very accessible prices.

Suter,"Portland, OR","I have used Philosophy products for over a year now and am a proponent of their exfoliators and cleansers.  I enthusiastically bought The Present after seeing it as a new product at the Nordstrom counter.

The bottle says that it is clear makeup for fine lines, wrinkles, and uneven texture.  It can be used three different ways; alone as an oil-free moisturizer for sensitive skin; over oil free moisturizer (such as Hope in a Jar) to create the illusion of airbrushed skin; and under foundation for a smooth finish.

I was after that airbrushed skin, and this product works GREAT if used over moisturizer.  It truly does minimize pores and fine lines. If you don't like to wear a lot of makeup, it gives you a very fresh and natural look.  

Unfortunately, no matter how diligent your are, sometimes blemishes pop up and you have to use foundation.  The Present was not suitable in this function for me.  Used under my foundation, my makeup felt cakey, thick, and the foundation did not blend well into this product.  It left unsightly foundation streaks that were difficult to correct.  I could not hold my MAC foundation responsible, because used alone it does not exhibit any of these qualities.

I would highly reccomend this product as ""clear makeup"" but not as a foundation primer as indicated on the back of the bottle.  If you are looking for a foundation primer, I would reccomend Smashbox's Photo Finish.  It is extremely lightweight, blends well with foundation, and the bottle will last forever because you use such small amounts."

I'll often wear it on weekends without any additional makeup.  It smoothes this skin surface.  True - the coverage is not the same as with a tinted foundation - but it offers a lot of improvement worn alone.  Also, I was using a tinted cream makeup base that was not working well on my dry skin.  It would create lines, etc.  So I started combining the two things - the tinted cream base and the Philosophy skin perfector together on a sponge before applying and BINGO - This solved the problem.

I was told at the store that Fresh Farmacy would be the better bet for my kind of skin, and I figured the slightly higher pricetag on the FF meant that it was better than Coalface. Now, having used Coalface for the past week, I can say for sure that my skin feels cleaner and tighter with Coalface than it generally has with FF.

I'm not about to toss out my remaining FF of course! It lasts forever and I probably have another 6 or 7 months of it left. I find it to be a great skin cleanser. So far, though, I think Coalface is the better choice for me.

Give this stuff a try"

I recently received a Fusion razor and loved that, until I went to replace the blades.  $4+ a piece, and they last no longer than any other blade.  So, I got online and researched shaving and what I learned was that, though there have been advances in shaving technology, nothing has been improved, only made more expensive.  I learned my dad was right; all it takes for a great shave is a good safety razor, a decent brush, shaving soap and a mug.

I received my razor a couple of days ago and now, I wake up eager to take a shower and shave.  Nothing has ever cut this close without giving me razor burn.  My skin is sensitive and I have had no problems with that since getting this amazing razor.  It was worth the price, too, because it is the same cost as 4 sets of Fusion replacements.  The replacement blades for this razor are fifty cents a piece and do a far better job.  

I have read reviews for this razor by people who, apparently, weren't trained to shave.  This razor will not cut against the grain.  Also, the handle is weighted, so you have to allow the razor to do all the work, or you run the real risk of filleting your face.  Be patient.  A great shave takes a little more commitment than just breaking out a can of foam and a disposable razor.  Let the razor do the work.  I assure you, even if it takes a few days to get the technique down, you will be thrilled with this razor.

The nicest feature of this amazing razor is that it allows you to adjust the closeness of the blade. I learned that most people like it between one and one and a half.  Mine is set at one and a half and it gives me a perfect shave every time. Until now, I didn't know that such a thing was even possible.  Happy shaving"

Erickson,"Fresno, CA United States","The quality and workmanship is top notch! The price is high for a razor, but it will take you less than a year to break even if you are buying cartriges like the Gillette Fusion at $4 a pop! And it will last you a lifetime.  Replacement blades for the razor run about 50 cents each and last a hole lot longer! I was only getting 4-5 shaves from a Fusion blade, but I can shave my face and head for at least 2-3 weeks on a single safey razor blade :) Even if I changed the blade after every shave it would still cost less than a fusion. 

It takes some getting used to. I got a few minor nicks when I first started using it, but now I never get any.  I even shave my head with it :)  I've had mine for about 6 months and love it.

I suggest starting out on the #1 setting and work your way up. For me right between 1 and 2 is best, any higher and the shave is too close."

LUSH shampoos and conditioners are above a salon quality and also contain natural ingredients and scents that are beyond deluscious. This shampoo goes a long way so you can use a lot less. 

This shampoo contains seaweed, enzymes for cleaning and essential oils to detoxify your scalp. This product also contains a lovely helping of pineapple, kiwi and mango juice. The peppermint, rose, lavender, almond, rosemary, olive and jojoba oil are especially healing. If there is a more perfect shampoo, I haven't found it. This shampoo is a true dream and contains everything you want for deep cleansing and scalp refreshing.

For softly scented and highly conditioned locks, use this conditioning shampoo and finish off with the American Cream. The entire bathroom will be scented and the fragrance will drift through the house. You will awake the next morning and your hair will still be wonderfully scented with Egyptian musk, honey water, vanilla, sage and lavender.  The conditioner also contains fresh strawberries.

It's a squeezebottle with a brush at the end, and has a twist on lid.  No spills, no mess, no disaster.  Love it!

It is easy to apply with the brush.  I have Lava Flow, which is a shimmery pink.  The shimmer is a more obvious than I would like, as it's big flecks of sparkle, but it isn't so bad that it looks like glitter glue.  There is a strong smell and taste, sorta tropical; although it isn't unpleasant, it is powerful.  Kinda reminds me of red Koolaid.  The color is a bright pink when first applied, but simmers down to a medium pink and is rather sheer.  In the container the color looks unwearable, but in reality it isn't dramatic.  

The only drawback is how sticky it feels.  It is less sticky than Mac's Lipglass, but more so than Urban Decay XXX, if that makes sense.  

I got this as a freebie and I'm glad I got to try it.  I would buy it but in a different color"

It also fills in any lines you may have around the mouth so I recommend using it not only on your lips but also outside the lipline. Although I have been using it twice daily for many years, I believe someone using it for the first time should see results fairly quickly. 

Friends of mine who wear lipstick (I don't) also claim if they use it right before they put on lipstick it makes it go on better and last longer. 

(Apparently you can also use this product as an eye cream to smooth crowsfeet around the eyes, but I havent tried this- I prefer Caudelie eye serum and cream.)

Cousins,"seattle, wa","First of all, it seems a bit silly to defend the smell of any product, as everyone has different oppinions on this. I happen to love the smell, but I am writing this review to talk about what this product actually does; which is transforms hair. I have naturally curly hair, and awhile back I chopped it all off on a hairdresser's suggestion. When my hair was an inch long, it wasn't hard to fight my hair type. Now that I'm in the process of growing it out, my hair has been pretty annoyed at the contant blow drying, dying, and straightening I have subjected it to. Regardless of the cut, my hair has been limp and fried. After using this product along with Big shampoo, my hair has been absolutely transformed. People have commented on my hair ever since I have started using these wonderful products. Now to the issue of price: before using Lush, I was using bumble and bumble wich goes for 20 bucks a pop, as well as various styling products that ran in the similar price range... since using Lush, I have no need for styling products, therefore making these purchases very economical. I can't say enough great things about this brand"

It is a really thick conditioner and works great every other day or every few days. I have really long hair and this tames it and smoothes my split ends, and it leaves my hair shiny. It isn't greasy at all. 

If you are used to drugstore or salon conditioners, don't judge the effectiveness of any natural conditioner for a month. That is how long it can take for the silicones in mainstream conditioners to leave your hair (silicones are all those things in conditioner that end in ""cone"", like dimethicone, etc). Detoxing your hair off silicones is well worth it though, my hair is much healthier and shinier without that buildup.

So the scent: It is green, kind of melon and fresh, with a hint of violet (like Bathos, Gratuitous Violets, and Daddyo) to it. It took some getting used to, and when I first got it I thought it smelled of green beans or some vegetable-like smell. But when you use it and rinse it out, you are left with a rich green scent, with the tiniest hint of gently floral violet. 

It isn't for everybody, but if you buy it, give it a chance to work its magic in your hair before you make your judgement, because that lovely violetty smell combined with how well it works makes it kind of addictive. I use it with Daddyo shampoo to enhance that hint of violet and the fresh green scent I get from it. I use it in rotation with American Cream which is a bit lighter"

Paying 20 bucks for a conditioner did not quite suit me. However, I have been using it for a month now and I have to say that the reviews were an inadequate discription of the product. Personally, I believe this to be an amazing product. I used it in combination with Big and I believe my hair has never looked better. Retread is a superb conditioner and really does wonders. I have virgin hair, but I do blow dry it ever day so I felt a heavier conditioner was necessary. Since this is a deeper conditioner I would leave it in for 5-10 min or while you do all your other stuff in the shower/bath. My hair was softer than ever afterwards (that could be from Big though) and shined like the sun. This is not an everyday conditioner but works well for once or twice a week (I mainly use it for special occasions, or when I just want to feel pretty!) I highly recommend it and I feel that it works much better than Lush's conditioning treatments. The only issue was the smell. I am not much into the smell of cucumbers and to me that is what it smelled like. However, this could just be a personal attribute as no one else has mentioned this. The product was still amazing though, and I am willing to endure the smell(It fades as the day goes on). My decision about this product is Miracle! Hope this helps!"

My hair was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G after I used it.  After I've read all the reviews about the product, I was still a little skepticle, as I've tried many things that had awesome reviews, but just didn't work with my thick coarse hair.  

I shampooed my hair, put in Retread Hair Conditioner, covered my hair with a plastic cap and set a hot towel over it for an hour (dunking the towel in hot water every 15 minutes to 'reheat' it).  Rinsed out the conditioner and didn't use anything else on my hair (I usually have to put in anti-frizz serum).  

The first thing I noticed was the shine... what a HUGE difference.  Even my boyfriend said there was something different, but he couldn't quite figure it out.  Retread Hair Conditioner left my hair super soft too.  And you don't even need to use that much.

Now for the bad....

the smell (that's why it's not 5 stars)!  I know some people say they love it and some people say they hate it, and I really think that's the way it is... you either hate it or love it.  I actully hated it.  My boyfriend took one whiff (and thought it smelled like old soggy towels) and offered to drive me back to LUSH to return it because he thought it was 'old'.  Another reviewer said it smelled like 'barnyard' and I think that's the best way to describe it.  You do get used to it (and luckly the smell fades as your hair dries), but for me, the smell was too much.  

I will buy again because I absolutely love the results, but I will only use Retread Hair Conditioner when I know I will be home the next day to spare others from the smell"

It's a unique, almost indescribable blend of classicism, chic, and innocence. There's not a scent like it with top notes of fresh Mandarin, Bergamot, Lavender, and Apple Martini. Vibrant and warm it's a fragrance that caresses the senses. 

Middles notes are Patchouli, tender Paper Whites, and luxe Orchid. These are enhanced by bottom notes of irresistible white amber, sensuous cedar, and the very sultry musk. This is a scent I revel in, and enjoy wearing. 

The bottle is, of course, simple and exquisite, curved with polished glass, ultra feminine.

After just one to two uses, you start to notice a sense of calm and order descending upon your formerly sensitive skin. This is especially apparent if you layer the products, first using the cleanser, toner and then the essence and skin creams. If you have oily or combination skin, you may be amazed at how balanced your skin becomes. 

The Skin Essence contains Mulberry that naturally lightens discoloration from sun damage and aging. The antioxidants help to revitalize the skin. This is applied before the cream. Who knew when we were climbing around in mulberry trees staining our fingers and faces as children that one day we would use an extract in a lotion that would heal the skin and lighten our skin. 

Age spots and freckles literally start to disappear or may even slightly whiten more than the surrounding skin so they literally seem to fade away. I noticed this after just a few uses so it is super effective. 

Another reason to use this product is the ""super"" and I mean super fast healing properties. I was amazed. Put this on any skin irritation and watch it disappear in days. 

These products are so fun to use, I've incorporated them into a little night routine for my husband where I give him an antiaging facial before bed. I saw the results of the products on my skin and wanted to share this secret with him. His skin looked instantly more hydrated and he has dry skin. With my combination skin I've seen great results in balancing and clarity. 

The cleansers are like the champagne of skincare and the rest of the line is equally impressive. These are sort of out of my price range if I they didn't last so long and were not so effective. You only need such a small amount so in the end, it will be very economical and the results are superior to other products I've tried. The products also seem to encourage a natural exfoliation and deep cleansing, so you save money on all those other products you used to have to buy all the time. Plus, your skin will clear up and you can say goodbye to all those annoying costly solutions to a problem these products actually prevent. 

The entire line deserves 100 Stars! If you struggle to 
keep your skin clear, these products also provide
a new sense of confidence and are emotionally healing. 

Another surprising use for this product is on scars. Old
scars and new scars. They seem to just fade away. 

As Liv Tyler once said: ""I Swear Buy."" Well, she was talking about the shampoo. 

I say: ""Collect Them."" These products are essential and the best I've ever tried.

Pink Sugar makes me feel fabulous when I wear it; it's so light and `warm' with a base of sensual vanilla. I have the large bottle, body mousse & deodorent at home, and the smaller bottle in my handbag. I don't get bored with this fragrence, like I do with everything else I've tried over the years.

The first time I wore Pink Sugar to work one colleague commented on the aroma of drinking chocolate as I was in the lift with her. The next time I was in the lift, everyone commented on my lovely vanilla perfume. After I applied a freshen up spray, another colleague said she could smell cakes! Yet another colleague demanded to know what I was wearing, and where she could get some. Strangers come up to me in the street to ask what scent I'm wearing...

No this isn't a cheesy ad, it really happened!! 


What do I sense first? Liquorice, a rich aniseed scent that gradually settles into a middle note of caramel. Marshmallow is the first word that springs to mind to me.

Waterproof, smudgeproof, expensive, drugstore, you name it I've tried it.  Every single one left dark shadows under my eyes within 2 or 3 hours.  I'd given up on mascara completely, but thought I'd try one more time with this (with the money back guarantee from spalook, what's the risk?)

This mascara lives up to it's name as smudge-proof.  Even wearing sunscreen on my under-eye area, it doesn't transfer.  Even in 100+ deg Phoenix heat, it stays.  I *love* it for this reason.  It also comes off easily at night; no problems there.

However, I'm giving it only 4 stars because it does flake a little throughout the day.  Not a lot, and not enough to make me stop using it (the first truly smudge-proof mascara I've found), but it is there.  Since it's advertised as smudge and flake-proof, I can't give it the full 5 stars"

The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is, that even though they come in different colors, they all look more black than colored when dry. So the color doesn't stand out enough.

This product however, is pretty good.  It's a fairly good moisturiser that could honestly sell for less considering the cost of the product, but it does do the job it promises.

Provost,"Portland, OR United States","I have suffered from rosacia for the past nine years. As I was fairly young to be starting through a change of life, I had no idea what was causing my complexion problems. Not understanding (or expecting)what was happening to my skin, I made many many mistakes during the first year or so, trying to remedy the symptoms with countless products formulated more for adult acne or aging tired skin, bad idea. If you have rosacea or very sensitive skin, you know that sometimes it seems that all you need do is touch your skin the wrong way and you break out, let alone slathering some chemically based, perfumed, or exfoliating (ground pits and the like) product on your face. This becomes especially discouraging when you are also beginning to see the normal signs of aging but sensitivities won't allow you to take advantage of some of the great treatments out there to nourish your skin and stay a step ahead of the wrinkles, not to mention feeling starved for the moisture which is the real key to younger, healthy looking skin. After awhile I was afraid to try anything else, so I just stopped. I washed my face gently and left it at that. Well it only got worse and I felt like a dried up prune. Enter Philosophy hope in a jar for dry sensitive skin. It's as if this product was made just for me. Now instead of people asking me ""what's wrong with your face?"" they ask, ""what type of skincare do you use?"" Since I've been using The Philosophy skin care line, I find I guite often feel comfortable going out without makeup, something I had rarely done since my twenties. Since sun protection is so important, Philosophy offers a product called, When hope is not enough with spf 20 for daytime which comes in a bottle, but I have found that my skin responds much better to the Hope in a jar-dry sensitive formula, then followed by Philosophy's seperate sunsreen called Shelter-spf 15. This is because ""Shelter"" does not contain vitamin C or peptides and has a slightly lower concentration of sunscreens, contrary to the spf-20 moisurizer combo. You may be able to get by with the combination product and save a few bucks, but the aforementioned ingredients in it do not agree with my sensitivities, especially the vitamin C. As for the much needed exfoliation dilemma, try philosophy's, Micro-delivery peel pads or their ""Peel kit"" both are soothing and non-abrasive. Hope this helps and enjoy your new skin!"

The predominent note is a sparkling anise, an anise that affects a cold, even metallic, chemic artifice. Swirling about this shivery base note are hints of moss, violet, and vanilla-like tonka, lending an aura of both forest and fantasy. 

Though this is a relatively popular scent, Lolita eschews convention. There are no white flowers, no rose, no peach, none of the banal and cloying sweetness that plagues so many scents. This perfume is instead sensual yet apart, not at all come-hither but insinuating and dark as a Grimm's tale. The tonka is sweet and powdery, gently seductive, while the more prominent anise intoxicates.

I think they could add double the rose oil, but you can add in rose and ylang ylang if you are in the mood. The Tisty Tosty heart-shaped bath bomb is perfect if you enjoy blending your own essential oils or prefer a mild/calming bathing experience. 

I'd suggest using this one for skin calming and also adding in a ""Romance In a Stone,"" ""Sex Bomb"" or ""Chelsea Garden"" bath bomb to add a little more romance to the bath. 

I did feel emotionally calm (rose balances the emotions) and my skin loved this bath bomb, but it was not as sensory as I'd hoped. Following this bath with the ""It's A Pleasure Treasure Massage Bar"" is fun, also heart-shaped. 

You may want to try the ""Violet"" soap with this bathing experience. The next time I try this, I might mix it with an ""Elixir"" bath melt and a bit of the ""Bathos"" bubble bar, also scented with violet. 

As far as this being a magic spell, you just never know who might call you when you use this bath. Probably right when you are in the bath. So, if you think this will work instantly, you might want to keep the phone by the tub. It was funny, but when I was in the bath, my husband was trying to call me and said he let the phone ring and ring. Did he really think I would leave the pleasure of a Lush bath to answer the phone? 

Personally, I think they should scent this bath bomb like the It's a Pleasure Treasure Massage Bar. It is blissfully delicious and almost seems edible - looks like white chocolate (it is mostly cocoa butter) and has a heady scent of orange blossom honey and neroli.

I always keep some in my linen closet as it gives a faint wonderful scent to all the sheets and pillowcases.

Try all of the bath bombs. I use the Tisty Tosty whenever I need an evening of self indulgence. Put the water on and watch the heart-shaped bomb fizzle and send hundreds of rose petals floating to the top of the tub.
Put some fluffy bath towels to warm on a rail.
Place some Dr Haushka's oil to heat by a radiator.
Pour a glass of champagne.
Surround the tub with lots of  tea lights.
Put on some Rahman music.
Get in and imagine a private Ganges.
When you get out its very eassy to scoop up the petals- take the pre-warmed towels and wrap yourself in one.

 By then the oils will be warm and pour in palm of hand and rub on body. 
I also like to put some  bath bombs in guest bedrooms with the towels- 
If you haven't tried the Karma soap do try it ......alone or with someone special.."

I was looking for a shadow that could be good for daytime and also nighttime. I took home the rose gold and it was really really beautiful on.

While the cream is kindof expensive-- when you think about avoiding stretchmarks, no price is too high. I used about 4 tubes for the duration.  I expected to get stretchmarks because my mom had them with me, so I was happy to get anything less than hers.  Anyway, I didn't get any at all on my stomach until the last two weeks (my baby was 8lbs. 8oz.) and they are really small.  I put the cream on my breasts and abdomen every day after a shower, but because it was expensive I skipped my sides (love handle area) and did get stretchmarks there which were darker than the ones on my stomach. Since my stomach has gone down, the ones on my stomach are very light and will probably go away enough to satisfy my ego.  I highly recommend giving the Mustela cream a chance"

Come June & sunny, hot & bright days, I found myself trying `Just Me' in the shops & buying a bottle (which I'm quickly making my way through).

Lighter & easier to wear then `Paris Hilton', I'm using it all the time. Scent wise; the strongest note for me is the pink peppercorn - sharp & tangy. It contrasts nicely with the floral notes, so neither individual note overpowers me.

Overall `Just Me' can be worn anywhere during the day; work, shopping or lunch.

I was super excited to try this because I've been told by numerous people that philosophy's products are spectacular. First, I must point out that there are sparkles in this lip gloss. Although they're very subtle on your lips, if you're the type of gal who hates sparkles and shimmer in your makeup, I'd stay away from this product. As for smell, it DOES smell like cinnamon buns. It certainly does not TASTE like it however (which is a good thing... I tend to lick off my lip gloss if it tastes good... this lip gloss does not taste good). It's very sticky and thick so you don't have to use too much. It also stays on your lips for a good amount of time. Would I suggest this product? If you're looking for a good-smelling, long lasting lip gloss, I'd definitely recommend this. However, if these two things don't matter to you I'd suggest you skip this ($10 for a tube of lip gloss isn't cheap after all) and go for a drugstore brand lip gloss"

One of those is Hypnose and I really like it for when I go out or just looking for that dramatic look.

Postive:
1.) The look: I've never neccessarily wanted to wear fake eyelashes but they do look almost perfect. Unbelievably, Hypnose gives you that look. It's amazing just how feathery your eyelashes look.
2.) Flaking: This mascara never really flaked on the bottom of my eyes. That's really important to me.

Negative:
1.) This mascara starts out great but after about two and a half weeks it starts emptying out on you. This might just be because there were days when I reapplyed it or simply because I just used it pretty well (1 coat just about everyday because of how much I liked it).

Summary: If you want that natural yet ""are those real lashes?!"" look, then you'll like this mascara. I'm giving it four stars instead of five simply because of how long it lasts but if you use it once it a while, then it will last you a while"

Just one word of warning -- you can't really go by the color samples. It's better to see them in person. I bought Lilac Mist which is beautiful on the brow bone and was very close to what I was expecting. But Paris By Night looks like a gray but is actually a deep mauve.

The peach note in some fragrances also turns funky on my skin, but I have not had this problem with Eau de Recolte Bleue.  I prefer this over their Lavender Harvest fragrance, which I think would smell better on men (JMOP.)

Here is a description from their website:

""Eau de la RÃ©colte Bleue exudes all the pleasures of Provence. Both fresh and as light as air, it captures the celebratory feel of the Lavender Harvest.

Composed from a blend of the green scent of leaves and A.O.C. Lavender essential oil, Eau de la RÃ©colte Bleue is accompanied by the delicate notes of freesia, marigold and frosted peach. Woody and musky aromas then leave a lingering and sensual, fragrant trail.""

First, I have to say that the texture is intriguing.  It's a balm, but it feels much more velvety, and the slight shimmer gives you a sheen.

Second, I am a sucker for the packaging and presentation.  It comes in a little tin box, with the signature Bathina (very retro chic) and a black powder puff that has a pink ribbon holder.  It makes you want to apply the product in public, just to have an excuse to show off the set.  Also, it ups the feminity factor of applying a product with the little puff (very ""I adore being a girl..."")

Then, there's the scent.  It's a floral, sexy fragrance that doesn't overpower.  It's clean and a big plus is that it doesn't make me sneeze, like some other scents.

I think that a little goes a long way, and thus, I can say that even though it's a ""boutique-brand"" product, it is very affordable.  I think that as warmer weather sets in, and you want to show off a little more skin, this is a product that would enhance a tan."

If you can find someone to give you a head massage with this product, then you can truly relax. If applying this yourself, it works well as an at home hair treatment to nourish the hair follicles and promote healthy hair growth. You will also notice your hair becoming stronger and retaining a much deeper shine. The essential oils in this product help to activate micro-circulation which may cause a slight tingling and warming of the scalp. Leave this in for about 5-10 minutes and then wash your hair as normal. You may find you need less conditioner when using this product. Many hairdressers will use this product when giving a conditioning head massage and that is where I first found out about this product. I bought my first bottle the day I had the massage. I was that impressed and I keep buying this product.

This solid shampoo bar works wonderfully; I had my doubts just like everyone else, and was worried that this would remove the build up but leave the hair overly squeaky clean and stripped, and if it would later at all. To my surprise this small disc turns into an avalanche of bubbles once I wet it and rub it between the hands. I also wet my hair and rub the bar all over, working with the lather form my hands and the lather from the wet bar. I have to admit that this produces more lather than liquid shampoos and washes the hair without leaving it feeling like it was tortured, instead its slippery and wonderfully light. Afterwards I follow with the American Cream conditioner (probably the best hair scented product in the universe) also from Lush for a head of hair that feels rich and buttery soft, with a fresh light fragrance that lingers on.

The scent itself is wonderful, citrusy and earthy, with Patchouli Oil, Orange Oil, Lavendin Oil, Pine Oil , Lemongrass Oil , Elemi Oil , Gardenia Extract and the Roman Chamomile Flower. I often find that all the oils and rich botanicals nourish the hair and leave it feeling happy, organic and natural products have been of high interest to me lately because of the results they deliver for bouncy hair and supple skin. After using drugstore and even expansive brands of hair products and skin potions, I find that my skin and hair never really benefited from all those preservatives and unnatural products derived from mineral oils and god knows what else. Lush and Burt's Bees, Jason and The Body Shop made me change my mind and seek out products that are as good as they smell, and that truly transform me from a sleepy duckling in the morning to a happy princess by the time my morning routine is over.

The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. 

Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact.

There' not a crunch factor either although if you keep spraying it on dry brushed out hair the hair can tend to get dryed out. It does add spring and holds well.

i'm one of those unfortunate few who for some reason or the other always end up with ""panda eyes"" at the end of the day due to mascara run-off. i've tried everything from cheap to expensive, and from regular to waterproof mascaras to no avail. somehow though, this mascara, because of the unique properties of the fibers will not smudge on the skin, no matter how humid or wet the day is. the cool thing about it is that if you rub your eyes the fiber will fall, but not stain the skin, thus eliminating the panda eye effect. the fibers will coat the eyelashes and dry up, forming a sort of tube around the lashes and are surprisingly easy to clean at the end of the day, no special solutions needed. when you clean your eyelashes you can actually see the fibers loosen up and leave your lashes without any residue.

i am also a contact lens wearer and this product, unlike many other mascaras, doesn't irritate my eyes and lasts practically forever.

this has to be the best mascara i have used yet, and that is saying something. even the expensive department store and specialty mascaras pale next to this. and i even bought it at a local japanese drugstore!

never leave home without it; it's possibly the last mascara you'll ever need"

I've been using Merkur blades for almost 25 years, and for overall quality and value, I'd say they're the best around. I've found them best when teamed with the Merkur ""Progress"" adjustable razor.

This product has actual coconut oil which I also use on it's own, my boss who is a gorgeous Indian woman gets me coconut oil from her local supermarket and she told me to heat it up in the microwave for 15 seconds and then apply to dry hair, massaging into the scalp and letting it sit as long as I can before shampooing out twice to find my hair shiny and luxuriously full of volume and softness. The same oil is really amazing on the skin, not only does it smell like coconut milk with powdered milk mixed together but is wonderful on dry winter days when my skin wants to turn red and be irritated.

Fabulously creamy and comforting this indulgent cream settles me in for a cozy and warm night, because there's nothing better than a warm shower with a great product that makes me want to jump into a clean, fuzzy bed and dream of sweet things.

My only complaint is that it only lasted about a week for me. I have medium-long hair, and didn't use that much. I haven't tried my other shampoo bar yet, so I don't know if that's more of a problem just for this particular bar, or if it's a problem across the board. Read the reviews and find out!"

Cynthia Sylvia Stout is a much more pleasant experience with beer blended with fresh lemon juice, cognac oil and lemon oil. It looks a little like a chocolate syrup and I didn't think it had a very strong beer scent. 

Strangely enough, the scent sort of reminds me of freshly made whole wheat yeast dough (perhaps with a hint of lemon zest), which is currently baking in my bread baker. This is a very cleansing shampoo that you might want to use when your hair is misbehaving and needs a little shine and control. You may only need to shampoo once since this really cleans well the first time. 

Using this with the Veganese conditioner will leave your hair feeling super clean and not overly conditioned. If you want a deeper conditioning experience, try American Cream conditioner which is simply intoxicating. Please don't make me live without it! 

While I enjoyed using Cynthia Sylvia Stout shampoo, I still think my first love is Rehab shampoo (the scent of Rehab is divine). This shampoo did make my hair feel silky and soft so I'll definitely buy it again.

It does smell VERY strongly of beer when you use it, so if you have an aversion to that smell, you won't like this.  At first I didn't like the smell, but now I think it's sort of a nice ""wake up.""  I don't smell it on my hair when it's dry as other reviewers have noticed - although I use (non-Lush) conditioner afterwards, so maybe that tends to wash the smell away?

This shampoo makes my hair SO shiny.  I have long blonde hair, and it really makes it glow like nothing else.  I don't know how it does it...but people will literally come up to me and comment on how nice and shiny my hair looks on the days I use this product!  

Oh, and this shampoo is very concentrated - a little goes a long way.  So, think of it as though you're getting twice as much when factoring the price in.  It's still expensive, but I think it's a great product when you need a little splurge"

Gardening is one of my hobbies, and I love to be out of doors. I know, I know - wear garden gloves. For me, digging in the dirt isn't enjoyable in gloved hands. Hence, sun spots.

Over a period of weeks Cellex-C Fade Away Gel has markedly faded the most obvious spots. It isn't oily so I apply the gel to the sun spots twice a day, in the morning and at night. 

By remembering to apply sunscreen to my hands before going outside I think I'll be able to maintain the beneficial effects of this gel.

The cream comes in a slick white tube with a gold and orange stripe at the top and can be squeezed out like toothpaste as the thick metal tube lets me get to the very last bit at the end, a total bonus since I hate wasting product.

Expensive, but well  worth it since Dr. Hauschka products are extremely natural and healing in their properties with no harsh chemicals disguised by pink dyes and fragrances. This cream smells like a pale pink Bulgarian rose garden, something I got to experience as a child as it makes me smile twenty years later as I used this cream. Winter and high times of stress or freaky dry skin episodes are the usual scenarios that would require me to use this cream as I usually stick to my favorite green tube of Cetaphil lotion as my day and night moisturizer ever since I got it from my dermatologist who did wonders to my complexion two years ago.

Great as a face cream and also wonderful as eye cream, especially when the computer I use at work always seems to suck any moisture form my eye area right out. This patted right on top of makeup refreshes and plumps up the skin, and only a tiny bit is needed. This cream lasts for months so at this price it's really a bargain considering that what I put on my face always shows up as results or neglect if the wrong product is use.

First off, the price might be a detrement to those who are used to $3/can drug store shaving cream, but a little goes a long way, and this little bottle might actually last you longer than 4 or 5 cans of cream or gel. You only use a small amount each day, and it spreads evenly over your whole face. When used in tandem with a good shaving cream, it virtually eliminates razor burn and uncomfortable shaving. My razor glides over my face each morning now. If you look at your razor each morning with disgust like I used to, give this stuff a shot. I guarantee you won't be disappointed.

Yes, it stings a bit when I put it on, but it quickly goes away.
It doesn't dry my skin out, it actually helps get rid of the dry, white-looking flaky skin after I shave.

I used to get ingrown hairs so bad on my face that they would be there for MONTHS. Eventually I'd get to the point of having to do my own surgery with a needle to try and extract the hair.

If I get an ingrown hair now, I just use Tend Skin once in the morning and once before bed, and it actually extracts the hair on it's own! It gets rid of the redness and swelling also associated with ingrown hairs.
For the only time in my life my face actually looks clear, and Tend Skin is the product that has done it for me.

Before I finish, I'd just like to add that I'm the kind of person that NOTHING ever works on. Any product I try, never does as advertised. Whether it be shampoo, deodorant, medication, etc.
Tend Skin is one of the rarities that actually DOES work for me.
And believe me, I've tried a LOT of products for ingrown hairs"

Cold cream and soft cloth tissues.  A gentle misting of water and then another dabbing with cloth.  Then night cream, eye cream (""dab on gently, never rub""), a special lotion for her throat and collarbone area.  She would impart her beauty secrets to me while I sat transfixed.  Although I was convinced that she was the most beautiful woman in the world, I was surprised that with all these lotions and oils, she didn't' slide right out of bed at night.  ""Exercise, Sweetheart.  Drink lots of water.  Never go to sleep in your makeup--no matter how tired you are.  Never wash your face with regular soap.  Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize.  Your skin has to last you a lifetime and nothing gives away a woman's age like uncared for skin.""  While I am not sure where I would even find 'cold cream' today, I follow the vast majority of her regimen.  The two items that I use for under my eyes are Avon's Repair Eye Serum and Hydrofirming Bio6 Eye Cream.  The cream plumps up and firms the delicate tissue around the eye, and the serum smoothes and moisturizes the skin.

I consider Avon products to be the unsung work horses of the beauty industry.  They almost always do exactly what they say they are going to do and at a very modest price.   Expensive boutique and department store products rarely do a better job and are usually exorbitantly overpriced.   When you factor in that Avon products go on sale regularly (which is when I usually stock up), you are getting an even better deal for your money.  While I am not a complete cheapskate, I love a bargain and I want to feel like I am getting full value for my money.

The skin around the eyes is quite thin and delicate, so I think if you follow my Mother's advice and ""dab on gently, never rub"" Avon's Repair Eye Serum and Hydrofirming Bio6 Eye Cream you will be able to keep this area smooth, without being greasy, even with the most drying of climatic conditions"

Contrary to what someone else here said, I find that it does absorb very quickly.  I buy it because it is NOT oily--oily makeup around my eyes makes my eyes burn, and this gives me no problems at all.  Also, I have sensitive skin so I have to use hypoallergenic makeup.

I have terrible circulation.  I get cold and stay that way.  From time to time I'm also an insomniac.  The Wiccy Massage Bar has a cure for both.  The cinnamon leaf is very warming on the skin and the Aduki beans seem to help this warmth penetrate. (They also fall all over the floor if you're not careful...but you wont care..the bar is THAT good). The oil is thick and lovely - but be careful about rubbing up against anything it may stain.  This is one of the reasons I only ever use it before bedtime.  Who cares if it messes up the Cartman Flannel Pajama bottoms?  

Speaking of bedtime...I'm not sure what it is..whether it's the cinnamon or the other essential oils I can't name, but they have a very calming effect.  Much better than yucky smelling lavender.  Helps me get to sleep in no time flat.

You were me. Looking for what seemed to be a simple thing - a scented candle that ACTUALLY smells up the room when you light it. You've bought the cheap ones in the grocery store that sent out the weak scent of, well, grocery store. And some candles smell like spray room deodorizer which smells like what one would use in the toilet which then make you think of poop which is not at all what you were going for in the living room. So then you hit the expensive pretty versions - perhaps even in candle stores with cute waxy names. They are not candles, my friend. They are sculptures. Some fancy ones come with cute packaging and crispy dried flowers. This is when you lose your patience. I DO NOT WANT CRISPY DRIED FLOWERS. I WANT A CANDLE THAT PUMPS A GOOD SCENT ALL OVER A ROOM WHEN I LIGHT IT.

This is it. Votivo. You will walk into the room and that room will smell like the candle. The most universally loved scent is probably Red Currant. I also enjoy Rain. The little glass it comes in makes a cute vase after the candle is done. Plus, they make perfect last minute hostess gifts, as the box is very nice and expensive-looking.

So, Votivo isn't the cheapest candle in the world. They're still cheaper than buying a bunch of cheap candles that stink...weakly stink."

Just a simple gylcerine-based soap with a dark orange-red hue, but the smell is just so wonderful that every time I wash my hands it turns into some sort of new-age deep-breathing exercise while I try to get as much of that lovely scent into my nostrils as I can.

I've found that this soap lathers better than others, but you have to be careful not to leave it in the shower all the time, or it will get soft and melt away with the condensation. Trust me, you don't want to waste any of this stuff by letting it leak into the drain while other people are using the bathroom! I leave mine out so it can make my bathroom smell really great as an added bonus :)

Fresh, fruity, citrusy, with just a tiny hint of patchouli to give it an earthy note. Definitely a winner from Lush! As soon as I smelled this soap in their store for the first time, I loved this scent. As you can tell from the reviews, a lot of other people do, too"

The deep purple color is remnicent of crushed blackberries and the scent is a mingling of lemon, coconut, Bergamot and violets. The truth is, this shampoo is one of the best shampoos Lush sells and I think it gives even more body and texture than Rehab. Use this and follow with the Coolaulin conditioner for shiny bouncy hair that is scented with violets and coconut. 

The fragrance follows you around for hours and envelops you in a comforting warmth. This shampoo may have you dreaming about the Purple Haze gift box filled with violet, lavender and blackcurrant items or looking into the ""Gratuitous Violets"" soap. 

To complete the experience, you may want the ""Smitten"" hand cream - quite luxurious and comforting. For some reason, the All That Jas bath item worked well with the violet scent so my house is now scented with Jasmine and Violets and I feel like I'm walking in fields of flowers.

I really only went to pick up a free moisturizer as I've found with some judicious sampling you don't have to pay for that item. Instead, I fell in love with this soap (and got free moisturizer too-hooray!!)

When the sales rep first handed me the bar soap, I balked. I've known people who've used Clinique but just the idea of washing my face with BAR soap freaked me out. They do offer a liquid version but the rep told me the soap was a better exfoliant. I can't say for sure if that's so but I can say this really is a great face wash. I was addicted after one use. And since it is a bar of soap, you'll get a really great sudsy foam. It has a mild, pleasant scent and it washes off easily. I have the mild version and I just love it. My skin feels clean but never tight and not only does it not cause breakouts, it immediately calmed the one I had. I'll definitely be buying more. 

I do want to add, however, it is drying in the wintertime if you have normal skin and I had to switch to a cream cleanser. It may not be a problem for oily skin. For dry skin, I'd really avoid it in the winter at least.

You still ideally need a makeup remover before the soap. I also became a recent convert to Clinique's Rinse Off Foaming Cleanser. But even if you don't want to use that product, remember that removing your makeup is a separate step."

After just one to two uses, you start to notice a sense of calm and order descending upon your formerly sensitive skin. Weeks later you look at your skin and it seems like you are at least ten years younger. The smoothness, clarity and youthful glow truly shows with continued use. 

If you have oily or combination skin, you may be amazed at how balanced your skin is and how you no longer experience the shine breakthrough in your makeup due to the initially drying aspects of other cleansers. 

The Komenuka Bijin Facial Cleansing Foam is very economical and an eighth of a teaspoon is enough for a wonderful face cleansing experience. The ingredients include: Rice Germ Oil, Rice Bran, Coconut Oil, Seaweed, Aloe Algae, Ginkgo Biloba, Matricaria, Yeast, Perilla Ocymoides, Honey, Lithospermum and Fountain Water.

The Moisture Cream goes a long way. The main oils are Rice Germ Oil, Jojoba Oil and Olive Oil. Vitamin E, Rice Bran and Aloe make this a skin-healing treat.

Other products to fall in love with: 

Cleansing Powder - Packets of deep cleansing grains turn silky and creamy when you add water. 

Makeup Remover - A fragrance-free cream that removes makeup and mascara. Based on olive oil. 

UV Cream - Slightly tinted and waterproof, this sunblock also seems to even out skin tone. Could be used as a makeup base if you are looking for a more natural look. 

Hair Shampoo & Conditioner - Thickens fine hair instantly. Removes buildup and leaves your hair feeling luxurious. 

Essence - This is a product that is magical. It can be used for skin healing and it also lightens freckles and age spots.

	With earth minerals for a lovely luster and shine, the color is applied directly to the skin with fingertips or brush.  It blends smoothly and leaves a soft, velvety texture.

	There's no limit to where it can be used - as a blush on the apple of the cheeks or across forehead, brow bone or chin for a ""just in from a day at the beach"" look.  For evening my preference is the Honey Glow applied across shoulders as well.

B000A0QQRQ:all-around_best_razor:joseph_dipietro,B000A0QQRQ,Merkur Progress Double Edge Safety Razor: Beauty,beauty,2 of 2,5.0,All-around best razor,"December 21, 2006",Joseph Dipietro,"Philadelphia, PA","Having shaved with everything from cheapo disposables to Thiers-Issard straight razors, I have to say that the Merkur Progress is probably the best all-around razor available today. It has excellent heft and balance, and the adjustment feature is simple and straightforward. (Although I do agree that the numbered adjustment seems to perform a little differently depending on the blade used.) It is easy to keep clean--assuming you don't mind unscrewing it and taking the blade out to wipe off the head and frame. Having also used a venerable old Gillette ""fat boy"" from the 1950s, I'd still have to rate the Progress as a better razor; the screw operated adjustment makes it constantly adjustable, not just in steps. 

Since this is a safety razor, its performance is significantly dependent on the blades used. I've tried both the Merkur blades and the Japanese ""Feather"" blades, and would say that it's a toss-up. 

And since it is an adjustable safety razor, it is perfectly suited to two-pass close shaving. A higher setting is excellent on the first pass with the grain of the beard, and a lower setting for the pass against the grain. The adjustment also allows you to adjust the razor to the conditions of your skin and beard. If you've let yourself get a day's worth of stubble (c'mon--don't we all?) you can set the blade high to mow that hedge. If you need a quick clean-up before a night on the town, you can set it lower for a ""Once lightly, James.""

So if you want a really well-made, no-nonsense but very versatile razor that will last for a good long time, this is a good bet. The only problem might be preventing pals from swiping it, or reminding your wife/significant other to take it apart to clean it after she smooths up those pretty pins you love so well.

One recommendation: Shop around. You can get these for under $40.00 if you bargain-hunt, likewise full 20-count boxes of carded Merkur 10-blade refill sets"

The textures are good.  The scrub side is slightly grainy, more of a polish than a scrub.  I would not recommend it for heavily chapped lips, but it works well for weekly maintenance. The lip balm side is a little waxy, but moisturizing with vityamin e.  It's quite long-lasting and provides a sweet, natural shine.  This smells of spun vanilla, sweet and sugary.

The scrub part of the stick does a great job, but you need to have lips that aren't in dire need of help for it to really work.  To do that, just use a moist, soft toothbrush, and gently scrub.  The scrub side will sometimes leave a little sugar behind, so you might have to wipe your lips off a little after you use it, but I found that this doesn't happen all the time.

The balm side goes on smoothly, and feels great.  It's silky feeling, but does not provide a lot of moisture, so, if you lips are on the dryer side,  this is not going to replace your regular gloss.

The ""green luster"" makes this bath especially beautiful and gives it a mermaid mood. I loved this one so much, I'm ordering two the next time. 

The scent is lemon/lime, but by the time you get in the tub, the floral scents are more prominent. You can add in some bubbles, but they don't seem to last very long - well, I was using a bath gel. 

So, you may want to find a bubble bar because the olive oil seems to make them disappear pretty fast. At least, that is my theory because I've noticed bath oil does the same thing. Avobath goes well with Whoosh products or the Happy Hippy Shower gel. If you are in the mood, you might want the amazing ""Godiva"" shampoo and conditioner 2 in 1 bar (has a magical quality - makes hair super shiny) or the ""I love Juicy"" shampoo and ""Veganese"" conditioner. The last two also have a citrus scent and are especially delicious.

Since lemongrass oil is good for uplifting the spirits, this is a great bomb for those tired or grumpy days we all have sometimes.

There is the mildest shimmer to it, that you really have to look for in the water itself, and it gives the lime-green water a lovely depth and sparkle. But it isn't glittery and you won't end up with anything you can see on your skin. It is more an in-bath pony trick!

Tom ""Mediahound""","SF Bay Area, CA United States","While most sunscreens these days protect against sunburn, did you know that very few of them actually protect against photodamage? Only two sunscreen ingredients protect against the long UVAI rays that cause photodamage (brown spots, wrinkles, etc); zinc oxide and Parsol 1789. Zinc Oxide protects a broader range of these rays than does Parsol 1789. 

This Skinceuticals sunscreen has zinc oxide and it goes on without any white film or greasiness-perfect for daily use on the face. While Neutrogena Dry Touch suncreens feel more invisible on the skin (you can't even tell it is on except for the smell) and is a good alternative (has Parsol 1789), I still prefer the Skinceuticals for the added protection and virtually no scent whatsoever. Since it's expensive, I tend to use it just on the face and use a cheaper (like Neutrogena) sunscreen on the body when out in the sun."

It seems I am one of those people forever stuck in a time warp and prefer this classic instead of trying new scents. While I prefer the eau de parfum spray I have both variations. Although at first this tends to have a strong aroma, this doesn't last after being applied to your skin. I love the blend of vanilla, mandarin orange, peach and lemon that make up the scent of ObsessionÂ®.

My preference is more of a racy, provocative, alluring scent instead of brimming like flowers. With my skin irritations, asthma and allergies I have no problems with spraying my body parts with ObsessionÂ®. The color is quite appealing, reminding me of Spiced Rum with the brown, amber and gold tones. ObsessionÂ® cologne is suitable for both day and evening wear, indoors and outdoors and those luscious intimate settings. 

This is definitely a feminine scent, sweet, sexy and not too fruity or powerful.   There is a gold toned rim with the cap snapping on and pulling off most of the time with ease. Sometimes the lid does not go on just right and then the cap part becomes undone and this makes two pieces.

Once the scent has set in for awhile on my skin I detect a hint of floral with wood combination and have read on fragrance.net that ObsessionÂ® has oriental spices. It really is a winning combination that has captured my interest over the years. This is a scent that is recognizable by men and women and can be worn through out the seasons. 

I would not say this is a musk scent but more of a spicy tingle that needs to be only administered once a day for long lasting appeal. The appeal of ObsessionÂ® seems to run from girls in their early twenties to those of us in our early forties, from conservative ladies to party animals. 
 
Although it is a darker color than most fragrances, there is no staining on clothing, but I do not wear sweaters, whites or turtlenecks. When I do use the glass jar I have noticed frequently when standing over the sink the yellowish/brown tint left in the sink and have to rinse it off as well as my finger tips. 

ObsessionÂ® is a potent and romantic perfume for evening. The prices of the assorted sizes of ObsessionÂ® range from forty to sixty dollars. "

Mistral, as I was happy to discover,  is also the name of a line of bath and body products, all French inspired, all lusciously lovely from scented soaps to soothing lotions to rejuvenating body butters.

	Matthew Tilker, founder and president of Mistral,  utilizes Shea butter, which is an efficacious natural healer, in a myriad of must-have forms.  Derived  from the nuts of the African Shea Tree (according to sacred custom the nuts are  harvested primarily by women), this butter  is  highly emollient,  a boon for those with dry skin, chapped lips, any number of skin irritations.

	The pure Shea Butter soap comes in a plethora of inviting fragrances, all milled six times (while others boast being  triple milled).  South Seas is a particular favorite - it's as fresh as an ocean breeze and as calming, soothing as a tropical island.  The marine scent is accented with a touch of grapefruit, white flowers and soft woods.  An irresistible combination.

	South Seas is a fragrance with which you wish to surround yourself - made possible by the shower gel, body lotion, massage bath and body oil, bath salts and candle all available at very accessible prices.

	Highly recommended"

The brush is easy to guide and you do not end up with big thick, clumpy patches especially when the mascara is new. It parts and separates the lashes perfectly. For night I apply 2 coats for a more dramatic look. It never smudges and is easy to remove (I use Clinique 'naturally gentle eye make-up remover'). And yes, it may be a little expensive but it lasts for ages (doesn't dry out like other mascaras)and the quality of the product surpasses anything else.

I thought, ""Hmmm...Handsome looking vintage piece, but there's no way in hell I'm gonna put that meat cleaver to my face!"" Well guilt got the best of me, I figured the razor looked expensive so I'll give it a go and hope that if I die from blood loss the police will figure out that my death was from shaving with a new razor and it's not from suicide. I'll tell you after a few times shaving with this razor I am now going to retire My Gillette Fuzion. It's takes a bit longer to shave with this razor than with a conventional multi-blade but the results are undeniably better. My wife can't wait to kiss my cheek with school girl glee right after I shave! I have a beard that is as tough as sandpaper and I've never had a closer shave than with this Merkur. I don't have the same spots to go over and over again and therefore my face is less irritated. I use a brush, a glycerin based shave cream and always shave in the shower and that makes a significant difference as well. Factor in that blades for this razor costs so much less then Mach 3 & Fuzion's (I buy cryogenically tempered blades that last 2x longer than store bought) and the way to opt out from expensive razor marketing ploys becomes clear. Don't sit on the fence on this one ditch whatever Mach, to the nth power, razor you're using and pick this Merkur ASAP"

This gives me hardly any nicks compared to the Gillette Mach 3 and is way easier to unclog than the Shick Quattro. 

The sample blade continues to last with about 2 shaves a week since Dec. 2006. Typical razor cartridges wouldn't even come close to that longevity, and they cost about 4 times as much as the replacement Merkur blades, which are 50 cents each.

I am just doing facial shaving with it at this point; hopefully it will fare just as well with head shaving. I expect I'll be using Merkur for the rest of my life"

I may eventually decide to upgrade, but if I ever do, it will only be after much practice with this razor and simply for the sake of having the adjustment feature, which may or may not be necessary for some individuals depending on the toughness and thickness of your beard.  When used in conjunction with a badger hair shaving brush, some excellent shaving cream (Proraso was my first, and the only thing mildly unpleasant is the scent, and even that grows on you after a while...check your local Target near the women's spa section) and the highest quality DE razor blade, changed every so often, of course, this razor provides an excellent, close, irritation-free shave.  After using this marvel, I vow never to return to the cheaply made, ridiculously expensive (when the cost of replacement cartridges is considered over the course of a man's shaving lifetime) multi-blade systems of Gillette or Schick.  Just be a little more careful of your technique, and getting an outstanding shave from this razor should be a cinch.  Highly recommended"

The lemon oil in two of the Lush products work together especially well. Veganese Conditioner and I Love Juicy shampoo could not be a better solution if you need to deep clean your hair. Like after you have put too much hairspray in your hair or you went swimming or say you fell in a mud puddle (In that case, also reach for Happy Hippy body wash). 

You just never know what may occur and one must always be prepared. The Veganese is also a lovely vegetarian product that can be enjoyed by anyone. It has a very clean, happy energy and a lemony scent. The slippery conditioner slicks across your hair, making it shiny and manageable without weighing it down.

This also contains rosemary infusion, lavender flower infusion, seaweed and fresh lemon juice. Will be appreciated by anyone trying to lighten their hair. 

If you use the henna products by Lush, these two products might slightly lighten your henna results. This could be desired or you may want to go back to using Rehab and American Cream if you want to keep a deeper henna shade.

If you want to feel light and breezy, this conditioner won't weigh you down. My hair feels fluffy and deliciously light and bouncy. I have this strange urge to go wander in lemon orchards, run through mud puddles and pick flowers by the side of the road. 

Now officially in the mood to make lemonade!

You need this product if you

- your skin is sun damaged  
- your skin is aging rapidly  
- you enjoy in-office medical peels

This is a truly amazing product and completely different and unique to anything else on the market. Try it and you'll see.

Each prismatic color cube is in it's own tiny little clear box with a tiny lid on, those I discard and simply keep the top four squares open unless I out the entire top lid on once I'm done doing my makeup.

I love to sweep the palest shimmery vanilla on the entire brow bone and my whole lid, I usually wear black liquid liner right under the lash line and right on top, creating a black back drop that make applying any eye makeup on top easy and gives it great depth. Then I use the darkest color with a short brush I cut on an angle to blend the dark color on top of the liner for a smoky and glowing effect. The other two colors I layer on top in between the vanilla base and the dark smoke, but I don't feel the need to use all four colors at the same time. I also wet the brush sometimes, Visine is good for making liquid liner type of a finish when used on a brush and then dipped in some shadow.

The colors have deep intensity to them and they sparkle like melting precious metals in the sun. Wonderful for any makeup novice or artist for their ease of use and the dramatic and breath taking effect they so easily produce.

While the colors are beautiful, provide lots of shine and are long wearing, they are very sticky. MAC Lip Glass is much stickier, so if you don't mind that, they might be right for you. Also, the good thing about the kit is that you get to try lots of different colors, but the tubes are quite small, with a steep price.

	All the shades are abundantly blessed with Vitamin E, Lanolin and Mineral Oil to soften and smooth lips.  These glaces aren't at all heavy or sticky - they're light, go on easily, evenly, and don't bleed over lip lines if you take a bite of something good.

	Glaces can be worn alone or over lip color if you want to give added gleam to a favorite lipstick"

When she got pregnant several months ago, my wife confessed to me that she really didn't like Acqua di Gio (this after two years! Pregnancy does heighten sensitivity to smell, though). 

I still had some Nautica around, plus the original and no-longer-made Zegna scent from Spain, so I used those for a while. I then bought the newest Zegna cologne, ""Z"", after my wife smelled it and found it unobjectionable.  

Well, no sooner had I bought the Z then my wife found a scratch and sniff of Curve in some magazine and said that I really should be using that. The next day we happened to be at K-Mart -- K-MART!!! -- for some household odds and ends, and my wife came across a display of Curve. She insisted on buying it for me. 

Ever since then, my wife goes nuts when I use it. I don't use it during the week, really -- I'm a somewhat older guy, and it has a sweetish overtone to it that's not very serious -- but whenever I do, my wife always tells me how absolutely wonderful I smell, indeed, how DELICIOUS I smell. Today was casual Friday at work, so I figured, okay. I leave for work very early, before my wife is awake. Sure enough, she calls me at work this morning -- ""you used Curve today, didn't you? I can tell because the bathroom smells wonderful!""

Every woman I know who has commented on it loves it on guys. So it's less expensive and available at K-Mart. And yes it is a little bit sweeter than most colognes I'm personally used to. But it does have a pleasant smell, and if the women love it, well . . . "

I emailed Mistral's customer service asking them to consider making it. I got a reply right away and after a few email exchanges was told they would see what could be done. I like that--being responsive to the customer.
 What do I like about the soap? For one thing, the size. It's huge at 7 oz. I also like the scents offered: Very pleasing combinations that stay on the skin in a subtle way once you rinse and dry. Best of all is how it lathers up on the skin and once rinsed off leaves no residue. It does leave the skin soft."

Amazing, and highly recommended. Soak in the tub/shower/whatever so the hot water softens up your skin, then scrub away. The small bar lasts 2 or 3 uses; the large is twice as big. The small one is more reasonably priced for people who just want to sample the stuff.

This thing has lots of great little scrubby bits in it. Ground rice, ground almonds, AND adzuku beans. Not just one, but three, and they are all super-scrubby. You'll be a little red when you're done, but it's SO worth it once you've cooled off and your skin is as smooth as a baby's bottom.

The only downside is that it makes your tub look like somebody dumped sand into the bottom of it once the thing drains. The bar melts at around 'hot water' temperature, and you're not supposed to use any moisturizer after using this stuff - but you really don't have to! The moisturizing oils in the bar really do work very well. I'll definitely be picking up a couple more of these.

The cocoa butter/lemon/lavendar scent is really amazing as well. Soothing AND refreshing, it can wake you up in the morning or calm you down at night before you go to sleep. Definitely try this thing, though, if you're looking for ultimate exfoliation plus moisturizing"

Marino,"Niagara Falls, NY","I have been struggling with dry skin and mild acne for years. Recently, I revamped my cleansing routine and my makeup. I bought the Philosphy Purity cleanser and Hope in a Jar. It has made an unbelievable difference in my skin! My skin is smooth, not a dry flake anywhere. It is as soft as a baby's butt.

It is worth noting that a little goes a LONG way. You only need a very small amount (about the size of a dime or less) for your whole face. It is a very light texture, almost like a mousse, and glides over your skin and absorbs quickly. If you use too much (I did the first few times)then your face could look greasy. If you remember that less is more, then you will get a perfectly moisturized, yet matte, complexion.

After using the Philosophy cleanser and Hope in a Jar, I use the Bare Escentuals mineral makeup (bought the Light/Fairly Light starter kit). My skin, for the first time ever, is flawless. No acne. No dry skin. No reddish areas. Just a perfectly smooth complexion. I keep looking in the mirror, thinking ""Is this my skin? Really?"" I cannot believe what a difference this product (and the mineral makeup) has made.

I tried several moisterizers sometimes multiple ones but could still see the skin flaking off onto my desk, so I researched this and went to Sephora and bought a kit. I washed my face, did the serum and added this product and I honestly do not see 1 single flake of dry skin, it does tingle but I think it's because my face is raw and so dry but it feels as if my skin is drinking it up like a cold glass of water. I am anxious to see what happens in the weeks to come. I have mild cyctic acne and have struggled with it for years. I decided to see a dermatolist and then got chemical peels it helped to rid me of the bad acne but then I was so dry for 2 wks I couldn't bare to even look at myself. My skin doesn't hurt anymore, for allthe sensitive people, there is a sensitve version but if you have dry skin from the crazy acne treatments they make us do or peels or just dry winter heat, this is the product for you. If it seems strong then use it every other night until you skin can adapt. Or just once a day.

My skin has never been healthier!! The lesions (which were scaly, itchy, and red) are healed and the overall apperance of my skin has improved dramatically and is much more even.

Then I sampled it at a department store and all my nose could think was ""Wow!"" - gardenias from my grandmother's garden, the suntan oils & tropical perfumes that I smelled as a little girl at the beach, with a few more florals blended in that make this fragrance even more exotic and sensual - I knew I had to have it! I bought myself a bathgel and lotion set and put the large bottle of cologne on my X-mas list, which my sweet & generous boyfriend got for me. 
In my opinion, this is probably the most alluring fragrance for women that I have ever smelled. I feel very alluring every time I wear it for my boyfriend - and he loves it! So this would be a great gift for a man's wife or girlfriend, or for a woman's best friend, sister or cousin (as long as you wear it for your own man, too!), but a slightly awkward gift to give to your mother, aunt or grandmother - it's that enticing. But if your single older relative or friend simply must have it as one of her gifts, then have it given by one of her female friends, sister, cousin or ""Santa"". That way there won't be any awkwardness at gift-giving time. Believe me - this fragrance is the olfactory equivalent of French lingerie or a string bikini! "

I opened the bottle to take a whiff and my oh my, it's definitely worth the price tag.
The real test of course came at bath time, and this sure delivered beyond looks alone.

The bath water turned bubbly and luscious with earthy aromas of warm, primrose vanilla and the rich, juicy and creamy finish of the apricot. This should be eaten, not bathed in!
Insanely delicious as it would make a wonderful present for any friend or relative, but better yet for yourself.

 Apparently this can be used as a body wash, and I am really looking forward to using it in the shower, as I'm a shower person in the morning, and this would make a tantalizing shower experience for sure. I have reviewed a few of these bath items today, and now I feel so sweet and sleepy after my bath that I feel extremely happy for getting this bubble bath. It's little delectable products such as this one that bring you calm and pleasantness after a long day, and nothing can replace some nice relaxation alone in the tub.

My only question about this product is whether the vitamin C in it is stable (i.e., should the product be refrigerated to maintain its potency?).  Regardless, it has a sufficient amount of vitamin C for the product to be worthwhile (10% - woo hoo!), and other vitamin C creams are much more expensive.  

The nice thing about this product is that a little really does go a long way.  You squeeze a small amount onto your finger (hygienic packaging!) and spread onto your face.  As the product spreads, it absorbs and has a silky finish.  I'm not sure why, but I have taken to mixing this product with a little bit of Cetaphil moisturizer and I love the result.

	Their Almond & Aloe Liquid Soap is a boon because it not only cleanses well but moisturizes as it does so.  Far too many soaps leave skin feeling dry and itchy.

	Almond, as we  know, has a lovely distinctive fragrance as well as skin softening properties.  Combine it with aloe which contains healing properties, and you have a uniquely beneficial cleanser.

	Other ingredients include Vitamins A and D for nourishment.  This soap is particularly useful for those who wash their hands frequently during the day and for those with normal to dry or sensitive skin.

Mills,"Santaquin, Utah USA","About 10 years ago, I began getting ingrown whiskers on my neck from shaving.  Not only did they not feel good (they'd itch, and were sensitive) but they looked horrible. The front of my neck was red, and I would have horrible red and white bumps all over the skin where whiskers would curl and grow back down into the skin.  I was totally self concsious, because it looked horrible.  The only thing I could for the longest time was pluck them with tweezers.  That took a lot of time, and digging into my skin to pull the hairs was very uncomfortable, and really didn't work that well.  I tried switching to an electric razor with little success.  I could not have a close shave on my neck without getting the horrible ingrown hairs.

I searched the web for months to try and find something that would work.  I found some advice for a few different things, but none worked.  I finally ran across a website of a distributor that was selling Tend Skin.  By that point I wasn't sure anything would work, but I was desperate for something, so I bought it.  I am SO glad I did.  It really works when you use it as directed, and you see results by the time you have to shave again.

I apply Tend Skin with a cotton ball or pad to my neck after I shave and dry my face.  I will then apply it again in the evening, and repeat each morning and night.  It does not take much at all.  I always buy the largest bottle for fear that one day Tend Skin will disappear!  If you have ingrown facial hair from shaving, you NEED to get this.  It is the only thing that I have found the works, and I am 100% happy with it.  It is rather pricey, but I never hesitate to buy because it is worth every penny to me.

The only small ""complaint"" I have about it is that it smells just a tad funny to me.  My wife says it smells fine to her, so I don't worry about it.  I wonder if they could make it with a slightly nicer smell - or none at all.  It really doesn't matter, though, because Tend Skin is AWESOME and I don't know what I'd do without it.

I can't speak to how effective it is for ingrown leg hair, etc. but I would imagine it would work the same"

Leis ""yakh262""",Florida United States,"I have used Tend Skin for around three years now for razor bumps on the bikini line. Before I started using it, I had tried everything else and resigned to the fact that I'd always be stuck with bumps along the bikini line. A friend of mine told me about Tend Skin and swore by it, so I bought a small bottle. It seemed like it was expensive, but that first bottle lasted well over 6 months. It does smell like alcohol at first but the smell goes away when it dries. As far as the other reviews on here, I've only had stinging when I used it IMMEDIATELY after shaving...I think b/c the pores were still open from the shower. For me, it's been a skin saver when I'd already given up the search. I hope that the negative reviews on here don't discourage people from trying it. Everyone's skin reacts somewhat differently. Of the millions of bottles of Tend Skin sold every year, I think the half dozen people on here who didn't like it are the few unhappy rarities, not the average who, like me, thank goodness it's around."

It moisturizes really well and I use it every ten days or so. It smells like a weird salad dressing when you put it on, kind of vinegary and spicy, but when you wash it out the scent is toned down a bit. It still smells unusual (spicy and vaguely nutty), but not unpleasant.

I warm a good handful of this in the microwave, put it on my dry hair and tie it in a bun, wait 20 minutes, then shampoo it out using a liquid shampoo and condition with a light conditioner, like Coolaulin or a small amount of American Cream. If you have short hair you probably won't need this deep of a treatment, but for those of us with a lot of hair, or who have damaged or very thick hair, it is great. It makes my hair shiny and tangle-free again.

It doesn't have any of the silicones that commercial conditioners have, so if you are looking for that slick feeling you get from Pantene you won't find it here. But the ingredients in this don't build up in your hair the way silicones do, so for those of us who are making a conscious choice to avoid silicone buildup in our hair, this is a great deep conditioner"

Ever since finding LUSH several months ago, I have not even touched another brand of hair care.

HSuan Wen Hua Hair Treatment is made with fresh ingredients like bananas, avocadoes and fresh olive oil.  

You use this BEFORE you wash your hair, so apply it to DRY hair.  I usually put my hair up in a pony tail and only do the ends because that's where the damage is.  Then I twist my hair up in a bun and rubberband a plastic bag over it.  I try to leave it on as long as I can (overnight if I'm lucky), shampoo my hair and condition like regular after.  Because this is a treatment and not so much a hair conditioner, you still need to use a seperate conditioner.

The results are amazing and my hair is so much softer and in such better condition after use.  Since I only do the ends, it's easy to feel the difference between the ends of my hair that was treated and the rest of my hair that was not.

HSuan Wen Hua Hair Treatment is a M-U-S-T for my hair regime.  Definately recommended"
B000225ZM4:simply_amazing:angelina,B000225ZM4,HSuan Wen Hua Hair Treatment by LUSH: Beauty,beauty,8 of 9,5.0,Simply Amazing,"October 12, 2005",Angelina,"Tulsa, Ok"," This treatment works extremely well!  I looked on here and saw that there were no extrememly helpful reviews, so I decided to write one. I have long, golden, untreated hair. However it was as dry as straw so I decided to try this. Here how it is: the smell is amazing (it smells like pumpkin pie or gingerbread cookies) after use the hair looks soft and shiny, however it makes hair flat. This product is a deep moisturizer therefore the hair does not have any ""pouf"" to it. It is still worth the money though! Rehydration of the hair is supremely important and this rehydrates well. Just after shampooing do not use a conditioner (unless that just doesn't work well for you), which helps the flatness. 

A few helpful tips:
1. This goes on DRY hair
2. After putting lots of this treatment on, try putting a bag over your hair and keeping it shut with a clip. The heat that your head produces allows the hair cuticles to open and fully absorb the treatment. This works 2Xs better than Lush's intstructions (my mother is a hairstylist).
3. Leave the bag tight around your head for 20 to 40 minutes
4. Afterwards shampoo like normal, but I still recommend not using a conditioner for that day.

Hopefully this helps anyone with questions. This really is an amazing product and should be used about twice a month (more if you'd like but that's probably not necessary). Enjoy your beatiful shiny hair!"

However, since I only use this as a back scrub brush, the detachable design is not optimal for me.

At this point, many more months down the road, the brush no longer stays mounted to the handle at all, so I am looking for a (non-detachable) replacement.

Avocado is one of the heavier, thicker oils and did wonders for my dry skin, but I hated the feel of it, so finding this was a real bonus to fix that problem.  

Lavender oil also has relaxing aromatherapeutic properties, is a natural antiseptic which helps prevent blemishes, and mosquitoes don't like it, so if you have oily skin and live in a humid climate in the summer, you should try this!

Mistral, as I was happy to discover, is also the name of a line of bath and body products, all French inspired, all lusciously lovely from scented soaps to soothing lotions to rejuvenating body butters. 

Matthew Tilker, founder and president of Mistral, utilizes Shea butter, which is an efficacious natural healer, in a myriad of must-have forms. Derived from the nuts of the African Shea Tree (according to sacred custom the nuts are harvested primarily by women), this butter is highly emollient, a boon for those with dry skin, chapped lips, any number of skin irritations. 

The pure Shea Butter soap comes in a plethora of inviting fragrances, all milled six times (while others boast being triple milled). South Seas is a particular favorite - it's as fresh as an ocean breeze and as calming, soothing as a tropical island. The marine scent is accented with a touch of grapefruit, white flowers and soft woods. An irresistible combination. 

South Seas is a fragrance with which you wish to surround yourself - made possible by the shower gel, body lotion, massage bath and body oil, bath salts and candle all available at very accessible prices.

However, this Neostrata AHA 8 significantly reduced bumps and redness after only 2 weeks.  After 4 weeks, it had almost vanished.  The only drawback is that after 2-3 weeks of non-use the bumps tend to resurface.  But, if you keep the application up, the bumps stay away!

Ressmeyer,,"As a working mom in her mid-forties, I am ever hopeful when it comes to product claims of time savings and beauty enhancement.  And so, when I read about the T3 Tourmaline Ionic Hair Dryer, I just had to have one.  With a price tag of $200, I figured the claims just had to be true.

The T3 is a sleek, beautiful and lighweight hairdrying and styling tool.  With its ionic particle things, it sounds so scientific, too.  But does it do what it says it will do?

For me, it's hard to tell.  It does dry at least as fast as my old 1800 watt hair dryer but with seemingly less heat.  So arguably, it is faster.  Less heat also means less hair damage.  So arguably, that is a beauty enhancement.  Is my hair sleeker and shinier?  Again, hard to tell.  No one at the office the next day seemed to notice any change.

One thing that I do notice, however, is that I like the idea of using an ionic hair dryer.  For whatever reason, I do think it is good for my hair.  And I suppose that in and of itself is enough to make this purchase entirely worthwhile"

Often times I would let my hair dry naturally rather than blow dry it because of the hassle and time - not because it looked better, it looked terrible.  This dryer dries my hair in 15 minutes (fully blown under and styled), on top of that my hair is shiny when it's done and not dry.  I just bought one for my mom and would recommend this blow dryer for anyone that normally spends more than 20 minutes drying their hair, you will absolutely cut the dry time 50%.  Great purchase!"

However air drying my hair seemed to take forever. It was then that I heard about the T3 tourmaline Professional Ionic Hair Dryer from my hairdresser.  Initially the $200 price tag did put me off and I pushed the idea aside. But somehow it remained somewhere in the corner of my mind and one fine day after getting late for a meeting yet again, I decided to bite the bullet and buy the hairdryer. 

And I tell you, I have never been happier using a hair dryer. My hair started looking better and less damaged in the first few weeks itself. It has become smooth and silky and has a healthy glow.  Though the weight and the time taken were almost similar to my old model, the after effect is worth the price paid. The product does come with a 4-year warranty which is an added advantage to justify the exorbitant price. Though the sales brochures uses a lot of scientific terms like ionic mineral and blah... blah... I am not going to bother about it much as far as my hair appears healthy and saves me time so that I don't have to deal with being late for meetings.

I have very fine, bodyless hair that is short and  high- and low-lighted.  I usually use Aquage products because they don't weight my hair down and especially  like the thickening spraygel for body.

Jonathan products smell great.  Additionally, I had no problem with the size of the bottles.  The quantity is probably the same as any other good product.  First the volumizing shampoo:  it lathered just fine and I used only a small amount.  I could feel the volumizing effect right after rinsing, after which I used the volumizing conditioner.  Again, no problem.  I decided to forego the thickening spraygel that I usually use in order to give Dirt an honest try.

I think I need a little more practice with this product since I am not a hairdresser.  I used the smallest amount and my hair was slightly damp.  I also need a haircut at the moment.  Next time I will put it on completely dry hair and apply it from the bottom going up and underneath.  It worked okay, but I need to get used to it.

I have very fine, bodyless hair that is short and  high- and low-lighted.  I usually use Aquage products because they don't weight my hair down and especially  like the thickening spraygel for body.

Jonathan products smell great.  Additionally, I had no problem with the size of the bottles.  The quantity is probably the same as any other good product.  First the volumizing shampoo:  it lathered just fine and I used only a small amount.  I could feel the volumizing effect right after rinsing, after which I used the volumizing conditioner.  Again, no problem.  I decided to forego the thickening spraygel that I usually use in order to give Dirt an honest try.

I think I need a little more practice with this product since I am not a hairdresser.  I used the smallest amount and my hair was slightly damp.  I also need a haircut at the moment.  Next time I will put it on completely dry hair and apply it from the bottom going up and underneath.  It worked okay, but I need to get used to it.

Anyone who is that determined to make the best product on the market, obviously will do whatever it takes to make it happen.
After seeing how much the product was, I cringed at the fact that a bottle of shampoo would be that much. I later, literally dragged myself to Sephora to purchase this shampoo/conditioner after knowing that I was willing to take a risk that could eventually end up in my closet.
I bought it, went straight to my bathroom, and washed my hair. The shampoo did not lather, which I expected considering there is no harsh detergents or sodium lauryl sulfate. The conditioner was a very light, thin substance. Definitely not thick. 
Finale-Dried my hair, and right there, I knew that this product is definitely the BEST hair product BY FAR, that I have ever used. My hair, is very damaged, brittle and FULL of split ends. This product made my hair, very very full, FULL of shine, and very soft. My hair was beautiful for days....
Last test.. going to work. As soon as I put my hair down from a pony tail (I'm a waitress), INSTANTLY everyone noticed my hair. They asked ""what did you do?? your hair is soo beautiful"".. I told them ""40 dollar shampoo and conditioner"" WELL WORTH THE COST. Definitely a salon in a bottle. Now my worst fear is that it will be discontinued for any reason. And if so, I am willing spend 1k to stock up and save as much as I can. There is no other product like it"

And so, when I read about the T3 Tourmaline Ionic Hair Dryer, I just had to have one.  With a price tag of $200, I figured the claims just had to be true.

The T3 is a sleek, beautiful and lighweight hairdrying and styling tool.  With its ionic particle things, it sounds so scientific, too.  But does it do what it says it will do?

For me, it's hard to tell.  It does dry at least as fast as my old 1800 watt hair dryer but with seemingly less heat.  So arguably, it is faster.  Less heat also means less hair damage.  So arguably, that is a beauty enhancement.  Is my hair sleeker and shinier?  Again, hard to tell.  No one at the office the next day seemed to notice any change.

One thing that I do notice, however, is that I like the idea of using an ionic hair dryer.  For whatever reason, I do think it is good for my hair.  And I suppose that in and of itself is enough to make this purchase entirely worthwhile"

It is packed with other great ingredients like vitamins A, E and K and anti-oxidants like grapeseed extract. There is another skin care company that bases its whole line on grapeseed extract alone. It has phospholipids which binds water to the skin. Also anti-inflammatories like extract of orange, geranium and lavander. There's been recent research by those such as Dr. Perricone, for example, about the damage inflammation does to the whole body, the skin included. It really leaves the skin feeling soft and hydrated.

My primary need was for a cordless clipper and Andis appeared to be about the only one available that  Icould find.  The purchase was a bit pricy but I'm totally happy with how they function.  The products are quality made and handle very nicely.  There is more power provided when the clippers are plugged in, but for my needs, real close cut every 2-3 days, they work perfect.  I recharge my clippers once a week.  The instructions suggest that every 60 days you let the clippers run until the battery runs out.  I did this once, but got tired of waiting for the clippers to stop, so my impression is that I could probably go for 2 weeks between charging the battery.  Overall I consider them to be a very nice set of clippers/trimmers"

Bath Bombs are made of sodium bicarbonate, so they're like ""alka seltzers"" for the bath.

Some of the LUSH Bath Bombs contain petals and other plant parts and Still Life is no exception. Mine was FILLED with sunflower petals--even a complete flower and a leaf! 

Although bathing with such Bath Bombs are luxurious, the clean up can be quite messy. (When my husband came into the bathroom while I was bathing, he exclaimed ""What the heck is THAT?!"" Why, it's sunflower petals, my dear...)

I had a first rate mess on my hands after the bath. I had to keep clearing the drain for the water to go down. THEN I had to do it a few more times before I could finally RINSE the tub!

If you don't mind the LUSH Bath Bombs that include petals and other flora and fauna--and you love bright, citrusy scents--you'll likely LOVE Still Life Bath Bomb. It smells heavenly, and tints the water with a golden hue.

However, if you don't like plant parts floating in your bath--nor the clean up involved afterwards--steer clear of Still Life"

My under eye area looks more natural as well, covering the dark circles and veins.

The bare Radiance All Over Face Color has too much shimmer for me so I gave that to my daughter.  But the Glee is perfect.  I use this in place of the Warmth and am happier with the color.  Just a different tone to use, especially if you already have a red/ruddy complexion.

Faux Tan All Over Face Color is something I plan on using this summer, perhaps mixing with Glee for a sun kissed look.

The brushes included with the kits, really are Strokes of genius and worth every penny!  I find no comparison to any other brushes (Mary Kay, Estee Lauder etc) that I own.

I started to use soaps and creams mainly because they provide better value for the money and they help my sensitive skin.

I have always had sensitive skin and shaving never helped. I recently came across Truefitt & Hill Trafalgar and figured that if it was good enough for royalty, then I should give it a try. I can definitely see why this is the official royal shaving cream. It wasn't until I tried this cream and combined it with a Merkur Futur double-edged razor and badger brush that I knew what it was to have a close shave with no razor burn.

Like the previous reviewer said, most people need to realize that very little goes a long way. With just a small dab on a wet badger brush you will be able to create a warm and thick lather that will make you love shaving.

Shaving the old fashioned way will take a bit longer, but it will feel luxurious and the results are much better than anything you can get with a Mach 3 and a can of gel. I can finally go a whole day without shaving. If I go two days, I have a nice 5 o'clock shadow around 8.

This is the best bet for a shave cream. It smells very good and provides more than enough lubrication for a razor to simply glide over. A badger brush is a must though. Truefitt & Hill Trafalgar is simply fantastic."

Swansen,"Jackson Hole, USA","I recently started wet shaving (within the last two months) and have come to regard shaving as something I look forward to now.  I use a Merkur Futura double-edged razor and have bought an assortment of different shaving creams to try, including Prorasso (italian eucalyptus stuff), Taylor of Bond Street (avocado) and the Truefitt & Hill Traflagar.  My top choice is the Trufitt & Hill hands down.

While many people might see the $22 as expensive, most people need to realize that a very little goes a long way.  This is not like the Edge Gel or Barbasol that you learned to shave with.  This just requires a dab on the wet brush (a real badger hair brush) and a swirl in a small bowl sitting in a a bit of hot drawn water to create a warm and thick lather that will make you enjoy shaving again.  I would estimate this jar will last about 6 months.

In looking at the cost of my new shave method (52 blades a year ($0.50 each), two jars of shaving cream a year ($22 each) comes to about $70 a year.  Compare this to a blade every other week and a can of alcohol-based shave gel (which dries your skin) every other month for a cost of $60.  Ten bucks more a year buys a much better shave.

I've noticed that my shaves take a bit longer, but my skin has cleared up of many of the bumps that I used to have.  I also no longer have a 5 o'clock shadow at 3 in the afternoon.  Best of all the shave is the closest thing I've ever had to the shave I got from a barber in Florence, Italy using a steady hand and a scary looking straight blade.

This is the best bet for a shave cream !"

B00021DJ5A:rich_and_creamy_shower_gel:lh422,B00021DJ5A,Philosophy Melon Daiquiri: Beauty,beauty,3 of 3,5.0,Rich and creamy shower gel,"October 2, 2006",LH422,USA,"This is one of Philosophy's 3-in-1 products.  It can be used as shampoo, bubble bath, and shower gel.  I've only used it as a shower gel, so that's all I'm able to review here.  As a shower gel, this product is exceptional.  It's an extremely rich and thick gel, and produces a generous lather with abundant bubbles.  I find it to be somewhat moisturizing- it doesn't explicitly moisturize my skin, but it also doesn't dry it out, even in the winter.  In addition, the gel is opaque and creamy, rather than clear, like most shower gel.  The melon daquiri scent is summery and fruity.  It's a pleasant sweet melons scent.  It doesn't smell especially alcoholic; though it's part of Philosophy's line of 3-in-1s meant to smell like fruity cocktails- like margaritas and pina coladas.  The scent is more fruity melon than alcoholic melon.  That said, people who like juicy, fruity scents will likely love this.  

While I haven't tried using this as a bubble bath or shampoo, the rich lather I get from the shower gel suggests to me that it would probably work very well as the other two parts of the 3-in-1.  The one thing that may be problematic for people- the scent doesn't last beyond the shower.  I can't smell it on my skin anymore when I get out of the shower, though the scent is quite strong while in use.  Some people may find that problematic.  I like that it doesn't clash with my perfume, so it's okay for me. "

Healthy Hair Butter for my dry, breaking, relaxed hair from Sephora. It has the consistency of Vaseline and when I applied it to my dried hair after washing, it felt very stiff and heavy. It was hard to comb my hair even with my wide-toothed comb and for a few minutes I regretted getting it thinking it would stay like this. I tied my hair into a loose ponytail, and wrapped it with a satin scarf for 20 minutes. When I removed the scarf my hair was unbelievably SOFT and smooth! It felt incredible. It absorbed very well into the hair. I was able to comb through it easily. It felt silky but slightly greasy, but that may have been my fault for adding too much. This is an excellent all-natural conditioner and it smells fantastic. Like lemons and mint and garden fresh. The only issues I have with it are that it's very heavy, so on relaxed hair apply it sparingly, or it will get greasy and weighty. This will be great for controlling new growth. Next time I'll try applying it to wet hair. Overall great product"

Justice,"Pittsburgh, PA","I'm 28 and have always had what I would call average skin, the kind that most women have. I have normal skin with a little more oiliness in the T-Zone and I get blackheads and the occasional breakout. I have tried all kinds of different product lines (Urban Defense, DDF, Dior, Philosphy, Bliss, etc.) and am the happiest with the results I get from Murad. 
I have been using Murad for about 2 1/2 years now so I have tried a lot of the Murad products and found a routine that works great for me. 

In the morning I use the AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser (love it! the gritiness gives you very smooth surface for applying makeup) then the Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel and the Skin Perfecting Lotion which I mix and apply together so that I don't use as much. Last I put on my Moisture Silk Eye Gel and I'm ready to go.  

At night I use the Clarifying Cleanser followed by the Clarifying Toner, the Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel, the Perfecting Lotion and the best product of all the Night Reform Treatment (see my review of that product for details, I love it!) and again I use the Moisture Silk Eye Gel. 

Once a week I throw in the Exfoliating Fruit Enzyme Mask and I have perfect skin if I stick to the program everyday. My skin looks and feels better than it ever has and people always guess my age to be around 23 so it must be doing something right! 

Top 5 Favorite Murad Products:
1. Soothing Lip Therapy
2. Night Reform Treatment
3. Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel
4. AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser
5. Clarifying Cleanser

Murad Products that I don't like:
1. Day Reform Treatment (too greasy and I hate the smell)
2. Purifying Face Scrub 
3. The products for combination skin - they are ok but the acne line is so mild that people with combination skin will see better results using it. (I have used both product lines)"

I've always wanted products with the highest SPF available.  But the problem that I've always run into is that if you want a moisturizer with SPF included, it's usually on SPF 15 or 20...and that is simply not acceptable for me.

Higher SPFs always tended to be much heavier and oilier than I would like, and they caused me to break out frequently - Until Clarins UV Plus!  I am totally in love with this stuff!  It's a tiny tube that will literally last forever!  It has SPF 40 - which is enough protection from practically everything! It has anti-oxidants to fend off pollution.  What more could you ask for.  Yes, it is $35...but keep in mind that you will still need a separate moisturizer.  I use Hope in a Jar on freshly cleansed skin and then I apply my Clarins UV Plus, and I'm good to go.

I also used to spend more money on expensive razors to get a closer shave; I now only use the cheapie razors & my legs are so much smoother than before! I also use this under my arms & have NO irritation (this was another hesitation, as I have very sensative skin). 

The fragrance is amazing as well. Sweet, as in the name, but not overpowering. This works very well as a layering to Benefit's other scented products, or their Maybe Baby fragrance, as they all smell similar enough to compliment one another."

It smells to me like mocha coffee, and I absolutely LOVE the smell, when I'm using it I run my hands through my hair and sniff them constantly - my husband laughs at me. I do think it's an earthy smell that some people would not like, though. It's kind of like patchouli, you either love it or hate it.

It reminds me of glorified coco butter with just a few more ingredients (and coco butter is way cheaper). 

I will use Ojon Restorative Hair Treatment again, but probably only on the weekends when I'm not going to work (because of the oily look).  

The bottom line is, definately smell it first to make sure you like it!  They sell it at Pure Beauty stores, among other places.  And, if you can try it somewhere before you buy it, do it!  Make sure it doesn't give you the ""oily"" look"

Second, the hair treatment is absolutely great for hair that has been in braided styles for extended periods of time or has just been mistreated and needs a little TLC.

You just have to get the right color of concealer for your skin complexion.

I try to take good care of my skin and have tried just about every ""fine line"" or general facial moisturizing cream available over the years.  

I purchased some makeup recently from Sephora.com and got a free sample of the Kinerase cream and decided to try it.  Within two days (no kidding) I noticed a difference in my skin tone.  I began to notice a more ""fresh"" look - rosy, if you will.  I had some light freckles as well, which started getting even lighter.  

I decided right then and there to get some of this cream, as I was quickly running out of the small free sample.  That was when I learned how expensive it is.  :-(  However, I decided that since this has made more of a difference in my skin in just DAYS that I would bite the bullet and spend the money.

I can't tell yet whether it's really helping some of the fine lines I have, but just based on what it's done for my skin tone and color -- I can honestly say it's worth every single penny.

Montgomery ""mercedes307--Contributing Author for Highland Press's Second Time Around Anthology""","Columbus, GA","I've been using this product, along with the mild facial soap and dramatically different moisturizer, for fourteen years now. I remember my consultation with the Clinique rep like it was yesterday. And therein lies the rub--if you've never used these products and are considering doing so, it is best to visit a Clinique representative to help you decide which products are best for your skin. A lot of times, people do not know what skin type they have or think they have one when it's really another. If you're not using the right ones for your skin type, you won't get the results you need. The Clinique reps can help. Talk to them first and then you can purchase anywhere!

I myself have the combination skin. The Clinique rep warned me that I might have some initial blemishes, and I did, but they tapered off after a week or so. Just out of the shower, or after a long day of who knows what may have gotten on your skin, this is an uplifting, cooling-when-it's-hot, breath of fresh zinginess. Often one all over swipe with this on a cotton ball is not enough--so use the other side of the puff, dab on more clarifying lotion and apply again, and maybe more with another cotton ball till it no longer turns any shade. This is worth it. You are taking off not only the makeup that the facial soap may not have caught, but any impurities that daily activity can attract to the skin--dirty fingers unconciously rubbed over the neck or cheek, etc. Follow up with the Clinique moisturizer that's right for you and your skin will feel five times lighter. Your skin is important. These products have helped mine stay in amazing shape over the years"

I have dry, sensitive skin and when assessed by the girls at the clinique counter I came out as a skin type I/II.  I use the extra mild facial soap, the clarifying moisture lotion 2 and the dramatically different moisturising lotion.  

When I looked at the reviews here on amazon I was suprised to find so many people were unhappy with the product, but I happened to go to the clinique counter the other day and found that in Australia there are two ranges of clarifying lotions, the original, which was what everyone was talking about, and the new moisture lotions.  According to the sales assistants the new moisture lotion was developed for the asian market and is alcohol free and being in the asian region Australia luckily gets both.

They exfoliate like the regular lotions but there is no sting or tingle and the skin feels really soft.

1.	Beauty is only skin deep (read: physical beauty is superficial). 
2.	Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder (read: everyone is beautiful).

If anything my decade and half long stint as stylist and fashion editor has taught me, it is that a) physical beauty might be skin deep but its creation and maintenance is as complex a task as coming up with the theory of relativity b) beauty never lies in the eyes of the beholder...all beauty is about tricking the beholder to feel in a certain kind of way.

So banish all your old worn out mantras about beauty and adopt a new one. Beauty is hard work and Beauty is savvy. The Body Shop Skin Focus Face Illuminator passes both these litmus tests. For starters you are going to save a cool 14 bucks when you add this petite tube to your arsenal and before you scream, ""what about quality?"" let me assure you that a few dabs of this booster boy at the beginning or the end of your day (remember to wash and pat dry your face though) and your face will glow with that fresh faced allure that you last saw only in the black and white scrap books of your grandma.

	Best part is that the color lasts all day and into evening without fading or running.  It can be used either wet or dry depending on the effect you want.  And, of course, they both come in Mercier's trim mirrored signature compact.

Okay.  Think ""Carrie"" on TV's enormously successful ""Sex and the City.""  She was the gal who dressed to the nines - always with style and glamour.  She brings both of those qualities to her first fragrance, ""Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker.""

	It's a unique, almost indescribable blend of classicism, chic, and innocence.  There's not a scent like it with top notes of fresh Mandarin, Bergamot, Lavender, and Apple Martini. Vibrant and warm it's  a fragrance that caresses the senses.

	Middles notes are Patchouli, tender Paper Whites, and luxe Orchid.  These are enhanced by bottom notes of irresistible white amber, sensuous cedar, and the very sultry musk.  This is a scent I revel in, and  enjoy wearing.

	The bottle is, of course, simple and exquisite, curved with polished glass, ultra feminine.

	Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker is a beautiful, dreamy yet quite alive fragrance appropriate for every occasion"

It can be too hard to control the applicator, especially if you want to apply under the lower lashes. Since this is a brush on liquid eyeliner, it can't easily be smudged for a smoky look. Of course, the fact that it can't be smudged, once it is dried, is the whole point of this product. It can be cleaned up before it dries, but once it sets, it will stay there until you take it off. When you want to take it off, it comes off very easily, and cleanly, and really doesn't require anything but plain water to remove. I've found that very helpful when I travel. I also have sensitive eyes, but this product has not bothered me at all, probably because it doesn't flake or transfer into my eyes.

I've had some success in the past with using straight jojoba and coconut oil on the eczema patches - but not enough to keep up with the hassle of oily spots of skin. I even tried making my own recipes - to some success. But, it was time consuming and I just don't have the time to mess around with kitchen cosmetics for a hobby.
After looking at the reviews for various types of lotions/creams in the Lush line, I decided to give this one a go. I've only been using it for a couple of days, but already my skin is less irritated, and the scaliness seems to be diminishing some. (eczema strikes the top of my feet and a bit of the ankle... makes wearing combat boots a bit annoying when its acting up)
I'll probably need another week or two of steady use to really know if it works as I'm hoping, but so far so good...
There's no real strong scent to the lotion - so it shouldn't bother those who are sensitive to smells. So also pretty cool on that end as well :-)
Works great on the rest of my skin as well!! No more dryness from the winter weather anymore"

The wax kit did come with `Soothing Oil' that is suppose to help, but it's too oily to leave on the skin.

I've been a LUSH fan for a while, and the sales person led me to Dream Cream.  It has really soothing ingredients, like oat milk, olive oil, chamomile, and tea tree oil, so I took a sample home.

I just waxed tonight and put Dream Cream on after.  What a HUGE difference.  There was very minimal redness and no irritated bumps.  I usually get these mosquito-like bumps whenever I wax, but I didn't get any.  The next morning, I couldn't even tell I just waxed my arms because my skin was so ""normal"".

Dream Cream also works great to cut down on red bumps after shaving, and as a soothing lotion for itchy skin.  I will be getting more to use after waxing and shaving.  Definitely worth trying.  It's not LUSH's best selling lotion for no reason"

Since a family member was undergoing both chemotherapy and radiation therapy, I thought I would buy a tub and see if it did indeed relieve the horrid eczema-like patches of skin covering her body. I figured we had nothing to lose; we had tried everything else and had not found anything that worked yet. Being eternal skeptics, I have to say that we were both pleasantly surprised at how well it worked. It immediately relived the burning and itching that often accompanies dry skin. It took a couple of days of liberally applying the lotion 2-4 times a day for the swelling and redness to diminish, but it did finally disappear. I think if you have standard dry skin, applying it this often might make you feel a bit on the greasy side.  I found that it if you have particularly painful dry skin, it helps to keep the tub of Dream Cream in the refrigerator. The coolness of the lotion further augments the relieving properties of the essential oils in the cream. 
	
I would have to say that a little of this cream does go quite a long way.  If you slather a ton of it on at once, it will leave you feeling a bit sticky. An earlier review mentioned that it can leave you feeling greasy if you put it on your face; however, it should be noted that Dream Cream is meant to be used on the hands and body and not meant to be used as a facial moisturizer. 

I would also have to say that the scent is definitely herbal, but the scent (at least for my tub of Dream Cream) was quite subtle.  I did not find it overwhelming. If you are particularly fond of the strong scents that characterize many of Lush's products, then you might be disappointed in this cream. But, if you have dry, itchy, scaly skin, I would strongly recommend this cream.  It is expensive, but it is definitely worth it. "

I love the smell, like sniffing a real lemon, not a fake lemon scent. Very fresh and clean.  I am following it up with the lemon body souffle and Sweet sugar cologne for a cool, light summery scent. 
As for those who say Philosophy's products cost a lot- they pay a living wage to their employees and put more money on high-quality ingredients for the product, not on packaging and advertising.  Not to get heavy, but I'd rather have a really good quality product than have my dollars going to fancy packaging and an advertising campaign featuring some over-priced cokehead model.

Well the fact is that there are a lot of soap products that you can use in the shower, for washing your hair, and also for a bubble bath.  

It lathers up nicely but not excessively......  so what??


Well the most unique thing about this product is the lemon scent.  I love this.  It is very strong and it also manages to scent up the bathroom when I am taking a shower.  I really like the scent of lemons.  If you dont like it then there are other products.  They have this in apple, coconut and some other scent........maybe strawberry??  I personally like the lemon scent the most.  
I have tried other philosophy products and honestly they do not have a bad one.  They do not advertise this but if this stuff does get in your eyes, it stings very little.  

The only drawback is the fact that it is quite frankly expensive........ about a dollar an ounce. There are other products....and I guess you still need a conditioner for your hair"

It wasn't unusual for me to wash my face three to four times a day to keep it from shining.  As a result of the oily skin and humid temps (I live in S.

A friend suggested Clinique and though the oil isn't completely gone...which wouldn't be desireable anyways...it is finally manageable.

I got the DDM lotion as part of the three step program Clinique offers, but I think that the lotion is solely responsible for the changes in my skin.  I could leave or take the toner and soap, which don't seem to be any different than less expensive versions readily available at drugstores.  The lotion though...Wow!  It doesn't go on greasy or watery.  Instead, it has a nice and light consistency that is easy to smooth over your skin but is thick enough that it's not hard to contain or control with your fingertips.  As soon as you rub it in, you notice the mattifying properties.  The lotion actually helps to reduce shine by itself, but without any tightness or by depriving your skin of its moisture.  Some of the stuff I've tried in the past only dried my skin out temporarily and then the oil glands would really start to kick in with a vengence, but with this lotion I haven't had any of those problems.  My skin is now smoother than it's ever been, and the oil glands are apparently appeased as well because I haven't had to wash my face in the middle of the afternoons anymore. "

It's a little piece of paper that says ""BOMB!""

I prefer the bubble bars because I like bubble baths and also they are more economical as you can break them up and use them for more than one bath, but sometimes throwing a whole bomb in is a treat in itself.

For a really indulgent experience, try 1/3 of a Creamy Candy bubble slice with the Blackberry bomb - it makes purple bubbles and smells so yummy. But only for those who like strong scented baths I think.."

It smells a bit like grape Kool-Aid, but not as sweet or syrupy. The smell is not as strong as some of Lush's other bath bombs, but it is quite pleasant.

The bomb turns the bath water a wonderfully relaxing purple color. As with  most bath bombs from Lush, it will leave a ring around the tub. In order to remedy this, I usually wipe the tub down with my washcloth after I am done with my bath. Granted, this is not the way that one wants to cap off a relaxing bath, but it will save the agony of having to scrub the tub the following morning. 

The bomb turns the water quite soft and will leave your skin feeling delightfully supple. I was quite pleased with this aspect of the bomb. The scent it leaves on your skin is subtle and lasted for a couple of days.  This is definitely one of Lush's more simple bath bombs, but it is definitely not boring. The small surprise that accompanies the bomb somewhat compensates for the lack of glitter and more powerful floral/fruit scent. 

Not one of the more memorable bombs, but really quite pleasing. If you want to take a break from some of Lush's more overpowering products, this bomb is for you."

I've found it to be less drying than many other soaps, and less drying than certain of Lush's other soaps (the glycerin ones, like Bohemian and Sea Vegetable.)  While the creaminess is certainly an asset, it also means that the soap melts away quickly, as another reviewer mentioned.  As this is a somewhat expensive soap, more than $7 for about 3 oz., this is definitely something to consider before purchasing.  A bar of this soap lasts me about a week, showering every day.  Admittedly I'm a fairly enthusiastic user, and it's likely possible to use a bit less, but I'm not sure that would make a huge difference.  And this brings us to scent.  If you like sweet, candy-like scents, Rock Star is amazing.  It's very sweet, very pink, and very girly.  Overall, this has a lovely candy scent (the same as Lush's Creamy Candy bubble bar).  It's a bit of a hard scent to explain, but very much sweet and candy-like.  

Overall, this is a lovely, luxurious soap.  It is also an expensive soap.  These are the main benefits/drawbacks.  I gave it 5 stars because I love the scent and texture"

""White linen"" is simply wonderful. Am I exaggerating?. I don't think so...

Truth to be told, I didn't buy it for myself: it was a gift. Notwithstanding that, I have gone on buying it ever since that lucky day in which I discovered it. Why?. Well, because I like it, and due to the fact that it goes well with my personality. I know, that seems a strange explanation, but it is the truth. 

This perfume isn't new, in fact EstÃ©e Lauder created it in 1978, coincidently the year in which I was born. All the same, who needs a new perfume, specially when there is a old one that works so well?. This one includes, among other fragances, citrus, peach, jasmine, lilac, rose and amber. The result is unique, and very pleasant.

On the whole, I can say I recommend ""White linen"" for those who can appreciate a subtle but special perfume. If you want more words to describe it, I suppose I will have to look them up in my dictionary. But I guess the best course of action would be trying a sample of ""White linen"": then you will have no doubts of what I am talking about  :)

So cute! That was a nice surprise and I didn't see them while I was taking a bath. I did see the little candy flowers floating about. 

This bath has a high ""cuteness"" factor and if you are in one of those ""everything has to be pink"" moods, then Think Pink may suit your candy mood. Lavender oil, Tonka absolute, vanilla and neroli oil makes this a calming bath that leaves you a little happier. You may enjoy this bath even more with the calming sweet ""Honey I Washed the Kids Sweet Honey Soap"" or the ""Sultana of Soap"" bar which is sumptuously smooth and leaves a fragrance on your skin that lasts all night. 

If you want a pink/vanilla soap, then you may want ""Rock Star."" If you are into mixing and matching according to scents, then the Trichomania is mildly scented with coconut and looks like a vanilla shampoo bar and it goes well with the vanilla scented American Cream conditioner. 

I vote for a tad more vanilla, although you can toss a little vanilla oil in the bath or some vanilla from the kitchen also works well. Eating sugar cookies in the tub is optional.

I've tried lots of over the counter products of various prices, and this is the first stuff I've used that works. However, (and this is a huge however) like most companies Philosophy assumes that acne prone skin is always oily skin. This is not so. My skin is very dry and sensitive, even in the areas where I am most likely to break out. I did notice when I bought the kit that it was likely to strip the oil from my skin, but I assumed that moisturizing would help with that. Not so. The acne cleared up nicely, but now I have a sizable (to me anyway) flaking patch next to one of my eyebrows.
I was using an aveno moisturizer after the h202 cream, and the blemish syrum only once a day (and that sparingly) but I am now going to try the Philosophy Hope in a Jar for Sensitive Skin and put it on after everything. Hopefully (no pun intended) this will help"

I found myself with bumps on my cheeks (where my skin was dry), around my nostrils (where my skin was super red and inflammed and raw looking), my nose (oily and prone to blackheads), and my forehead (also oily). I tried several high-end drugstore brands and none of them seemed to work. For months it was this way no matter what I did. I tried Proactiv, which dried my skin out horribly, and stung while I applied the products - I even used those products only every other day and my skin still peeled! I was all set to go to a dermatologist when I decided to give the Philosophy line a chance after hearing so many good things about it from family and friends. 

I've been using it religiously for two weeks, and while I can't say my skin is flawless, it's considerably improved. The bumps have gone down in every area, my nostrils are no longer red and unsightly, no more blackheads, and best of all it feels great while applying and after. Each product also has very little scent to it which I liked as well - no antiseptic smell here! I did find that the moisturizer wasn't quite enough for me so I started using Philosophy's Hope in a Jar for sensitive skin on my cheeks and neck. That and the fact that it cleared up my acne mostly but not completely are my reasons for giving it four stars rather than five.

Overall, I've very satisfied with the product and intend to continue using it for quite some time."

I've been using this kit for over a week, and I have definitely seen progress.  All of my existing blemishes cleared up much faster than usual, and I haven't seen any significant new breakouts.  

The only downfall is that this is a 4 step program which is a tad time consuming and tedious, but at this point I'm willing to do it if the results continue at this rate.  I also note that I need to put a top layer of moisturiser on my face as the protection creme doesn't do the trick to keep my skin from drying out in certain areas.  Which makes it actually a 5 step process.  

I've had short term success with other products in the past, so I'm only giving 4 stars for the good start. I am reserving judgement on the last star pending long-term results.  If the system continues to work for me I'll re-review"

Not only does the shade have to be great (not garish or sparkly) but I want it to smell pleasant (or not at all), taste pleasant (or not at all) and I want the case to feel substantial and click when I close it.

OK -- so how does this one measure up?  The shades are awsome.  I like Baby Lips and Natural Lips.  It smells ok -- kind of like vasaline -- but only faintly.  Estee Lauder lipstick has a much stronger perfume smell and Lacome tends to smell fruity.  It tastes faintly like a chapstick.  The case is relatively heavy and it clicks.  Neither the taste nor the smell are off-putting but because I'm so picky it only gets 4 stars.  (The texture is smooth as well and it doesn't feel heavy on your lips.)

If you want natural (not sparkly) lips for everyday this is a good choice"

The packaging is great.  It's fresh looking and pretty, but it's the fragrance itself that hooked me.  I got a few comments on it right away, so I think I'm going back to the store to buy some.  It might be a little too heavy for hot summer days, but perfect for winter.  I think this will definately suit cooler climates better, or if it's too hot, it will probably become sickly and too strong.  If you like the blend of fruit and floral, this is for you.

""Sheer"" is the operative word here - the makeup is subtle, refined and very flattering.

	The stick gloss rates a ten and all A's from me.  What's not to like about a lip treatment that soothes, smooths, plus adds color and fullness?  Stick gloss is a combination of lip balm, lip color, and lip glaze - a three in one winner.

	My favorite colors are Peony, a deep rose, and Poppy, a festive crimson.   When applied each color is much sheerer than the tube color indicates.  For instance, the Peony appears to be a burgundy tone yet on the lips it is a lovely rose.

     Perfect warm weather tones.

We use potions, creams, and masks on our faces to keep complexions glowing but often neglect our hair save for a quick shampoo and blow dry.  Then, all of a sudden, we look in a mirror and realize these tresses need a treatment! 

     Let's face it, blow drying, hot rollers, curling irons, coloring, the sun all take their toll on even the healthiest of heads.  

     Hair Mask with Shea Butter is both a treat and a treatment for dry, lifeless, lusterless hair.  Shea Butter is, of course, the key ingredient, working its magic to restore lackadaisical locks.  

      It's simple - work a palm size dollop through damp hair and leave on for up to 20 minutes.  Then shampoo and rinse hair well.  I'd also recommend using Fekkai's Apple Cider Clearing Rinse.

It has notes of peach, black currant, vanilla, and cedar.  

Please do not judge this scent by only sniffing the nozzle or smelling a scent strip of paper.  It smells NOTHING like it does on skin.  Allow it to settle for 5 minutes, and if it works with your body chemistry, you'll know right away. :o)  At first sprtiz, I get a peachy/cedar blast that quickly mellows into a gorgeous, clean, but warm scent.  The vanilla isn't sweet at all.. just warm and inviting.  I have received a lot of compliments on this.

The lasting power is wonderful!  By the end of the day, it can only be sniffed by anyone who gets close to you, but it has developed into a super soft, clean vanilla.  Burberry London can be expensive, but there are lots of places where you can find great deals on it.  The bottle is very sophisticated, simple, and classy.

While it is still a fantastic conditioner compared to most on the market, I really thought that the pink one did a better job.  Both leave my hair smooth and relatively healthy, but my hair is honestly gorgeous after using the pink Fekkai conditioner--shiny, bouncy, like I never colored it.  Maybe this one is a little too heavy for my hair?  I haven't quite figured out the difference.  

As previous posters have noted, this does have a rather strong smell--sort of a floral, almond fragrance--which is a little stronger than most hair products.  I didn't find it particually off-putting, but I do prefer the clean, simple fragrance of the pink Fekkai conditioner.

All in all, a great product, but I'll go back to my original Fekkai conditioner when this one runs out.

I have very dry, sensitive skin, and the little Evian spritzers (I carry one with me all the time in the winter) help immeasurably.  I spray a little on before moisturizing, or when my skin is flaking.  I always take these on planes--and spritz my face every two hours--and find that this keeps my skin from drying out and from becoming too oily (in reaction to the dryness) on long flights.

Some reviewers have scoffed at this product, pointing out that it's just water and speculating that the brand name is the draw.  I don't drink Evian water very often (I prefer other brands, if I'm drinking bottled water), and if I could find a comparable product I would definitely try it out.  Similar products, like the Body Shop face mists, tend to be scented and irritate my (very sensitive) skin (the exception to this is the face spritz from the Boots Botanical line, but that is hard to find outside of the UK); I've considered just getting a spray bottle and putting regular water in it, but those tend to have larger, more forceful sprayers and I don't want to point one at my face.

With the Evian brumisateur, you're getting just water, but that's all you need; it's conveniently packaged, lasts a long time for such a small bottle, and I love the way it feels.  Highly reccomended (and thank goodness they're carry-on approved, if you buy the small size!"

You'll Love This!,"October 23, 2006",Linda Vanator,"Long Valley, New Jersey USA","Don't be afraid of the word ""oil"". This treatment reversed years of damage from my color-treated very long hair after the first use. I love Philosophy products so when I heard about Shear Splendor I didn't hesitate and purchased the entire system. The shampoo and conditioner are the best things I have ever done for my hair. The effects are cumulative and after a few months of continued use, I'm still impressed. I use the Marinating Oil once a week and it's now a ""must have"" for me.  

The ""Marinating"" Oil is not what you might imagine an ""oil"" to be. It penetrates the hair, treats the scalp, smells really good (very subtle) and doesn't feel heavy. It's easy to leave in all night, washes out so quickly and it's instant gratification - beautiful hair. 

Leave it to a great skin care company to apply beneficial treatment properties to hair care.  

This Marinating Oil also multi-tasks for me. I use a tiny bit and rub it into my cuticles and nails.  I use a few drops to tame frizz before I use my flat-iron. I've rubbed a few drops onto my hands and feet when I've felt extra-dry.  This is good stuff!

I highly praise this product.  This is not just another random addition to the confusing mass of hair care lines.  This is serious *treatment* that won't be put on the shelf with the rest of the ""things I've tried"".

It's worth it. I actually love my hair again.  My color lasts longer, doesn't fade, and the shine just won't quit.  It's taken years and years of damage away.

I can blow-dry, flat-iron, curl... without the fry-factor.  

The shampoo and conditioner last forever. A little really does go a long, long way.

Thank you again Philosophy, you've yet to let me down."

Finally, for maxium efficacy, StriVectin-SD must be applied three times a day, every day for 4-6 weeks...StriVectin-SD works, but you have to use it. So unless you're committed to getting rid of stretch marks, don't waste your time, your energy, or your money."" 

After months of thinking about an incredibly large skin care purchase, I splurged and purchased the StriVectin-SD cream. If you have ever gained and lost weight or have been pregnant, then you know that you can get stretch marks and they never seem to go away. How do you heal your skin so they literally disappear? Well, to start with, you need a cream that will produce dramatic results in a short amount of time. Especially as summer is approaching. 

I gave this cream a one-month trial. You need very little because this cream is very concentrated. It seems to increase the skin's thickness and firmness, therefore making the depths of indented surfaces much less apparent. 

Results you should see in 4-6 weeks: 

Decrease in the actual length of the stretch mark 
Decrease in the depth of the indented surfaces 
Increase in skin smoothness, thickness and firmness 

What is actually occurring? 

The cream stimulates glycosaminoglycan and collagen synthesis. It will also correct irregularities in skin coloration. The Peptide solution helps to thicken the skin. 

How often did I apply this? 

Just one to two times a day. At first I tried to apply the cream three times a day, but found it was easier to remember to put this cream on after a shower and/or before bed. It seems to work very well with only two applications a day. 

You may also find yourself using this on your face or on areas where you want to see a decrease in wrinkles. 

Not for use by pregnant or nursing women. Consult with your dermatologist before using this product. Do ask your doctor if this product is right for you and start using it as soon as possible after pregnancy/nursing. You will be amazed at the results after 1 month. My main reason for using this product was due to weight gain and monthly weight gain. It seems to have been very effective and I will continue using the product over the long term for maintenance. 

The ingredient list is long (a proprietary combination of skin firming agents, elasticizers and hydrators) but some of the main ingredients include: Sesame oil, sweet almond oil, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3, Algae Extract, Coneflower Extract, Licorice, Cocoa Butter, Shea Butter, Mango Butter, Peppermint Oil and retinyl Palmitate. 

This product has been clinically proven to dramatically reduce stretch marks and you will find many additional uses for this product. Is it better than Botox? I have never used Botox, but I can say there was a definite reduction in facial wrinkles after a month of use on two main areas of my face. 

What else does this product promise? It will reduce acne scars, burn scars, chicken pox marks and scars from old injuries. If you are looking for even faster results, go to your local esthetician and have a microdermabrasion peel. That will help this product absorb better and you will see even faster results. 

I also just found the Derma E Peptides Plus Double-Action Wrinkle Reverse Creme. It also has the Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3 and is perfect for use on your face if you are allergic to nut oils like almond oil. Once you realize the benefits of this ingredient, you will start to recognize the name in many skin products. 

I would love to see them make this product in an oil-free formula for oily skin or at least a formula you could use all over your face if you have oily skin. Use sparingly and you shouldn't have a problem and it is great for areas of dry skin. 

I now enjoy using this product on my body and the Derma E Peptides Plus product on my face.

Well, the proof is in the pudding, so to speak. StriVectin WORKS. As I was much heavier at one point in my life, I had stretch marks to show for it. While they never really bothered me before, I thought I'd give it a try, with summer around the corner. I'm at just about 3 weeks of use and they are FADING. Literally. While they haven't vanished completely yet, I am quite happy with the results. They have drastically faded so far, and have lost that 'silvery' look of before. They recommend using this product up to 6 weeks and I plan on doing just that. Simple and easy. And guess what? You can even use this product on your face! They make the claim that it's ""Better than Botox"" and I would agree. Something you normally do, like putting on lotion is far healthier, simpler and saner. Although it doesn't bother me; the minty scent could bother some people on their face and hence they've released the non frangrant eye creme. LOVE this product"

The consistency of the gel is fairly thin (more like a liquid than a gel), which some reviewers have said they didn't like, but I actually prefer this type of shower gel, and wanted to point out that it is still a very saturated smell, and is not a ""watered down"" smell at all.

Actually, it was better than that - it swept over everything on my skin without depositing powder unevenly. That's rare for a brush. Usually you have to spend some time with a sponge or fingertips blending, but not with this.

The light cream powder, named the 4-in-1 foundation, provides excellent coverage without being thick.  (Thick powder base is terrible - it always looks like you dunked your face in a bowl of flour!) My freckles are still there, but my skintone is more even. This stuff is concealer, foundation, powder, and SPF protection. Awesome. So much easier than doing everything separately! And no oil, talc, alcohol, fragrance, chemical dyes, or preservatives, but what it does have is Vitamin E and Shea Butter. 

The Universal Marble Powder spreads into a tint that looks fairly natural - sun-kissed perhaps. It did need darkening with the darker powder - at least for me. But only a touch.

The Mineral Glow didn't go on as dark as it looked either. I was actually kind of surprised with this one - most dark powders end up everywhere if you try to shade them out...or impressively dark in one location if you don't. This wasn't like that at all, though I think I'd like a darker color for eyeshadow accents.

(They have updated/renamed this product a few times over the years but apparently only to add some new ingredients - the texture and effects are consistent and I believe better). 

I havent found another moisutrizer that has the same feel as this one- its light and easy to blend and lets your skin breathe so you don't feel ""coated"" in a thick film. I have found that it makes my makeup go on better and more evenly since its absorbs right into the skin and makes it smoother. It truly makes my otherwise dull skin glow! 

I can't really testify to the anti-wrinkle claims because I'm too young to have wrinkles and wear SPF 60 every time I leave the house, but hopefully its working! My only complaint is that it doesn't have a high SPF protection, but I think adding it would totally change the product and make it thicker, thereby negating all its wonderful attributes. Therefore, I HIGHLY recommend using it twice daily (or once if you prefer a different nighttime one) and adding a high SPF on top to prevent skin damage.  "

It leaves you with super soft feeling and ""pampered"" skin, and you can apply makeup rightaway.  As for the promised anti-wrinkle effect, I am not too sure. I think a great deal of the effect is a kind of temporary plumping or masking of wrinkles immediately after application which fades after a couple of hours, especially with makeup on.  But overall, I think it helps keep the skin somehow glowing and I am quite satisfied with this as a nice quality day and night cream for someone my age (slightly younger-looking 37).

There is nothing this mighty warrior cannot do when it comes to cleansing and purging the skin of clogged pores and dry patches. I don't suggest treating the face like a floor, scrubbing away until the polish wears off, but a good scrub at least once a week for normal to oily skin is not only beneficial but also very relaxing and let me just say that the scent itself makes me feel healthier all ready. I still get this, not only because of my fond memories but for it's ability to perk up and refresh my skin, especially before a mask on a Sunday night right before bed. I love the fresh piney scent of the scrub and its creamy consistency marred with real ground tea leaves.

Tea Tree is found in parts of South East Asia, New Zealand and Australia. The small shrub can survive in places where other vegetation fails to flourish. There are over a hundred eighty species of tea tree, only the oil steam-distilled from the single species of Melaleuca alternifolia is used commercially and it's only found in Northern New South Wales. Since it's discovery the oil has been called a first aid kit in a bottle, not used a moisturizer but as a deep cleanser and antiseptic it's also used to treat pimples, burns, stings, toot aches, gum infections and various other unpleasant occurrences.

Without cleansing and scrubs, skin would take twenty five days to wear off, not to mention the daily doses of makeup, pollution, smoke, mixture of sebum and dead skin, dust, dirt that collect on top, they trap the healthy layers and promote patches of redness and irritation, not to mention breakouts and an unhealthy environment for one part of our bodies that represents us so well is definitely a bad idea. Scrubs such as the tea tree oil one are not only natural but also gentle enough not to harm and over strip the skin when used accordingly to the skin type of the user. To get the most of the scrub, a quick steam bath is also very nice; I cover my head with a clean towel and lean over a bowl of hot water with some chamomile tea in it for five minutes. I don't put my face too close to avoid getting my skin burned but it's very relaxing and a great pore opener before the scrub and a mask.

People keep saying that you can cut a bubble bar in half and get plenty of bubbles, but I felt indulgent and I used the entire thing. I don't think I've ever seen so many bubbles in one bath! They stayed until the end. The smell was deliciously sweet, and the water was so soft and silky that afterwards I shaved with no shaving cream or anything. 

This may sound silly, but if someone ever made a bed as soft as those bubbles, I'd want one. I was playing with them, kind of patting them between my hands (which didn't pop them), and I just could not get over how soft they were.

When the water got cold, I just turned the faucet back on and added more hot water. Three times. I had so much trouble dragging myself out of that tub that I thought someone was going to have to come in after me!

I still smell like candy several hours later. I even conditioned my hair with a totally different scent, and my hair definitely smells like the bubble bath.

Horton ""girasolflor""",,"If at first you don't succeed...play around until you get a better result- different approaches seem to work for individual Lush users.  Like most Lush products, Ocean Salt Scrub may take a little getting used to (and may behave differently depending on what type of water you have) but it is lots of fun to play with and delivers a good result.  Probably not for people who want a streamlined beauty routine that can be accomplished fast, but if you like to play... The scrub smells and looks amazing and the vodka/citrus combination definitely helps dry up blemishes.  I have sensitive skin and this has been helpful with once a week usage- any more than that and my skin gets tight and irritated and begins to flake.

One final note of caution: this scrub is serious when it says 'salt', so don't use it on or near broken skin.  Bath & Body Works started using sugar in their scrubs for this reason, but salt has a great effect on clearing up problem skin and tends to help where things aren't seriously broken"

If you are contemplating purchasing any Lush product, I say go for it. I have been a Lushie for about 3-4 years now (since my trip to the UK), and I have very rarely been disappointed in their products. Be aware that all internet purchases for Lush are shipped from their manufacturing facility in Vancouver, so unless you are willing to pay a bit for expedited shipping, expect a long wait time for delivery.

So after seeing it at Sephora I just had to buy it and test out my memory.  OMG it's just like how I remember it! With just a couple strokes of the wand my lashes are *instantly* lengthened and curled -- it's wonderful! Especially since I have STICK-STRAIGHT lashes that you can't even see unless I have mascara on (it's so irritating -_-;;).  

I think my favorite part about this mascara is that not only do you see my lashes but you see my whole eyes! They really pop with this mascara on, which is quite relieving considering I was told that it wouldn't help me unless I curled my lashes beforehand with an eyelash curler.  I'm sure pre-curling would instensify my look, but I honestly don't think it's necessary.  Besides, I like how natural my lashes look with this mascara on -- it really tricks you into believing that you were born with naturally beautiful lashes... it's so subtle yet defined!

I would HIGHLY recommend this mascara to any girl who needs an ""uplift"" with their lashes"

They also only seem to serve one purpose, drying out your skin or removing oil. There are some that leave your face feeling nourished and this is one of the healing clay masks. I have sensitive skin with a tendancy towards being either dry or oily - guess it is that lovely combination skin problem. So, this mask seems to deal with both issues at once - removing dry skin and deeply cleansing the pores. 

Mask of Magnaminty is made with Bentonite, water, kaolin, honey, Phaseolus Angularis Seed powder, Evening Primrose seeds, peppermint oil, flower extracts, vanilla fruit extract and a chlorphyllin-Copper complex. 

This is fun to use in the bath or in the shower while you are shaving. Put it on for a few minutes, let it dry slightly and then rub off dead skin cells. The seeds provide the exfoliating power. 

Almost immediately upon looking in the mirror after leaving the tub, I could tell this mask had healing powers. Along with Dreamwash, my skin looked especially cleansed and calmed. I can recommend both to you if you have a need for skin brightening and calming. These two products seemed to work well together to create a radiant complexion. You may also want to try Prince Shaving Cream and the Dream On bath bomb. The Figs and Leaves soap is also very moisturizing. 

~The Rebecca Review 

P.S. If you can find someone to rub this all over your back, 
it feels so good and is easy to wash off by yourself later (unlike some clay masks I've tried). "

I use a variety of masks on a weekly basis and sometimes they are too strong on my skin.

When I opened the pot, the first thing I noticed was the color - it is a little turn-offish, but don't let that stop you from slathering your entire face with it.  The smell is amazing and not too minty or strong.  Like the previous review said below, it smells like mint chocolate chip ice cream.  I put the mask all over my face (you can put it on your neck and back as well), lie down for 15 minutes to get the full spa feel, then wash it off in the shower with warm water.  I find it is much easier in the shower because when the mask dries, it takes some rubbing to get it off.

When the mask is on, your face tingles from the mint and feels so refreshing!  When the mask is rinsed off, your skin feels even better.  Great cleanser and exfoliator in one!

The hand woven Abaca bag creates a little mystery because you can't quite see all the treats in the bag. What you will find when you open this luxurious Burt's Bees sampler bag is the following surprises: 

A Lavender Mask - Blocks out all the light so you can relax. A delicate and very natural lavender fragrance is subtly relaxing and not overpowering. The silk is quite luxurious and this is a comforting item that will last for years. 

Burt's Bees Pore Refining Mask - Ingredients (they have changed the ingredients to make it work even better than before): French green clay, bentonite, fragrance, peppermint leaf, shavegrass herb, calendula, rosemary leaf and sage. This mask is a lovely avocado green and will make you feel more calm. I loved how the powder can also be mixed with my favorite moisture mask or with natural ingredients for variety. 
I've rarely seen a product clean pores this well. You can simply pour some of the green powder into your hand and mix in a little water. After applying, let dry and then rinse. 

Burt's Bees Royal Jelly Eye CrÃ¨me - A rich eye crÃ¨me that is more like the consistency of a salve. You may be tempted to use this on hands and feet for a little healing luxury. The ingredients are delicious and include apricot kernel oil, aloe, grapefruit extract, royal jelly and vitamin E. Tempting to use as a lip gloss. 

Burt's Bees Moisturizing Herbal Milk Bath - If you were addicted to the Burt's Bees Baby Buttermilk bath, this is a nice grownup alternative. It contains milk powder, buttermilk powder, lavender oil, eucalyptus oil, rosemary oil and peppermint oil. Very relaxing and you may find yourself reading a little longer as you soak away your cares. You may notice your skin being especially healed and moisturized. 

Burt's Bees Calm Balm - A yummy lemon balm made from sweet almond oil, olive oil, beeswax, lemon oil, vitamin E, comfrey root extract, rosemary leaf, lavender, lemongrass oil and lemon verbena. You may start to imagine you are very close to a lemon meringue pie and wonder if you should probably make one. A delicious relaxing scent of lemony bliss. 

Burt's Bees Calming Candle - The tiny candle in this kit is super relaxing and can take you from stressed out to especially calm in a matter of minutes. I tried this candle when I was stressed and it definitely works. Would be a wonderful item to take with you when traveling as it has a lid. 

Burt's Bees Repair Serum - This product supports skin repair and renewal and works to reduce fine lines and wrinkles. Borage and Evening Primrose oils help to promote healthy skin. The oils absorb quickly and soothe and heal the skin. Ingredients: Rosehip seed oil, jojoba oil, lavender oil, vitamin E, evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, wheat germ oil, hazelnut oil, neroli oil, rose oil, calendula extract, green tea extract, beta carotene, tocopherol, vitamin C, vitamin A.

Burt's Bees Shea Butter Hand Repair CrÃ¨me - A luxurious blend of shea butter and cocoa butter, not to mention lavender, calendula, rose oil and rosemary. Not only will this heal and soothe your skin, it is emotionally calming and beautifully scented. 

As a gift, this is filled with healing ingredients that will create a very memorable experience. If you want to sample some of the best of Burt's Bees, it is also an ideal introduction to the world of natural skincare.

After I wash my face and put on my lotion, I put this all over my face (all you need is a little more than a pea, maybe about the amt of toothpaste you'd use).  The key is to WAIT 2 MINUTES!  The first time I used it, I didn't wait, plus I think I used too much, and my makeup went on cakey and wouldn't spread.  So now, after I put it on, I put on my eye makeup while I'm waiting.  Also, I used to use Neutrogena liquid foundation (as I need GOOD coverage), but I didn't have much luck with liquid foundation over The Present, even after waiting 2 minutes.  I bought Philosophy's The Supernatural powder foundation, and it goes over The Present soooo well.  I didn't think a powder foundation would cover my acne well enough, but it does!  Both products together are a little pricey for me, but since I use them EVERY day, it's worth it.
Oh and I have very sensitive skin, hence all the breakouts, but The Present doesn't affect me.
The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I never tried another primer, and there may be something better out there, but I'm in no rush to search.  The Present works well for me"

Fine lines and large pores appear less noticable, skin remains shine-free, skin tone appears more even and skin feels softer.

One recommendation.....the directions tell you to wait 2 minutes to allow the product to 'set'.  To get the best finish, especially if applying powder (like I do) or foundation over the primer, you need to wait the full 2 minutes.  This can't be stressed enough."

I took ""the present"" back to the makeup counter where they told me to use an amount equal to the size of half of a pea - for my ENTIRE face!  I was doubtful, but spreading it super-thin worked, plus each bottle lasts a long, long time.

Here are my favorite things about this product:
-Foundation glides on supersmooth
-Fine wrinkles are less visible
-Makeup stays put all day long
-Keeps oily skin shine-free
-Works great as an eyeshadow base to keep it from creasing
-Makes skin feel soft

The one downside is if I don't wash my face at night, I break out, probably because it really is like a ""sealant"" for your face.  Other than that, I love it, and will probably never switch to another base."

She suggested this, and for forty-five dollars, I was leery.  It was a dewy finish, she said (dewy didn't interest me), and it didn't have a lot of pink in it.

I let her try it on me, but I have bought so many foundations over the years where I get home and it either doesn't look the same as it did in the store or I don't apply it the way they do in the store.

This makeup was different.  Very nice for my dry skin, the dewiness of which the sales assistant spoke actually doesn't leave a shiny, greasy finish.

I have a secret to tell you. I tried the shampoo you recommended, but don't tell anyone else because if the word gets out on this one, there won't be any shampoo left for the two of us. The lemon oil really did make my hair feel frisky and with the papaya juice, not a single strand felt the weight of hairspray buildup. Thank you for showing the way to silky clean hair. I felt like a kid again who was running around in a lemon orchard, my hair loves this shampoo. As an added bonus, it also lightened my Lush henna experience, just slightly, so now I have the perfect hair color.

P.S. 
Try the Veganese conditioner with this shampoo because it also has a lemony scent and seems to be a nice lightweight conditioner. 

P.S. II 
While you are doing the citrus thing in the shower, why not try the Happy Hippy body gel with grapefruit too. I think it really does balance your aura. I feel cleansed. "

'Chocolovers' is the darker, sexier, naughty but nice sister of the sugary 'Pink Sugar'. Sort of like Dannii Minogue to Kylie.

Not as sweet as 'Pink Sugar', when first applied I got the rich aroma of the lemon and orange, combined with coriander, preventing it from being zesty. I could also smell roasted nuts.

This is a natural facial repair serum from Burt's Bees, and it is excellent for this use.  However, I rarely use it on my face, except at night sometimes, because it is so intense and heavy.  The rest of the time I use it EVERYWHERE else!  I mix it with my overall body moisturizer (which is pure sesame oil) and rub it all over my body.  I use it full strength on my hands.  I use it anywhere on my body that needs attention, healing, moisture.  For special occasions, I use it as an all-over body moisturizer full strength.

I go through probably a bottle a month, so it is ""expensive"", but I enjoy it so much I don't care.  A little goes a long way, but I am using it for so many things. 

The smell is probably my favorite small of any ""beauty"" product.  It is an aromatherapy-type smell, earthy, not perfume-y at all. All of the oils are natural, and blend together to create a perfect lovely fragrance.  It is subtle, but unlike anything else I've tried.

The ingredients are: Rosehip seed oil, jojoba oil, lavender oil, tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E), evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, wheat germ oil, hazelnut oil, neroli oil, rose oil, calendula extract, green tea extract, beta carotene, tocopherol, ascorbyl palmitate (vitamin C), retinyl palmitate (vitamin A).  They are all natural and wonderful!

I like the bottle size too, as it is easy to travel with. At the price, I consider Burt's Bees Repair Serum an affordable luxury that I can't do without!

You can get a very good shave without any nicks or cuts if you use proper technique.  Consult the ""Art of Shaving"" for how to prepare your face.  With this razor you should use short strokes and do not apply extra pressure.  Allow the weight of the razor to to do the work, a couple of light strokes is better than one heavy stroke and is much less likely to cut your face.  After shaving with the grain you can re-lather and shave against the grain if desired.  This razor allows you to have more control over your shave, but requires more effort from the user than cartridge razors.  For instance, a cartridge razor will pivot to adjust to your face to some extent.  A safety razor is fixed and therefore you have to change the angle of the blade (by raising or lowering the razor's handle in relation to your face) to accomodate the undulations of your face.  This is less of a pain than it may sound, after you use the razor for a week or two it will become second nature.  I have used it for about two week and have not cut my face since the second shave.  If you follow this technique and keep your face properly lathered you will enjoy a nick free and comfortable shave.

One more thing, you will need to experiment with the ""closeness"" setting of the razor to find what is best for you.  Start with the lowest setting and increase it if necessary. "

With a Safety razor like Merkur's my face gets an easy shave that is smoother than any razor I've used before. My fiance agrees as well. The only problem is that I do take much longer to shave now than I did before.

The small amount of product it takes to make a mass of lather is incredible.  Which is nice because you won't go through the bottle that quickly.  It did a great job of gently cleansing my hair without making it feel like straw afterwards.  Now the scent...  Utterly addictive!  Now I'm not a big fan of mint smells,  but the way this was blended with the other scents is amazing.  You can definitely smell the mint, but it's not by any means overpowering.  Mixed in with the mint is a wonderful fruit scent,  that literally smells ""juicy"".  In the background, very lightly is a touch of herbal.  I happen to HATE anything herbal,  so I was surprised that I even liked this.  The smell is very unique and delicious!

Ok,  all that being said though - it did just as good a job as most any other Lush shampoos (including some of the solids).  I also use their Trichomania and Big and they do the same kind of lovely job Rehab does.  The price just kills me.  I know that real oils, juices and herbs are used, but unfortunately I can't afford to make this item a staple.  Still,  if you don't have a problem with the price,  definitely pick up a bottle (start with the smallest size though!) and give it a try."

LUSH has done it again.  Another great product that is safe (no chemicals, all natural prodcuts) and actually works better then name brand items.  Rehab Shampoo smells great, a really nice citrus smell, and is perfect for damaged (or not) hair.  My hair isn't damaged that much, but I found Rehab to be a great preventative shampoo also.  Washes out very clean and when followed with Retread or American Cream, my hair has never been better.

Like the other review said, LUSH products take some time getting used to because they don't use chemicalls to make your hair 'feel' soft.  They actually use ingredients that help the damage, rather than hide it.  Please keep that in mind when you try their products.  Give it some time before you make a final discision"

Recently, I have noticed that my ""good old"" Matrix shampoo has left my naturally wavy hair limp and dull. I read about Lush solid shampoo in Lucky magazine, and thought I'd give it a try. I ordered Seanick through their website.

The box arrived today, and I eagerly ripped it open. Seanick arrived wrapped in tissue paper and I could already smell it. It smelled great, not girly, but like the ocean. I was so taken by this that I hopped in the shower to try it out. The bar itself is just like the picture shows--bright blue and studded with seaweed. I could see how some people wouldn't like the ""plants in my hair"" aspect, but I like it. The bar lathered up quickly with lots of bubbles. I actually kind of had fun washing my hair for once. I put a little conditioner on as well, about half of what I normally use. As I towel-dried my hair, it actually squeaked. Pretty clean!

As my hair dried, it was nice and fluffy. Believe it or not, it was actually curlier and my sister said it was a little lighter. All good things. I use a lot of product in my hair, so maybe it cleaned all that off. Anyway, my hair feels silky, shiny, and soft. I even used it as a body soap! What a nerd... 

I love the whole idea behind a solid shampoo and think it would be great to travel with. I highly recommend this to anyone, especially if you have limp and boring hair. My only complaint is that the awesome smell doesn't last.."

This shampoo was wonderful.  Only needed three strokes of the bar down my below-the-shoulder length hair and my hair lathered up really nicely.  Just be sure to keep this shampoo bar (as with all the shampoo bars) out of water when you aren't using it or it will turn into mush.

Took off a star because a traditional bottled shampoo is much easier and convinient to work with and store.  Really nice take with you on trips, though.  If you want a shampoo and conditioner bar, try Hybrid or Godiva"

From specialty stores to prescription items - I've found a few that do work somewhat.  I depend on conditioners to be the most important product in my hair regime because the conditioner you use has the greatest impact on how your hair turns out that day....trust me - I know.  I've got this hair product thing down to a science.  I used the two Lush products this morning: Big Shampoo and Retread.  Holy **** - what a difference.  I am so happy right now - you should see how good my hair looks today - I used this for the first time this morning and here are some of the key points:

1.  You only have to use a very little bit (I have hair past my shoulders and I only used about 2 teaspoons).

2.  The product smells like Heaven. It's got that affluent expensive natural smell - not that perfumey dimestore smell. 

3.  The frangrance lingers on and on - I've had GUYS tell me how good I smell.

4.  After using with the other product ""Big Shampoo (or Hair)"" - my hair was thick, soft, shiny, silky, with lots of movement - no static. 

5. This conditioner gives me the perfect moisture balance (for my hair anyway - I have very thin, fine, dry hair).

As far as lush overall:

Let me first state that I am in no way affiliated with Lush - I placed an order for over $100 worth of Lush products and this was one of the products in the order. The only negative thing was the shipping turnaround (little over 3 weeks) but when my Lush items came in - I didn't care. The scent of all the products is gorgeous!!! It's made with all natural products that actually smell awesome and last throughout the day. Not too perfumey at all but definitely recognizable to others. I had guys commenting all day on how good I smell!!!!! The packaging is delightful, the product presentation is adorable, and the quality is better than I've EVER experienced. Better than Benefit, better than Philosophy, etc. I buy and try just about every new product line that comes out - some I like some I don't. I can tell you that this line is my new favorite! I'm going to stock up on everything they have because not only do the products work, they are so pretty to look at that I will use them as decorations in my bathroom!!!

Customer service is extremely responsive and doesn't reply with form letters to your concerns and questions. They said they are working to improve their shipping times and were very accomodating. They also gave me some nice coupons with my order!

After use my skin actually has an imrpoved texture and a ""life"" that seemed lacking in the past. Daily use has made a marked difference. Granted, it is not a minor investment, but it just takes a little for comfortable coverage. My guess is this jar will last me many moons!

This cream may be best in the summer months as it is not overly rich once applied. It will work well when you are putting on lighter fabrics like silk or anything where a rich body cream would be a disaster. The secret of this formula seems to be the sesame seed oil and cocoa butter. 

There is something powdery soft about this body cream. It has a ""whispery don't tell"" quality and seems to secretly sink into your skin, leaving only the most delicate hint of sweet cinnamon and faraway ocean breezes. 

The Bathina cream is much more seductive than the body wash, although the two work very well together. You may be amazed at how soft this makes your skin and the scent is delicate enough to allow for the layering of your favorite perfume. I'd recommend the Anna Sui ""Sui Love"" perfume because it seems to have hints of the same whispery floral beauty. 

The small ""to go"" size is probably good for two or three applications. I almost used half the container the first time. I'd go with the larger size even if you are buying the small body wash. I like using the body wash for bubble bath but it would also work well if you are going away for the weekend.

I have tried everything, lots of stuff isn't worth 2 cents and then there's Clinique Pore Refining Lotion. This is a must in my daily routine, I even wear it when I am sleeping. How to use: Wash face, then apply after any serums that you may use, but before moisturizer with sunscreen, primer, concealor or foundation. DO NOT PUT TOO MUCH ON if you are planning on layering makeup on top of it, as it will make your makeup flake off your skin. This is not something that you would smear all over, only on your oily areas (such as nose, chin etc). If you use it on your dry areas, it will make your face look to dry. Nobody wants face dandruff on their black turtleneck. WHAT IT DOES: makes your face appear less oily, reduces the size of pores slightly the first few times you use it, but the pores will get smaller if you use it everyday. It also feels pretty nice when you rub it on (warm and tingly). It does contain salicyclic acid, so it prevents pores from clogging. The size of the tube is huge, it will at least a month or two with daily use. I think this works better than any clean-and-clear product, better than biore pore strips, thus the more expensive price. The only bad thing about this product is that it may dry out your skin if you use it too much and cause flaky skin. One of the other benefits is that it will reduce the amount of oil that your skin produces throughout the day, thus you won't have to blot or powder pat as much as normal"

After ten minutes in a regular towel turban, my hair still drips profusely.  After ten minutes in the Aquis towel, the outer surface of my hair is almost dry to the touch!  Not to mention that the towel holds in a turban perfectly - normal towels are so heavy that I must keep my head upright to keep the turban in place.  With the Aquis, I can bend over or swing my head around and the turban does not come undone or fall off.  I don't like to use hair dryers because it is extremely damaging to your hair; with the Acquis, there's less need to because my hair is half dry after a few minutes in it.  Also, I've noticed that my hair has a lot more volume when I dry it with the Aquis.  I could see how people with thin or very short hair would not get the full benefit of this towel because a normal towel works well enough for them; but if you have a lot of hair, this towel is just like magic"

Not with Phytodefrisant!,"July 9, 2006","claresmom ""claresmom""","Wynnewood, PA","This is my ""Holy Grail"" haircare product -- I could use almost any other shampoo, almost any other conditioner, almost any other hairspray, but I could *not* ever use any other styling product on my hair, now that I've had a chance to use this. There is a Very Good Reason why Phytotherathie's Phytodefrisant has long been a mainstay of top professional models & has been voted the #1 haircare product by readers of ""Allure"" magazine more than once -- try it & if you have frizzy hair I guarantee you'll understand, too.

My hair is thick, naturally wavy/curly & prone to extreme frizziness in the slightest humidity, & I've spent most of my post-pubescent life trying to figure out how to straighten it & control the frizziness. Until I discovered Phytodefrisant, the most effective product I had found was Sebastian's ""Laminates"" (I've tried virtually *every* product promoted to control frizziness that's been on the U.S. market in the last 30 years), but the silicone eventually built up on my hair & on very humid days I had to use so much of it that my hair was weighed down by the coating & felt ""dirty"". It ""looked"" reasonably good (for most of the day), but it certainly didn't feel very good to the touch. However, letting my hair go ""curly"" was a non-starter because the ""curls"" became nothing but frizz unless the humidity was close to 100% & if I used the ""Laminates,"" it only destroyed my hair's ability to curl & simply made my hair look ""dirty"" & unstyled.

By contrast, just a teaspoon of Phytodefrisant allows me to blow-dry my hair to soft, sleek, straight smoothness, with no residue detectible at all to the touch. The first time I used it, what struck me the most was how ""natural"" & ""bouncy"" my hair felt to the touch (I know, I know, I sound like a TV commercial, but this is *really* true!). I could run my fingers through my smooth, straight hair without detecting the slightest residue of the product & even after a month of daily use there is absolutely *no* build up whatsoever. On days when I want to wear my hair ""curly"", a single teaspoon allows my hair to dry naturally into crisp, bouncy curls without the slightest evidence of frizziness all day, no matter the humidity.

My hair is shoulder-length & this tube lasts me for about 6 months, which breaks down to a cost of 13 cents a day. If buying a tube for this price seems daunting, Phyto includes a small travel-size tube in its ""Petites"" travel collection, which would allow you to try a variety of their products & which is also sold here at Amazon.com last time I checked.

I have had 2 X-boyfriends, that I am still friends with, tell me they have never forgotten the smell of my perfume.  One of these guys dates back to college and I have been outta there for 8 years now.  I broke down and told them the name of  "" that smell they loved"" because they want to buy it for their new significant others.  The scent made an incredible impression on me,  but apparently on the other people that have been in my life as well. The scent is dark, seductive, and delicate at the same time.  I notice the scent changes more as the day wears on which I love because it only gets better.  I am told this is called the dry down phase.  Of course I am no professional perfumer,  but out of my collection of scents,  this one is my Annie Hall.... beautiful but different..  and not to be missed. "

I just cant live without it actually. I had tried with failure, alot of different moisturizers on the market over the years, wasting a ton of money on what I would say is basically false advertising of products that are mostly water and wax based, and was given this butter a few years ago by a friend and have been ordering it ever since. It pays for itself with the first use, and is not only excellent for dry hands but legs and well, just about anywhere you want healed, soft real skin again. I use it on my cuticles after manicures and have instant results there too! I totally recommend it to anyone who just cant get their dry skin to heal and be truly soft. Its not to heavy for summer use either, its just perfect"

On the first spay you notice the top notes of magnolia and lotus flower, then the dreamy base of vanilla-infused musk, which lasts throughout the day. The best surprise of all?   After you've worn it for a few hours, you are surprised with the mouth-watering aroma of tangy pear. "

MAC StudioFix Powder is one of my favorite products, as it is a light-weight product with light to medium coverage that I use on top of heavier coverage foundations to provide a matte finish and a tiny bit of extra coverage. 

One of my favorite features is the fact that there is such a wide selection of shades to match virtually any skintone. As recommended on Asianbeautyblog.com for my Asian skintone, I can use C35 and NC35 pretty interchangably - both are yellow based shades, though I find that C35 is more natural looking when used alone because of its golden/olive undertones. There are few other companies that offer such a wide range of shades, especially ones that suit ethnic skintones. I love MAC"

","January 27, 2006","Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","Kenner, LA USA","Instead of indulging in one of those fabulously aromatic concoctions of sugar, cinnamon, flour and white frosting hawked in every airport food court in the country, buy yourself a jar of this whipped body soufflÃ© that accurately mimics the irresistibility of the smell without the worry of all those extra calories or the concern that your friends may think that too much overtime has been accrued rolling out dough at the bakery.

This light emulsion goes on smooth, sinks into the skin within seconds, leaves none of the stickiness attributed to the real deal and converts into an actual perfume with cinnamon notes. Rather than doling out an overdose of cinnamon bun hot from the oven, the initial scent morphs to something light but lingering -- not cloying---you will be soft and feel as delicious and delectable as you smell. 

As I am tempted to apply it more than once a day, my only complaint may be that the jar is too small and will not last as long as I would like.

Nevertheless, Philosophy has come up with a calorie free treat that allows you to have your cake without eating it. 

Recommended to all those who like a fresh light scent that generates a warm feeling of yum.  Not recommended to those who may have extremely sensitive skin as one user that I know complained of a slight rash that appeared after using it on the skin under her arms"

This is the product to reach for in the dryness of winter when you are looking for just about anything to calm your scalp and keep in the moisture. The surprising aspect of this conditioning product is how deeply cleansed and nourished your scalp will feel. It also deeply moisturizes your hair like a conditioning treatment. 

One thing about this product is that it is super rich and it may take as many as four shampoos to get this out of your hair. I'd suggest trying this at night in the bath, washing it out twice and then putting your hair up for the night. That way, you don't have to worry about it until the next time you wash your hair the following day. I think of this as a sort of overnight treatment, even though I wash it out right after using it. 

This can be used as a preventative treatment once a week. Almond oil, nettle extract, rosemary, beeswax, papaya, menthol, peppermint, lavender, rose, juniper, salicylic acid make this a winner. I'll be ordering this one again!

After the last two brands I used cancelled my foundation shade I finally broke down and decided I would just have to go with a more expenssive foundation.  I sales clerk at Sephora recomended Vincet Longo to me as the best foundation they carry and I am so glad she did.  I use golden porcelin if I have been in the sun lately and porcelin if I have not.  The coverage is on the sheer side, so it is not heavey or cakey.  Because it is a little bit sheer you could probably wear a shade that is not an exact match and not have that mask look.  Most people can't tell when I am wearing this foundation and when I'm not.  Usually if anyone comments on my skin while I am wearing it it is to complement my skin and ask what cleansers and lotions I have been using. In my oppinion that is the reaction a good foundation should get.  I also love that that it is SPF 15, because as fair as I am my face burns pretty easily.  The dew finish is not shiney like some some dew finishes, just not matte.  Plus it contains ceramide 3, chamomile, vitamins E and C, all of which are supposed to sooth skin, protect it and improve texture.  I was not looking for a water proof foundation, and I have not tried it while swimming so I don't know if it stays on.  I will definatly be buying more Vincent Longo products.

The only problem I have with it and it's a very minor problem is that when I put it on, no matter how careful I am I always blink and it gets on my skin (lower lid).  It also has a tendency to drop a few dust flakes which I need to remove with a q-tip.  It's true you can go swimming in it because it is not waterproof, but for everyday it's the best."

	The Eye Sheens come in four different shades which you can either apply simply to the corner of your eyes or smudge all over the lid.  Try ""Big Thicket"" for an innocent lavender, or ""Loaded"" for a full throttle jade.  ""Platinum"" is a sheer sliver of silver, and ""Trust Fund"" a super sapphire.

With the Clinique compact, it's quick and totally natural looking with great coverage.  I use the sponge in the areas where I need a little bit more coverage and then use a brush for the rest of my face.  It's really great.  My face doesnt look like makeup is caked on.  
But WARNING; if you DO NOT know your color, I recommend going to a couple different department stores and getting consultations about the perfect color for your skin.  When I went to find the color of my compact, I got recommendations ranging from 104 to 116. Some workers really don't know what they're talking about. I ended up buying 106 and this one worker recommended 116, which is a HUGE difference.

The House of Creed quickly became a favorite among the English Court and Queen Victoria appointed the House of Creed the official perfume supplier. The House of Creed also became popular with other royals too!

Alright, so Himalya was created for men. I'm a woman and have  fallen in love with this classic scent and enjoy wearing it myself. Himalaya is one of my personal favorites made by the House of Creed (however I'm pretty partial too all the scents created for both men & women by the House of Creed). 

According to the descriptions I've found, Himalaya is a blend of mandarin, grapefruit, sandalwood, cedarwood, amber, pepper and tonka musk. I feel Himalaya has a rich, smooth, classic scent that will never go out of style. This fragrance is concentrated, so a little goes a long way and the scent lasts a long time without having to be re-applied. I have received plenty of compliments on this fragrance when I've worn it"

Secondly, the actual gloss is pretty good. However, that's also the reason why I only gave it four stars. The gloss doesn't last that long, and certainly doesn't taste that good. It isn't extremely shiny, however it is pretty moisturizing.

All in all, I recomend this as a cute gift topper or stocking stuffer for anyone who wears lip gloss or cute rings like this. I personally think it's worth it just for the container, but the actual gloss is nothing to write home about"

Here's a tip: I used first aid tape (the fabric kind, not the kind with really sticky adhesive) and I taped the stencil onto my brow. It took a little maneuvering to position the stencil at just the right place, but I taped the stencil down and brushed the powder on. Then I did the other eye. I  recommend using the stencils on both sides first and then doing the plucking, because I tried plucking right after removing the stencil on the first side, and I actually overplucked a tiny bit. (I was able to mask the almost indetectable difference in the two sides this morning when I put my makeup on by using just a teeny bit of the brown powder and the wax...I live in Texas and even in the humidity the powder stayed put and did not smudge!) Overall, this is not a snap to use, but definitely worth the effort, and I even got compliments on my brows from my coworkers who thought I had had them done professionally.

I had bought her tweezers a month before and could not stop raving about how great there were compared to my tweezermans. So, her signature eyebrows color had to be just as good or at least almost as good as the real thing (Anastasia, herself). The Stencils were intimidating at first, I had to take a deep breath before plucking the hair outside the stencil outline. But once I was done, my eyebrows looked great!

It's a little awkward using the stencils, but I managed fine.  Try them all out- the first three were never going to work on me, the last one I tried was a near perfect fit.  

I love the finished look- I didn't have a lot to pluck, but now my eyebrows look much neater.  My hair grayed very early in life, and now my stupid brows have gray and white hairs running through them- the powder covers that up nicely.  I didn't realize how aging my brows were to my face till I used this!

My only gripe is there is very little information with the kit- just minimal instructions on the back of the small box.  The website had a little more detail, and a few photos.  I could find no help with color choice- for the high price, I would hate to goof and get the wrong coloring for my skin type.  I am glad I went with the blonde"

The smell, of course, is grand - if you've smelled other karma-scented products from Lush, you'll know this. It's a unisex kind of scent, so I have to fight over it with my husband when we travel. MUCH better than those little bottles of foul-smelling shampoo and bath gel you get at most hotels. The earthy, citrusy smell of lemongrass, orange, lavendar, and pine is a wonderful way to wake up in the morning.

If you go to a Lush store, you can usually get a free tin to store your shampoo bars in if you buy 2 bars"

I started using this a couple of days ago and I've noticed a positive difference in my hair. My hair wasn't a total mess using silicone shampoos, but now that I've changed brands I can see the potential my hair had and I didn't even know it. 

I have shoulder length really thick hair with a few waves and curls. I don't have too much of a problem with tangling to begin with. All I needed was a couple of swipes down my hair and this will lather right up. It smells awesome in the shower. Lush describes it as oranges in a bowl of spices; I'm not so sure about that but it definately smells kind of foresty and nice. It rinsed off very well with hot water and I followed with Jungle conditioner. 

Hours later in the day I can stil smell Komba shampoo wafting around my head. It's amazing. I've never had a shampoo stick with me like this and my hair feels light and shiny and just clean. No matter how much I try to clean regular shampoo from my hair it seems to weigh it down. My boyfriend mentioned today my hair looked much less ""poofy"". This is just amazing. 

I would reccomend keeping the shampoo in an airtight container. Keeping it on a shelf where any water will hit it will deteriorate its longevity. I keep mine in a very tiny tupperwear container in the shower. The size of the bar is small, but it will go a loooooong way."

I read good reviews about this product, so I decided to give it a try.  It amazed me!  My hair really doesn't have much natural wave- maybe one or two semi-waves in the back.  Frankly, if I leave my hair air-dry without doing anything to it, it looks like cave-woman hair!  But not with this stuff!  I towel dried my hair until it was just damp.  Then I sprayed it all over my hair, flipped my head over and scrunched. (If your hair tends to get frizzy, you may want to add a little cream- such as Fekkai glossing cream- as this product doesn't do much to combat frizz)  Then I blow-dryed on low for just a minute or two while scrunching, and let the rest air-dry.  I have a few pieces of hair in the front that is quite damaged from coloring, and the waves weren't that defined there.  But the rest of my hair- wow!  I never imagined having such fun waves with my relatively straight hair!  Frederic Fekkai is a genius!"

They do work very well together, but you can probably get away with just the shampoo bar. I was amazed at how much fun it was to use the shampoo bars, except you do have to keep them out of the shower or in a shampoo bar tin. 

If you are in love with the Flying Fox shower gel and temple balm, this may be the one you want. The ingredient list is impressive: Hibiscus Extreact, Shea Butter, Camellia Oil, Jojoba Oil, Macadamia Nut Oil, Coconut Butter, Jasmine, Ylang Ylang Oil, Cypress Oil, Palmarosa Oil and even a few little jasmine flowers just for fun. I loved this bar almost as much as Trichomania, also with coconut. 

I'm wondering if having hard water makes a difference when using the shampoo bars. I bought a shower filter and haven't noticed any problems with anything I've tried so far.

I mean, a shampoo/conditioner bar?  I haven't been super impressed with Lush's other solid shampoos or conditioners (at least, not enough to write a review, good or bad), so I was doubtful about this 2-in-1 bar.  But I loved the idea, and I was curious, so I bought it and I must say that Godiva far surpassed my hopes!

My hair is about shoulder length, and it only took about 6 or 7 good swipes on wet hair to work up an incredible lather! (3 or 4 swipes wasn't enough, and 10 was too much!)

My hair felt clean, but not that styrofoam-squeaky clean where *everything* is stripped from your hair.  And the conditioner is light, but doesn't really kick in until your hair dries.  I don't personnally recommend using a hair dryer, so I don't know how that would affect the conditioner, but air drying has worked great for me.

I also recommend it for travel since it's about the size of your palm, is 2-in-1, and won't leak!  

(The only warning I'd give is for the shampoo tin.  I got it for free, so maybe I shouldn't complain, but... let the shampoo bar dry before putting it into the tin!!!  It is a PAIN to get it out if you don't.)

I also LOVE the scent, but could be too strong for some people (or not strong enough).  Everyone is different, but if you don't live near a Lush store, you'll never know until you buy it!  :"

The smell is amazing: jasmine mixed with ylang-ylang.  I wouldn't recommend this product to those who don't like strong-smelling products, or to those who don't like essential oil type scents (you know who you are). 

I feel as this shampoo (along with all lush hair products) results in hair that dries quicker.  I reccommend that you blow-dry shortly after washing if you don't drip dry.  

As far as a all in one product, I still use a seperate conditioner - but that's just me, and that goes for all brands.

Garbacik ""Create Contentment""",,"I stumbled upon this shower gel collection this past Christmas season. I knew right away this would be a perfect solution for a lot of holiday gifts on my list. I was pleased that I could knock off a number of ladies off of my list with one purchase. I was even happier with the free shipping and $30 Amazon gift card offer they had going on at the time. 

I couldn't wait for the package to arrive. I ripped into it as soon as it got to me. The gels were all packed nicely in a sturdy box with handle from Philosophy. I had to restrain myself from keeping all of the gels. I managed to give away nine of them after some agonizing deliberation. (The mint chocolate chip, lemon custard, and berry ones were mine.) Plus the cool box made a perfect container for all of my other gels that I rotate according to season.

I'm a big fan of most of Philosophy's products. They have some awesome smelling shower gels as well as wonderfully working skincare products. I was already familar with the excellent cinnamon buns and double cocoa scents so I figured most of these should be pretty darn good too. The mint chocolate chip is nice but the lemon custard is weaker smelling out of the bottle. As with all of their 3-in-1s,Oh well, some will be a hit where as others will miss.

As with all of their 3-in-1s, the shower gel makes mounds of lather, cleans your skin usually without drying, and works fairly well as a shampoo too - though conditioner is typically needed. I like the shower gels a lot. I know my gal pals enjoyed their Christmas gift too. All things considered, this was a fantastic deal!"

Munro ""nyc girl at heart""",south,"Okay, so 80 bucks seems like a lot of money to plunk down for an at-home microdermabrasion kit...especially when everyone from Homedics to L 'Oreal is marketing a more cost-friendly version of what appears to be the same EXACT thing.  However, experience (and lots of money not-so-well spent) has taught me that, in most cases, you generally get what you pay for.  Case in point: a few months ago I finally made the decision to trade in my 99 cent ultra-black mascara for a high-end name brand version of the same product...I immediately discovered that mascara-induced racoon eyes really can be avoided!  Who knew?  After that, I vowed never to pinch pennies when it comes to beauty.  Now there are, of course, some exceptions; my mother swears by Oil of Olay -as do I- but when you're talking about microderabrasion, a proceedure that can cost as much as $150 per session, it's hard to believe that you can achieve the same exact results with something that is a mere fraction of the cost.

Skeptical but desperate for youthful looking skin, I opted to splurge on the DermaNew Facial Rejuvenation System.  Prior to my purchase, I did a fair amount of research so I knew that what I was getting the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of the more than twenty-plus versions that I had to choose from.  

Just two weeks after using it, I began to notice that my once sallow complexion (thanks to stress, lack of sleep and yo-yo dieting) had been replaced with a healthy glow.  Now my skin looks soft and peachy, kind of like it did when I was twelve...you know, when youth and beauty was effortless...sigh!  

All in all this product is best for someone with little to no skin flaws.  Those who are expecting miracle results or results similar to what you would get from a full-service salon treatment may be dissapointed.  My advice, shell out the necessary funds in order to get your skin under control, then use this product for the upkeep.  This is great for removing the dead skin that regular washing tends to leave behind. "

The system includes a battery operated applicator tool (batteries are included), sponge tops for the tool, and dermabrasion cream.

You pop a sponge on top of the applicator, put cream on it and apply to your dampened skin. I set a timer for 3 minutes and work the applicator around the surface of my skin. 

The results are great! Dead skin is sloughed off, circulation is stimulated and the results are glowing soft skin.
My skin looks lovely and feels smooth to the touch. It felt soft and wonderful after the very first application!

Dermanew sells other applicator sponges and creams separately to use with the applicator tool on your hands and feet.

Though the initial price tag seems high, this tool will last for years and help you to glowing skin! I highly recommend it"

If applying this yourself, it works well as an at home hair treatment to nourish the hair follicles and promote healthy hair growth. You will also notice your hair becoming stronger and retaining a much deeper shine. The essential oils in this product help to activate micro-circulation which may cause a slight tingling and warming of the scalp. Leave this in for about 5-10 minutes and then wash your hair as normal. You may find you need less conditioner when using this product. Many hairdressers will use this product when giving a conditioning head massage and that is where I first found out about this product. I bought my first bottle the day I had the massage.

When I'm shopping it seems that most lines cater to lighter and medium skin tones, but Bobbi Brown really does come through with flattering options for all skin tones. The only draw back is that this foundation does not provide adequate SPF protection, even though it says SPF 15. Therefore, you will still need to wear a sunscreen underneath of at least SPF 15. I use this foundation every day and I wear sunscreen from Paula's Choice (which I love).

So I was willing to try anything, especially from LUSH, because all of their products are of such high quality.  Last time I visited their shop, I bought the 8 oz bottle of this because it didn't have anything that I knew I was allergic to in it.

Over three months later now, and I'm still using it.  I've even come to like the smell.  And I only have to use a scalp treatment shampoo (Nizoral or Meted, which are great for the scalp but hard on the hair) maybe once a week for maintenence.  I can wear black and not have to shake my shirt off every 10 minutes.  There are no painful lesions hiding under my hair.

I could spend an entire evening in a pair of Italian heels and this fragrance alone. A matter of fact I did. 

When I smell Chanel # 19 I think of cold winter nights wrapped up in cashmere laying on a leather chaise with the heat of a warm fire bath me. Chanel #19 evokes the glorious feel of crisp winters and elegant evenings. A subtle fragrance that becomes more powerful with the heat of your body so it's best in the winter or very special occasions.

I highly recommend Chanel # 19 if you need a lift in mood this winter. One whiff and your mood will be elevated, I promise. Even the sight of the perfume is wonderful. A beautiful classic glass Chanel bottle' the delicate liquid beckons you to put it on and enjoy. Just the feel of the bottle in your hand is glorious.

Evoke your sense of smell, sight, and touch with Chanel # 19.

This sumptuous cream from Clarins will help avoid that ""rugged"" look on the neck as soon as it starts to become evident; thus making you look younger because, once the signs of aging start to appear on the neck, they reflect on a woman's appearance as a whole.  You will notice a difference in the tightness of the skin of your neck right after the first application.  Subsequent ones will just make a good thing even better.

Clarins has been a leader in beauty products for years now and they have been my favorite brand since I discovered them in my early twenties. Their line is extensive in very specific treatments (such as body and bust oils, etc.); so much much so, that I've never seen a neck cream from any of the other prestigious skin care brands - such as Shiseido and Guerlain for instance.

I had really deep cracks in my heels with sharp chunks poking out - even using a heel file didn't help! But these things are already showing drastic improvement!  The only part that's hard for me is soaking my feet first, so I usually do it in the morning after my shower.  {Another nice benefit of being a stay at home mom ;-)}

My box lists step by step instructions including how to hand wash them. After 4 uses (2-3 hours as stated previously) I feel no need to wash these - my feet do NOT sweat in them.  I've even worn a pair of slipper socks over them to help keep them clean when I walked around the house (careful with that one - they're pretty slick when you first put them on with the softening sock salve!) and my feet still didn't sweat.

I DO recommend using the softening sock salve with them for faster results.

Elkins ""his wife""","Waynesburg, KY, USA","I received a smaple size of this face creme with my recent order of my hunny's anniversary present from Estee Lauder. It came with a bunch of other stuff that I either swapped or gave away, but this was a real winner for me. It came as a 5-day supply, and I just wish I had more. 

I used this creme as a supplement to other lotions I wasn't thrilled with, namely, Neutrogena Whip Moisturizer with SPF 15 or 30, and Clinique Super City Block SPF 40(but I'm still undecided about this one). Both of these weren't smooth enough. they didn't have that nice slip to spread easily across the skin. The former I had to use a lot of on its owen to really moisturize the lower half of my face, and the latter I had to rub very hard in order to get it to spread without this creme. 

I love that this creme gets the job done. Out of all the moisturizers I have used for my face, I have had to use this one the most sparingly in order to moisturize, and I like that. I can imagine it coests more than the other two moisturizers, but it also does a better job. 

I don't like that when I first put it on, it seems to warm up my face a bit around the nose and mouth. Ordinarily this wouldn't bother me, but seeing as to how almost every other thing has been breaking me out recently, it makes me a teensy bit paranoid. Howver, this sensation does not persist, so I don't worry too much about it. The other thing is that it takes alittle longer to sink into the skin, and until it does, it gives my skin the look as if I have been sweating, but then it's in and my skin just feels good. 

Isn't that what moisture is all about?

Immediately, I liked the thinner-sized tube (can't stand those overly fat mascaras!) and the stiff-bristled brush. The product is a bit on the dry side, but I much prefer that to wet and gloppy. There wasn't too much product on the brush, and it was easy to apply. I definitely noticed a lengthening effect beyond what I've seen with any other mascara, which was great because it made my small eyes look much more open. Also, the product stayed put all day long, absolutely no smudging or flaking. My only slight disappointment was that it left my lashes looking a bit thin, as the effect is long and spidery; I guess I'm used to the fullness I get from my everyday mascara, Full and Soft.  I will continue to use Definicils for times when I particularly want more length, and I've found that I can layer it with my Full and Soft to get both the length and fullness I want.

However, I have been having to bleach my bath towels to get out the leftover mousse on my legs after I get out of the shower at night (If I don't it gets on my sheets.)  Also, you have to work quickly with your hands to spread the mousse before it streaks. Then you have to clean it from your fingernails.

I tried this Modelco spray at Sephora today.  It goes on very evenly, no hand blending needed.  It is lighter than the medium Neutrogena, which is great bec I am very fair skinned.  Much easier to apply, but costs a lot more.  I'll prob use it on weekends because you can spray all those hard to reach areas.  During the week when I'm just doing my legs I'll  stick to the cheaper Neutrogena product."

Each wash is 2 oz. and enough for a few uses, making it fun to do a switcheroo every time I hop in the shower. The scents are Tropical Mango, Coconut, Passionfruit, Strawberry, and Satsuma.

Mango is lovely, slightly tangy and bitter , like a grapefruit but with a velvety sweet scent that is a pleasure to use. This is a gel.

Coconut is another favorite, creamy and juicy, like real coconut milk, not overly sweet but pure and authentic smelling. This is a creamy wash, not a gel.

Passionfruit is refreshing, green and purple at the same time, smells like a mixture of kiwis, lemons and melon,  a contrast of tart and sweet succulence.

Strawberry is not bad but has a hint of plastic in it, it's not the truest flavor I came across, but it seems pretty hard to fabricate, since the fruit itself is slightly sour and delicate. For a shower gel its fine, but if this was a flavored food product I'd probably skip it. This comes in the gel form.

Satsuma is crazy, a sugary tropical warm orange like hot flavor that turns my bathroom into a wicked retreat from reality. Very strong and pungent but fun when I'm in the mood for intense tropical experience. This comes in the gel form.

Overall I have nothing but praise, although the price is a bit high, but the whole set is a fun way to try out all the flavors and makes a great gift, it also lookS beautiful in the see through container, like a carousel of colors waiting to be enjoyed.

It's a very natural and beautiful shade.  It is sheer as the name implies, but there is still a good amount of color.  The smell is pleasant and sweet, with a smooth and light texture.  It has the coverage of a lipstick and the moisture of a gloss, without being sticky. It's kind of like a tinted lip balm, but the color is more substantial.  It actually feels better on my lips than a balm.  The appearance is semi-glossy, but not goopy looking like a traditional gloss. There is a little bit of sparkle, but it's not chunky like glitter.  I would prefer it not to have any sparkle at all, which is my only complaint (and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5).  I think the formula is shiny enough that it doesn't need any added glimmer effect.  Honestly, I think cosmetics manufacturers have gone overboard with putting glitter in virtually everything.  Enough already!  Anyway, I still like this lipstick despite my sparkle hang-up.  It is packaged in a slim silver tube that is very chic, simple, and easy to apply."

I use this by warming it slightly in the microwave so it sinks in better, then applying it to dry hair. I tie my hair into a bun and wait twenty minutes or so, then rinse it gently, wash my hair using The Blonde shampoo, and condition with a light conditioner.

If you don't really want your hair lightened much and just want a bit of extra shine and highlight to your blonde hair, this is great on its own. If you want a more dramatic effect, The Blonde solid conditioner works for a stronger effect. The Blonde can be drying though so I do like to use them together"

I knew this was a product that would become a beauty staple around my house. I have since purchased several other items from Fresh, especially from their skincare, bodycare and fragrance lines. I find that Fresh Soy Formula f21c Face Cleanser is one of their best products. And the price is right, especially given the cost of some of the high quality face cleansers on the market.

This unique face cleansing gel is fabulous. The texture is somewhat unusual. It is a clear gel and feels very slippery when applied. The gel foams, ever-so-slightly, almost like a lotion,  and feels great on dry skin. The face cleanser does an excellent job of removing makeup and leaving the skin soft, comfortably clean and glowing. It also tones the skin, revives the eyelid area and conditions the eyelashes in the process. What could be better? And all in one single product! 

For the winter months, this is a perfect compromise between the fresh, clean feeling of a gel and the comfortable, soothing feeling of a lotion. It is my normal-to-dry skin's new favorite cleanser. Soy Face Cleanser contains rose extract, cornflower extract, glycerin, mallow extract, chamomile extract, ginseng, aloe, soybean powder, soybean protein, borage seed oil, cucumber extract, vitamin A, vitamin E and gentle cleansing agents.

I cannot recommend Fresh skin and body products enough - and the Fresh Soy Formula Face Cleanser is a winner!

Each product has a certain Earthy quality it and its nice knowing that people who make each an every single on of these luscious concoctions love them as much as the customers do and it shows!

The Karma soap looks like a slab of gold in shape but is really reminiscent of candied carrots I would find in fruit cakes I used to eat as a kid growing up in Poland. The clarity of the fiery jewel like color is quite attractive as it makes for a nice soap to put in the guest bathroom or for self spoiling with hand made soaps that beat the other cookie cutter types by a mile. The scent itself is a breezy breath of citrus with mother earth embedded deep in the core. The lavender and patchouli are a whisper, a shadowy backbone to the zest and freshness. The multidimensionality of layering scents makes fore a very uplifting experience and I can smell the heady aromas every time I was my hands with it. I also love the Karma perfume, which smells almost exactly as the soap.

I find that my hands don't get as dry when I use this glycerin soap as opposed to regular soaps laden with chemicals and lards. But I always use a hand cream afterwards, preferably one of those gooey Burt's Bees creams that come in heavy glass jars. My hands never crack or get dry no matter how dry the air or how cold it is when I used Lush soaps and a good hand cream.

Schneider,,"This cologne is very spicy and is perhaps one of my favorites next to Burberry Fragrance for men. Whereas Burberry Fragrance was fruity, Brit is slightly different in that the scent is more floral and certainly more spicy (and yet not as heavy or as complex as London).

For something as spicy I'm quite surprised with how light this one comes across (in comparison with London which was just a little too heavy for me). I have to agree with other reviewers and say that it's still by far very masculine indeed. Vanilla is immediately noticed, as well as more fruity undertones which only increase as time passes (""juicy green mandarin,"" perhaps but you need to be a poet to sense it... again, admittedly sweet). Warning, this product is not nearly as citrus/lemon/orange the Burberry Fragrance; instead it follows in London's footsteps and provides spiciness in yet a more minimal way.

Can be worn in a similar fashion, either for formal affairs or casual ones, though I'd gather it is selected most often for casual ones (I did find a similarity between this and Chanel's Allure, and yet I find Allure much more pungent... I love Allure, but if you want something a little more mellow for the night, this is your product).

Sweet, spicy, deep and complex Brit marks itself as my second favorite from the Burberry line - sharing the spot right on top with the Burberry Fragrance! Can be worn daily without becoming tiring, a feature which I think it holds over Burberry Fragrance whose citrus-sweet Fragrance may become an annoyance"

I apply it in a thin layer after a shower or bath in the morning and the moisture thins it out so it sinks in right away, and a thicker layer at night so it can sink in fully while I sleep.

The lotion works perfectly, but honestly, I buy it for the scent. It isn't often you can find such a naturally scented vanilla lotion. The banana is so light you can barely smell it, but gives an overall feeling of an ice-creamk or lovely dessert scent, rich and delicious.

Since I use this at night time, it's not that big of a deal, but I wouldn't use this as a day cream because it's a little to heavy for me.

Besides the oiliness, the lotion did work well and really helped to moisturize my hands, which are usually dry and cracked because of so much dishwashing.  I follow with LUSH's Lemony Flutter Cuticle Butter and my hands have never looked better.

Hmmmmm, seems to me that consolation, condolences and commiseration should be extended to those who don't have a small tub of this at the ready.  They probably have to put up with dry, tight-feeling skin crying for a kind word or, better yet, a moisturizing body lotion.

Truth be told,  skin needs our utmost attention - summer, winter, springtime and fall.  In the cold months it's buried under so much warm clothing that it can't breathe or dehydrated by central heating.  In the warm months it's parched by the sun and blown dry by air conditioning.  Yet, it stays with us.

When we're having fun, our skin is not.  Did you have a ball dancing all night?   Think of how those tired tootsies feel in the morning.  Were you the belle of the beach playing volleyball in your teeny-weeny bikini?  Too much sun, eh?  Your skin took it not only on the chin but all over your toned bod.  It needs TLC.

""Sympathy for the Skin"" is a rich, soothing potion of a lotion laced with healing ingredients such as Almond Oil, Cocoa Butter, Sandalwood Oil, Fresh Bananas.    Creamy in appearance it's a luxurious emollient that is absorbed quickly by your grateful skin and leaves a lovely subtle scent of vanilla.

There are those days when I must have a soothing hot bath, which I know depletes skin of moisture.  So, after bathing I simply pat skin with a towel and then smooth on ""Sympathy for the Skin"" while skin is still damp.  Works wonders!  That's what's known as having your soak and silky skin, too"

I had acne as a teenager and I also have larger pores. The scars have diminished (not completely, mind you!) and my pores are much smaller. I also have sensitive skin and this system does not irritate my skin. My skin also tends to be flaky when irritated and the idealist system had taken care of the problem. My advice is that you must use the Idealist in the morning and at night for your skin to get the total benefit of the micro-d product. I tried using the Idealist only at night and the benefits were not as great. It's expensive, but worth it. By the way, I have been using the .5 oz. sample size of the micro-d and I still have plenty left after about 5 uses. So this stuff will last you a very long time. You only have to use it twice a week (use it any more and it will irritate your skin). 

The first time you use it, you may be a little uncomfortable as there is a definite warming sensation. It also felt a little uncomfortable and made my skin a little pink, but it subsided very quickly and it was all worth it in the end. 

Great product"

First, you wash your face with the Clinique soap best-suited for your skin type (normal, dry or combination/greasy), then you follow it with their clearing lotion (ie exfoliant/astringent) and you (finally) apply this gel to your face and neck.

Many rose oils are reminiscent of a rose garden. This rose oil reminds me of a wild rose bush you would find in a cedar forest. There is a hint of comforting cedar wood with varied elements of fragrance not unlike a fine perfume. Spicy notes mingle with sweet rose perfection while delicate high points capture your attention. Of all the rose oils, this one has numerous elements to lift your mood and scent everything from bath products to laundry soaps. The highly concentrated oil will last for a long time. One drop of this in a spray bottle of spring or mineral water and you have a beautifully scented skin refresher. Put a drop on a  cloth and toss it in the dryer for rose scented towels. Add to your fabric softener or drop the tiniest amount on a card you are sending to a friend. 

The sheer value of this product is astounding when you consider how expensive rose oil can be. The high concentration is superior to all other rose oils I've tried and this is very affordable. In this case, you seem to get more than you paid for. If you are looking to add rose oil to your collection, this is the best one I've found for blending with other oils and making bath products and scenting products I use around the house. 

This oil will bring a poetic beauty to your life and can alleviate times of emotional upheaval. Use for dry skin (add to creams), addictive behavior, anger, despair, depression, grief, nervous anxiety, heart problems, emotional fatigue, irritability and insomnia. Since this is highly concentrated, you may want to blend it with jojoba oil first before mixing into beauty products. 

Caswell-Massey also sells a divine Egyptian Musk, Ylang Ylang and Lilac oil. Very affordable oils and unlike other brands were you have to almost pour the oils in the tub, a few drops will do. Highly Recommended.

The lipstick goes on as shiny as lipgloss but has the texture of lip balm. The colors, though sheer, still have good pigmentation; the sheerness is actually a benefit because it allows the lipstick color to blend well with your natural lip color, lessening the chance that your lip color will come out looking unnatural. The Aqualumiere line of lipsticks do need to be reapplied more often than a less sheer lipstick, but the lasting power is still relatively high, and reapplication is less of a bother because of the lipstick's texture.

Though I have not tried all the colors, the pinks in this formula--Waikiki in particular--strike me as especially natural and face-brightening"

I always dreaded shaving after a hunting or fishing trip. Even the old Gillette twist-open requires that it be partially opened to properly rinse out the cream and whisker sludge. This guy has a nice round cavity underneath each cutting edge that allows water to wash everything away. Even shaking it in a bowl will clear it most of the time. If it should clog, one can blow it out quite easily. I have only used the lower settings, and they are all I seem to need with good blades. The Gillette blades sold in the US are horrible, BTW. Use Merkur blades or Swedish Gillettes for the best shave.

My only complaint is that the alignment marks to match up the top and body are faint, and the adjustment marks do not line up properly, and I am forced to do math to get repeatability. I have higher expectations for German engineering and the price.

This thing is overpriced for what it is, but a good shave is worth a lot, and you only buy it once"

One of those is Hypnose and I really like it for when I go out or just looking for that dramatic look.

Postive:
1.) The look: I've never neccessarily wanted to wear fake eyelashes but they do look almost perfect. Unbelievably, Hypnose gives you that look. It's amazing just how feathery your eyelashes look.
2.) Flaking: This mascara never really flaked on the bottom of my eyes. That's really important to me.

Negative:
1.) This mascara starts out great but after about two and a half weeks it starts emptying out on you. This might just be because there were days when I reapplyed it or simply because I just used it pretty well (1 coat just about everyday because of how much I liked it).

Summary: If you want that natural yet ""are those real lashes?!"" look, then you'll like this mascara. I'm giving it four stars instead of five simply because of how long it lasts but if you use it once it a while, then it will last you a while"

Solid shampoos can be intimidating if you have never used them before, but LUSH makes the experience fun and easy.  A little bit of this bar rubbed into your hair creates a nice lather and leaves your hair feeling fresh and clean.  A solid shampoo is also good for travel, as it doesn't spill or explode all over your luggage"

Although, an initial coloring with Henna may be recommended, this extends the color and shine and can make your hair feel like it has more body and bounce. 

This is super fun to use in the tub and really works up a lather in your hair that is rich and moisturizing. Rhassoul mud conditions the scalp while Persian Henna gives you color. The scent is like an earthy apple cider with hints of orange and rosemary. Dry this bar out between uses by keeping it in a soap container. 

What I noticed most after the first use was how long my hairstyle lasted and how my hair had that ""whish, whish"" super clean feel. I also noticed a deepening of the color. If you have oily hair, this is a deep cleansing shampoo that will give you a lot more body along with the shine. Follow with a rich conditioner like LUSH American Cream or the earthy Jungle bar. 

Why are shampoo bars so much fun? This one definitely makes my lush favorites list. If you used one of the lemony shampoos (I Love Juicy) and it took out some of the color, this seems to work well to restore the color.

The comb is handcrafted in France with wide teeth, smoothly rounded to protect hair. It's a beauty on its own, as you can see. It allows easy distribution of the product whether it's a conditioner or a treatment mask. It's a breeze to use in the shower and also ideal for comb-outs. 

Frederic recommends applying a conditioning treatment 1-2 times a week to maintain healthy hair. To date, I've been very well pleased with all of Frederic's products and his advice. This is a man who knows hair and how to care for it.

Hawkins ""Laura Wilde""",USA,"Oil Free and perfect for any skin type, Clinique's Blended Loose Powder has been a top seller and award winner in the prestige makeup category for decades. Each jar (fits on your palm) comes with a swivel out brush (retracted it's about three inches long) that can be used for application and or touchups. Inside the jar is a plastic screen that helps you keep the majority of the powder in the jar even during application -- wonderful for those of us who tend to drop and spill.

Special Tips For Use:
To get the most flawless finish, Clinique recommends an application technique they call the ""powder rub down."" Tip a tiny amount of powder from the jar into one hand. Very gently rub your hands together to lightly distribute the powder across both palms. Then use your hands to `wash' your face with the powder. This technique helps keep the hairs on the brush from pushing the powder into the pores, accentuating their appearance. Any excess you see afterwards can be whisked off with the swivel-out brush that comes with each jar. 

If you like to touch up with powder throughout the day but don't want to carry the jar or a pressed powder compact, simply dip your brush into the powder in the top of the jar, swivel retract the bristles containing the powder, pop the cap on top, and you can now drop the brush into your purse for a loose powder touch up any time. 

Color Notes: 
-Transparency 1: Has almost no discernible color. For the palest of the pale. This powder is only a hairs breath darker than baby powder.
-Transparency 2: This powder has a noticeable light pink tone. Excellent for perking up a sallow (yellowish) complexion. Also great for Asian women who want that porcelain look.  As a redhead, I find this color powder gives my skin the perk it needs without leaving me looking orange as so many others do.
-Transparency Neutral: Like Transparency 2 without the pink for when 1 is too light and 3 is too dark.
-Transparency 3: Clinique's most popular color . . . by far.  If you've ever received a sample in a Gift before, this is it. A very safe color to choose.
-Transparency 4 Plus: A little darker than the old Transparency 4. For when you have a tan or if you're olive or Hispanic without much of a tan.
-Transparency 5: For when you're dark naturally. A big jump from Transparency 4 Plus. Dark Hispanics and the well tanned fit well here.
-Transparency 6: For dark complexions such as African American, though won't be dark enough for the darkest of dark.
-Transparency Bronze: For all skin colors. Although all the other colors are matte in finish (no shine, glisten, or sparkles) Transparency Bronze is the exception.

I used a Gillette Sensor. It was okay. I upgraded to Sensor XL. It was pretty good. I tried a Mach 3, and I hated it -- it felt like I was wiping my face with a wall of blades. I finally settled on Sensor 3 -- at nearly 2 bucks a blade. It got the job done, but there was no real joy in shaving. Considering I have to do it at least once a day (twice if I'm going out at night) the process should be more enjoyable.

After quite a bit of research, including newsgroups and customer reviews, I splurged and got the Merkur Futur (though I got the chrome finish). 

Shaving is awesome, and I literally look forward to it. Lathering up the shave cream (I use Crabtree and Evelyn Sandlewood) with this brush is a real treat. Super soft, holds a ton of water, and results in a thick lather. (Be warned, the first few times you use it, it stinks like wet badger... but it goes away).

The razor itself is heavy... I mean heavy. Which is good, because you need to let the razor do the work -- NO PRESSURE, OR YOU WILL TAKE OFF YOU FACE). The main difference between this razor and shaving with cartridges, is that you actually feel the blade against your face (as opposed to a chunk of plastic).  Anyone who has had a shave with a barber knows how great this feels.

Once I got the technique down it is as close and smooth a shave as I have ever had. Finishing up with a cold water splash, non-alcoholic toner / aftershave, and a moisturizing lotion, is an invigorating way to start the day.

Please note: as stated above the brush smells a little ""badgery"" at first, but it goes away. The head of the razor does not pivot, so you have to follow the contours of your face. And the head itself it bulky, so you have to work on your technique around your nose, and under you chin.

In sum, this razor adds an old-school, refreshing routine to my mornings. I love it, and would whole-heartedly recommend it."

With a proper shaving technique and some patience you'll be getting the best shave of your life.  The razor is adjustable meaning you can change the closeness of the blade for different shave settings( 1 to 6 progressively closer) and this razor scores highly on shaving review boards.  I would highly recommend this kit it looks great and is a essential to proper mens grooming.  Pick this up with some high quality shaving cream (Taylors of old bond street, trumpers, truefitt &hill) and a quality aftershave and enjoy.

Blaize,"Jacksonville, FL United States","During my seven year shaving career, I've run the gauntlet of shaving implementations.  After shaving with contemporary disposable cartridge razors and electric razors with `goo', I was left with much to be desired.  Ingrown hairs and razor burn were starting to be a little too familiar.   

Upon taking the set out of the box, I was met by quality and heft from each piece and went straight to the sink for a test drive.  I didn't receive my Art of Shaving lavender scented shave cream until the day after, so I made do with the Aveno shave gel I had on hand.  The first thing I experienced while working up a lather with the badger hair brush, was the distinct smell of wet badger.  After a thorough washing and rinsing, the badger smell had subsided enough to continue.  I had read a few guides from classicshaving.com on the proper technique, but really there was nothing to it.  I made sure my skin was taught and let the weight of the shaver do all the work.  I found that it didn't take much longer than a normal shave, even on my first go.  It took me two weeks of shaving to get my first knick.  At that point, I was getting a little complacent and placed the razor on my chin at an odd angle.  It was very minor and I haven't repeated the folly.  

The smell of wed badger totally subsided after about three days of use; replaced by the soothing smell of lavender.  I'm looking forward to trying out other shave creams.  While the Art of Shaving cream provides adequate lather coverage, I feel that it could be thicker.  I am, however, only comparing it to contemporary shave gels, whose thousands of dollars of R&D could produce incomparable lather results.  I foresee me and my Futur in a life long relationship.  

I asked my dad why he never told me about the satisfaction you can get from a good double edged wet shave.  He said, ""I don't know.  I guess it's just been so long since I've used one.  Right now, I'm using one with 4 blades that vibrates.""  Guess what he got for father's day. "

Rudock ""CleverCynic""",NC,"I was reluctant to get this one because it was one of the few I was already familiar with from the ole high school days, for many of the same reasons the other reviewer stated, it's been around for a long time and many already have good or bad associations with the scent and other guys who have worn it. I can understand why he gave it three stars, but I'm here to review it based on its scent and merits and not the pop-culture story that surrounds it. 
The fact is, Guy Laroche nailed an almost perfect scent right at the eve of the fragrance for men explosion. While its Polo Green counterpart tended to smell more to me like a pesticide in the bottle, this cologne is both decidedly masculine and decidedly beautiful at the same time. It has elegance and blatant animalism. It is musky and spicy without being floral or citrusy. The age and popularity and generation (zeroing in on age) associated with it will probably prevent me from overusing it, but it still ranks very high in scent tests from woman, possibly continuing to be the best fragrance out there. As for the synthetic scent the other reviewer mentioned, this is probably of the last made before the manipulation of benzene aromatics very common in most newer colognes that he probably likes a lot. Most likely its the lack of organic citrus notes that caused the statement. 
It's not hip or the newest thing, but damn does it smell GOOD! "

I had my hair up in a bun (I had put it up to workout) and when I let down my hair after it was dry it felt so much thicker and almost like I had more hair.

I was not quite sure why, but then I read about the strengthening effects of this shampoo and conditioner. My hair also felt so much cleaner and silky as if there was no build up and I had washed my hair in mountain spring water.

Ingredients in Shampoo: Water, Rice Bran, Rice Oil, Coconut Oil, Seaweed, Ginseng, Aloe, Wheat Powder, Swertia Herb.
Ingredients in Conditioner: Water, Rice Bran, Rice Oil, Coconut Oil, Seaweed, Ginseng, Aloe, Wheat Powder, Swertia Herb, Natural Vitamin E.

Since this product is relatively expensive, I may have to alternate it with other shampoos and conditioners, but it definitely works. The shampoo doesn't strip the hair the way other harsh shampoos do and I'm very impressed with the natural ingredients cleaning my hair so well. If you have fine or oily hair you may be especially impressed. You also only have to shampoo once, which saves time.

Results after one use:

Smoother Texture
Stronger Hair
Cleaner Hair
More Body - especially if you have fine hair

Looking forward to trying other products with rice bran. You can order a week's supply of this product to try. I think you will fall in love with the shampoo and conditioner.

As I got older (Im 38 now) it seemed to get darker. I am a makeup artist by profession, so believe me when I say that I have tried all kinds of concealers. Some went on smooth but the coverage didnot last and by mid-day there were those dark circles again. I literally had to carry concealer with me because I had to reapply atleast 3 times a day. The heavier concealers worked when I put them on but after awhile it would cake under my eyes, dry out and make my lines more visible and really made me look older! I was hesitant about Hylexin, like everyone, because of the price. I started using it but didnt see any results after few days. I guess it didnt help that I was constantly looking in the mirror.I started to get disappointed but kept on using it. I swear by the 3rd-4th week I could actually see a difference! My circles were way lighter and less noticeable! I dont have ""bags"" or puffiness, just dark circles and I have olive skin. As I continue to use it, it seems to be getter better and better. It might not take it away completely, but it sure has faded enough that I can now use a concealer (or just a fuller coverage foundation!) and not have to worry about it fading or caking. I feel bad that some people may not have gotten the results that they hoped for, but what do you have to loose! Yeah $95 is alot, but its cheaper and not as invasive as surgery. And it has the same 50/50 chance as cosmetic procedures. Everyones skin is different and reacts differently like any other skincare/cosmetics product. Also, you need to follow the instructions exactly! I applied twice a day and didnot skip any application. I tried very hard to stay out of the sun and used my same skincare routine. I will post another review in a few weeks and see if the circles improved anymore.  I hope this review has helped"

I started out with a half-size product from a combo trial pack, and I liked it so much that I've bought the full size product now.  It last forever, so it's really not that expensive over time.

Though a little expensive for what you get, still an overall good product.  I will be switching to the individual AVON cleanser and AVON toner, only because I've read that using a 2-in-1 cleanser/toner is not as effective as using them seperately.  Besides, the Avon ANEW RETROACTIVE+ 2-in-1 Cleanser cost $12.00 for 4.2 oz, where the cleanser and toner by themselves cost $12.00 each but you are getting 5.1 oz.  So you are getting more for your money if you buy them seperately"

I put it in myself and followed the directions exactly.  In the past, I've had really bad problems with relaxers burning my scalp to the point I've had scabs all over my head.  That's another reason why I tried this product.  It did burn, but not NEARLY as bad as other relaxers my stylist has used.  It was extremely manageable and not very uncomfortable.  I only left the product on my hair for the 25 minutes it recommends.    It took something like 12 shampoos for the stuff to neutralize.  My hair turned out curly instead of straight.  Guess I didn't ""smooth"" well enough.  I would def recommend to have a stylist put it in for you so you get the great results.  My hair looks really great flat ironed, but the true test will come after I've had the perm in for a few weeks.  My hair typically breaks off really bad right around the time that I need a retouch.  I am hoping that doesn't happen w/this product.  That will really let me know if it's worth the 60 bucks"

My mum was the one who found it and I'm eternally grateful to her as it worked out fantastic. Thanx Mum :) 

I am used to using various box relaxers from the store (Gentle Treatment, TCB, Dark and Lovely etc) and none of these come close. I have a combination of European/Carribean hair which is thick and coarse and so I need a really good relaxer to make it soft and straight.My hair has never been this straight from a box relaxer and it actually moves! :)

There is none of the usual ""burning"" sensation that often goes along with most relaxers. Nor is there a strong overwhelming smell that is enough to knock you out.

The quantity of the contents is great aswell. There are very few relaxers that you find with enough Conditioner provided to be used again later on.

It is well worth the price.My personal experience gave Salon results at a slightly cheaper price yet more expensive than those sold at Walgreens. I'll stick with the Phytorelaxer."

I relax and highlight my hair, so imagine the hell I was in when I heard that you should not chemically treat your hair when you are pregnant.  I tried to go along with that, however after 8 weeks I was in dire need of something.  I searched the web for a safe product and found this relaxer.  After rinsing it out and using the phyto shampoo and conditioner I was horrified with the fact that my hair felt like straw.  I rewashed it with Keracare shampoo and conditioner and it felt normal again.  The phyto relaxer did the same thing as a cheap drugstore relaxer, however it has a pleasant scent and doesn't burn your scalp.  After doing 2 or 3 relaxers myself I started to notice breakage.  But I assumed that it was from being pregnant.  I stopped doing my own relaxers when my belly started to weigh me down entirely too much.  I called Phyto and they gave me a listing of salons that use the relaxer on clients.  The salon I went to explained to me that I didn't understand placement when it comes to relaxer.  I was pretty much overlapping the product onto previously relaxed hair.  The instructions say not to do it, but it is really hard to control that.  I continued going to the salon for the relaxers and my hair grew back.  
Now a year later, I continue to use the salon and the product.  I am breastfeeding my son, so I stay away from the chemicals still.  I suggest this relaxer to all of my pregnant friends that don't want to walk around with crazy hair.  I mean pregnancy makes you feel bad enough"

Beware it's Gritty in Texture but that's why I love it!,"September 30, 2005",T. Justice,"Pittsburgh, PA","I'm 28 and have always had what I would call average skin, the kind that most women have. I have normal skin with a little more oiliness in the T-Zone and I get blackheads and the occasional breakout. I have tried all kinds of different product lines (Urban Defense, DDF, Dior, Philosphy, Bliss, etc.) and am the happiest with the results I get from Murad. 
I can't review just one product because I think the combination is what gives me such great results. I have been using Murad for about 2 1/2 years now so I have tried a lot of the Murad products and found a routine that works great for me. 

In the morning I use the AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser (love it! the gritiness gives you very smooth surface for applying makeup) then the Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel and the Skin Perfecting Lotion which I mix and apply together so that I don't use as much. Last I put on my Moisture Silk Eye Gel and I'm ready to go.  

At night I use the Clarifying Cleanser followed by the Clarifying Toner, the Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel, the Perfecting Lotion and the best product of all the Night Reform Treatment (see my review of that product for details, I love it!) and again I use the Moisture Silk Eye Gel. 

Once a week I throw in the Exfoliating Fruit Enzyme Mask and I have perfect skin if I stick to the program everyday. My skin looks and feels better than it ever has and people always guess my age to be around 23 so it must be doing something right! 

Top 5 Favorite Murad Products:
1. Soothing Lip Therapy
2. Night Reform Treatment
3. Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel
4. AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser
5. Clarifying Cleanser

Murad Products that I don't like:
1. Day Reform Treatment (too greasy and I hate the smell)
2. Purifying Face Scrub 
3. The products for combination skin - they are ok but the acne line is so mild that people with combination skin will see better results using it. (I have used both product lines)"

I am an esthetician that has lots of trouble with hormonal breakouts on my chin, jawline and neck. I had been using a system with benzoyl peroxide that was just too drying, even though I do have an oily skin type. This kit is great. All of the products are full size (except the samples of the peels). The products are very concentrated, so I expect that this kit will last around 3 months. I noticed an immediate difference in my skin - brighter, firmer, healthier glow. I've now been using it for two weeks. I've had a few hormonal breakouts (right before my period) but they are very small and clear up much faster. It is really getting rid of  red scarring left over from previous breakouts and my fine lines around my eyes are certainly decreasing too. The sample peels in the kit are awesome. You can get 2 peels out of each sample set - so about a total of 6 treatments. I reccomend using the peels 2X week to get you started - it really kicks up the results"

I have been washing my hair with the Shine and protect shampoo and conditioner twice a week (I washed my hair everyday, but I can't wash it everyday with Ojon because it would be too heavy). My hair looks longer since I have been using this product and it seems healthier and shinier. it smells sort like gum or push-ups. I will definitely be buying full sizes of these when I run out. The leave in glossing cream I used every time I wash my hair. The tube size is 2 oz (the same as the shampoo and conditioner) but, it takes so little for my hair that I think it will last six to eight months and it really does work. This is probably the best glossing cream ever (certainly for oily hair)- it's better than Kiehls and Frederic Fekkai and they are both really good. I also use the  shine and protect glossing mist when I ""do"" my hair (straightening iron or rollers). It works well and makes my hair glossy not greasy and stringy. The last product is the Restorative hair treatment I have used it once and it's conditioning and trufully it does smell strongly (like baby oil and dirt? coffee grounds? ashes?) But, I really didn't notice that the smell lingered after I washed my hair and I think if used it on dry hair you would have really good results"

It gets really frizzy in humid weather and I used to use John Frieda serum, and that worked well for me. The bottle was just really small and I would run out fast because of my long hair. I decided to buy this product. It has a thinner consistency than John Frieda's serum but it works just as well. It does make my hair soft and it tames the flyaways, but I would not use this product alone in my hair. I usually put a little of this on before I blowdry, a little afterwards and then I put Bed Head's after party in my hair before I straight iron my hair. Both the bed head and Biosilk really sink into my hair and gets absorbed and never looks greasy. After I do that, my hair is super soft. 
I like that the bottle is a good size considering you only need like a dime sized amount but I think it is a little pricey. But considering how long it will last, I think it is worth it. I would never use this on my skin (It says you can use this on your skin) just because I would feel like I am putting oil or something on my skin. And it also smells a little like hair spray, but it is not overpowering. Once you put it in your hair, you cannot smell it. All in all, a great product."

I have used it for a few years now, and my hair is in the best condition it has probley ever been in. I have very thick, curly hair that I regularly straighten with a CHI hot iron and color treat, so my hair is rather prone to damage. Before I used this product, my hair was FRIED! It was dry, crispy, and always smelled burnt from straighting it. It was pretty bad. When I went to get my hair cut, the hair dresser made a comment on how badly damaged my hair was. I told her it was from straighting and coloring my hair, and she told my about Biosilk. I little bottle came with the CHI I bought, but I had never bothered to use it. She told me to apply a little bit of it before the next time I straighten my hair to see if it helped. After my first use, my hair was noticably softer, shinier, and less frizzy. So, i continued to use it. It worked even better after I used it for while. It improved the overall condition of my hair, and has made it so much more managable. Another great thing about Biosilk is the subsatnce of it. It has thick, watery like, smooth feel to it. I use about a quarter-sized amount after a shower on wet hair, and right before I style on dry hair. It is so light weight, I can't even tell I have anything in my hair. Because I don't have to use very much, a bottle lasts me for several months. Sure its a little expensive, but it is defenitly worth it!

Johnson,,"I have been getting irritated skin / razor bumps / ingrown hairs (the whole nine yards) ever since I started shaving.  I've tried different cartridges, different methods of shaving, and even a cutthroat razor (had to give that up right away -- much too much maintenance).  However, with the purchase of this Merkur HD safety razor, I've finally found a product that I can stick with.  People say it takes some getting used to, but I found it not the slightest bit more difficult than shaving with a cartridge razor.  I get the closest shaves ever with it, with practically no irritation.  Other pluses include blades that last nearly a week and only cost 50 cents a piece!!  With cartridges costing up to three dollars, it's time to go old school (especially since I'm a poor college student).

I can't compare this model to other safety razors, but I can say that it is a great intro safety razor.  Good weight, and simple to use.  I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone fed up with the cost of cartridges, and looking for a simple, effective solution"

I'm 24.  My first razor was the same kind of DE razor that my dad used (some Gillette).  Around 17 the mach 3 came out and since the full knowledge of shaving was never really handed down to me, I opted for the mach 3 which was easy to use and gave a decent shave.  I've essentially stuck with the Mach 3 until now, but being generally unsatisfied with the closeness of my shave I decided to investigate and turned back to the safety razor picking up this Merkur HD.  I just used it for the first time and it turned out to be significantly more satisfying than I had hoped it would be.  I nicked myself a few times without really noticing so there's some learning curve but as of now I've only used it once and I can tell you that it won't take long to get it down. 

A couple thoughts:
1) I'm really glad that I went for an HD.  I thought the HD may be heavy (and it may be compared to other DE razors) but I wouldn't want it to be any lighter.  It already feels light in my hand.

2) The biggest thing to keep in mind about the shave is that the razor cuts by keeping it perpendicular to your skin.  The most notable difference between shaving with the Mach 3 v. the Merkur HD centered around this.  With the Mach 3 I kind of feel like I have to drag the blade across my skin (kind of scraping it) to get a close shave (which can be done and I don't notice that much irritation).  That said most of the shave with the HD was as close, but since the aim is to keep the blade perpendicular, the razor felt more like it was gliding over the skin. Very nice.

3) To put in a new blade you unscrew the bottom and the top part comes off.  You pop in the blade, put the top back on and screw the bottom to tighten the top.  

It should be noted that I've started shaving at night so that I can tell what I'm doing (I'm not a morning person) so in the morning if I'm not really going to pay attention the Mach 3 may still be better.  Also, I'm using cheap soap and a boar brush from CVS until the stuff I ordered comes in so with any luck it will be even nicer next time"

The oxygen peel drastically reduces the blotchiness and hyperpigmentation.  As soon as I rinse the stuff off my face I'm always amazed to look in the mirror and see the results.  This stuff does help keep your pores clean also.  I would recommend using this product every couple of weeks and DEFINATELY before a big event (pictures etc).  Basically you put a gel over your face and then add a hydrogen peroxide cream, the whole thing foams up, you wait 1-3 minutes (intense tingling experienced at times) and then rinse.  Some people say to 1/2 the amount recommended so the product last longer but I didn't really find it was worth it."

One thing, a day after the peel my skin looks a little red/blotchy in places but the day after that it's stunning so if you are indeed purchasing this for a wedding, etc. use it 2 days before the big day or else you might look like a splotchy bride.

Most of Philosophy's products are fabulous and if you're going to go for this, it works well with the Real Purity facial cleanser to use right after the peel, and then the Hope in a Jar moisturizer after that. "

I love the lasting power of the fragrant aura that envelops me the second I pray it on and the bottle looks absolutely breathtaking on my dresser. The scent itself is heady and aromatic, more floral and sophisticated than most tropical fragrance; I don't smell bananas and coconut here but soft orchid, pulpy woods, juicy plum and soft dewy honeysuckle with its sparkling golden nectar.

It's really a rainbow of happiness in a bottle. 

The top notes are Eden's Mist, Blue Hyacinth, Orange Flower Templar, Jabuticaba Fruit.
Middle notes are Laelia Orchid, Crepe Jasmin, Mahonia Japonica, Pink Honeysuckle balanced over a base of Natal Plum Blossoms, Ambrette Seed, Zebrano Wood, Golden Melaleuca Bark for a sweet and fruity concoction.

I sprayed CURVE onto myself when it arrived, and now I am comparing all of the new scents to my favorites so far, HUGO and CANDIES. My impression was that it was more serious than Hugo, had a sweetish overtone combined with musk, and then there was sort of a greenish bitter forest type scent to it that I wasn't crazy about. I think I may have been dissappointed at first, but that soon changed. After about fifteen minutes the smell got to be really good and the elements I hadn't liked were gone or had matured into subtle forms that went well together. 
After the speech I allowed the class to sample all of the colognes, and Curve was commented on the most, followed by Drakkar, then Hugo. All of the women liked it and seemed to have great associations with it, and for that I have to ensure that it gets the full 5 stars. I continue to wear it now later this same evening and it has quite grown on me. 
If you only bought Curve as your main cologne, you'd be quite alright. Subtle enough for casual wear and bright enough for clubbing. Overall good mix"

My skin cleared up in a week.  I didn't go through any purging that I could tell.  However, I started using the system right after a professional deep cleansing facial.

I recently got a facial on a cruise and the woman couldn't believe that I had problems with breakouts.  I would if I wasn't using my Murad.

I faithfully wash my face in the shower with the cleansing gel every morning.  Once or twice a week I use the AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser that I purchased separately.  I then apply the Acne Treatment Gel after I've dried off.  I follow with the moisturizer in the kit.  I do the same thing at night (except I'm not in the shower).  I almost never need the spot treatment now.  I have several tubes drying up in my cabinet.  I bought the mask separately too and used it a lot in the beginning but now I think the tube has dried up.  I haven't needed it in over a year.  I also used the vitamin supplements in the beginning.  However, since I do take vitamins anyway, I didn't really notice that they made a difference.  I also get a facial by a professional once and awhile to give my skin a boost.  However, since they are $$$ I tend to only get 2 or 3 a year.  Last year I only had one and my skin looked great. "

Mistral, as I was happy to discover, is also the name of a line of bath and body products, all French inspired, all lusciously lovely from scented soaps to soothing lotions to rejuvenating body butters. 

Matthew Tilker, founder and president of Mistral, utilizes Shea butter, which is an efficacious natural healer, in a myriad of must-have forms. Derived from the nuts of the African Shea Tree (according to sacred custom the nuts are harvested primarily by women), this butter is highly emollient, a boon for those with dry skin, chapped lips, any number of skin irritations. 

The pure Shea Butter soap comes in a plethora of inviting fragrances, all milled six times (while others boast being triple milled). South Seas is a particular favorite - it's as fresh as an ocean breeze and as calming, soothing as a tropical island. The marine scent is accented with a touch of grapefruit, white flowers and soft woods. An irresistible combination. 

South Seas is a fragrance with which you wish to surround yourself - made possible by the shower gel, body lotion, massage bath and body oil, bath salts and candle all available at very accessible prices.

I live in Hawaii, and the salt water and sun can take a beating to your skin, so I love this product!  It does an awesome job of exfoliating away dead and dry skin, and the essential oils in the bar give my skin it's moisture back.  Though like mentioned in other reviews, the almond pieces may be too rough for sensitive skin, and I wouldn't recommend this for daily use for anyone who has oily skin.  Once a week should be great.

The only thing I didn't care was the fact that Buffy did leave a slight coat of oil on my skin, and unless I was taking a really hot shower, my shower/tub floor was left feeling slick also.  I usually have to rinse again quickly with my soap, but this bar is a really nice skin conditioner for once-a-week treatments. I like to save the bar and use it when I have some time to relax for a while in the tub.  That way I'll do the bar right when I get in, and just let the essential oils absorb into my skin. I love it!

Still highly recommended"

Anything that saves me steps in the morning is a wonderful thing, and I love the idea that it's exfoliating and moisturizing in one. It's actually really difficult to describe the Buffy experience, but if you try this one, I'm sure you'll be hooked like me. The scent is yummy and unlike previous reviewers, I find that it lasts for a long time (although like all Lush products, you don't want to leave them sitting in the shower or tub - let them dry out after each use). I use Buffy on my legs in between shaving days, and I do an all over body scrub about once every week or two. Doing this, the small bar lasts about a month. I love that it's such a strong exfoliator, but someone with sensitive skin may need to go easy with Buffy"

So I used that stuff and it worked, but the smell and texture was dreadful. So over the years I've tested and tried multiple other things. And it's worked, but all left my skin kinda sticky, and not moisturized enough.

Then,.....I found this little miracle bar. It took care of all my skin issues, plus it felt good, plus is smelled good. And I have wonderful skin! AND (big and, because I have 2 small kids and no time)it eliminated 1 step from my shower routine (the lotion step). Seriously, you don't need lotion after this, as a matter of fact, worst case, I can go 2 days without moisturizing (2 small kids, lack of time again), and my skin still feels great.

This has been my daily moisturizer for several years. It makes my skin very soft, very healthy looking, and glowing. It makes me look radiant. I have given it as a gift to my sister and to other women, and they have all liked it as much as I have. No one has had any adverse reactions. You can notice a difference after just one use. When I've run out and used something else temporarily, I always can see the difference again once I start back up. It is as close as it gets to a miracle cream.

I do not wear makeup, so Hope In A Jar is it.  I am 49 years old and I think my skin looks incredible.  The friends I have given it to also like to keep a natural look and prefer their skin without heavy creams, thick moisturizers and sunscreens, or makeup. 

The women I know who are fans of Hope In A Jar are like me. We're kind of lazy no-fuss ""one cream that does it all"" people; instead of one jar of something for one thing, and another for something else---eye creams, night time moisturizers, daytime moisturizers, etc.---we're the type that wants just one that can do the job and then be done with it. In other words, we don't have the patience to fuss with our looks a lot, or to spend money buying bunches of different creams to keep track of and remember to use.

Unlike other reviewers, I love the smell, which is not perfumey, but definitely pleasantly distinctive. I use it around my eyes also, and have not had an allergic reaction.  It seems, though, that these are the two biggest problems with Hope---the distinctive odor and allergic reactions among some people.  I would suggest buying it the first time from somewhere you could return it if you don't care for it; although in my opinion, this would be unlikely, apparently it is possible. Philosophy now makes another version of Hope In A Jar for sensitive skin; if you know that your skin in tempermental, perhaps it would be better to also try this version. I have stuck with Hope In A Jar because it works so well for me. 

It seems expensive, but it is not because it lasts a long, long time.  The two-ounce jar lasts me about six months.  I use a toner and then Hope In A Jar and that's it.  I'm done with my face in 30 seconds. Plus, it gives me a look that most women use makeup to get, so I think it's a bargain.

Hope in a Jar leaves my skin with a clean yet moisturized feeling, and is a perfect base for foundation, as it is not greasy or oily.

The sensation was very cool and I was surprised how oily and slippery my feet were. I'm used to most feet creams sinking in and kind of dissapearing. 

So, my initial thought was pleasant, but kind of wierd. Now I have to say though, that as a soother and moisterizer it works great. My feet are are very soft and it works at the rough parts of me feet very well. I'm excited to try this with an exfoliater of some sort.

Pink Sugar makes me feel fabulous when I wear it; it's so light and `warm' with a base of sensual vanilla. I have the large bottle, body mousse & deodorent at home, and the smaller bottle in my handbag. I don't get bored with this fragrence, like I do with everything else I've tried over the years.

The first time I wore Pink Sugar to work one colleague commented on the aroma of drinking chocolate as I was in the lift with her. The next time I was in the lift, everyone commented on my lovely vanilla perfume. After I applied a freshen up spray, another colleague said she could smell cakes! Yet another colleague demanded to know what I was wearing, and where she could get some. Strangers come up to me in the street to ask what scent I'm wearing...

No this isn't a cheesy ad, it really happened!! 


What do I sense first? Liquorice, a rich aniseed scent that gradually settles into a middle note of caramel. Marshmallow is the first word that springs to mind to me. 

If you like Angel, Fantasy or Princess you need to give this a try!



 *Aquolina needs to make Pink Sugar available to the U.K. - Postage and packing costs a fortune!!! "

	The Mineral Eye Powders collection comes in six shades ranging from a soft almost nude to a midnight hue with blues and greens in between.  My current favorites are ""Milky Way"" - a moonlit sheen and ""Eclipse.""	

	When used dry these powders deliver a subtle shimmer all over  the eye; wet is your choice for added definition or to be used as a liner.

Hawkins ""Laura Wilde""",USA,"Think of it as loose eye shadow and eyeliner . . . with a kick. Laura Mercier Mineral Eye Powders are so incredibly versatile and can be applied wet or dry, as shadow or as liner, that it's possible to create endless different looks that range from casual and pretty to stunning and dramatic. Choosing to apply wet or dry will not only change to application but will give you beautifully different textures and definitions and degrees of sparkle.  

Using the mineral eye powder wet will make the color and look more intense and defined but will give it less sparkle. You'll also get an increase in the wear and the added option of using the powder as a liner. Using the powders dry will give them the most sparkle punch.

Laura Mercier Mineral Eye Powders come in six different shades -- two light colors: Milky Way & Galaxy and two intense colors: Meteor, Eclipse, Constellation, & Asteroid.

All Laura Mercier eye products are ophthalmologist and dermatologist tested.


Color Notes:

Milky Way - a very light, barely pink, opalescent color that will not only add silver toned sparkle but will lighten the feature or eye shadow color on which it is applied. Choose this color if you want to highlight and lighten.
 
Galaxy - a very light, barely grey-taupe color that will add gold tone sparkle but will otherwise blend into all but the darkest skin colors. Choose this color if you want the starstruck look but don't otherwise want to change your eye shadow color. This color will also work well on other areas of the face. Try putting just a dab in the inside corner of each eye for a real, yet subtle, eye pop.

Meteor - an intense color of green in the forest family with silver toned sparkle. Makes the most amazing eye liner color. 

Eclipse - an intense color of black with silver sheen. Makes a classic looking eyeliner color but with the updated twist of star struck sparkle.

Constellation - an intense color of purple that's similar to Laura's famous Black Violet Kohl Pencil. The sparkle on this one is gold tone. Women with green or hazel eyes will love how Constellation makes their eye color really pop. 

Asteroid - An intense color of dark blue with silver sheen. Makes a beautiful eye liner for brown and blue eyes and will help remove redness from the eyes of any shade. 


Basic ""how to use"" tips:
    * To line the eyes: dampen Wet/Dry Definer Brush with water, dip into one of the four darker shades, and mix to desired consistency. I like to use the back of my hand as a `palette' to mix the powder. To increase the shimmer, apply more powder on top of the eyeliner but this time use the brush dry. To further lengthen the wear of the powder as a liner, first line the eyes with one of Laura's Kohl Eye Pencils and then apply the powder on top.  This will also give your liner extra sheen.
    * To use as eye color: dampen Wet/Dry Definer Brush with water, dip into a darker shade and mix to desired consistency, once again using the back of the hand. Apply to eyelid and blend color with Ponytail Brush or apply directly to the eyelid with the dry brush- using wet leaves a sheen finish, using dry leaves a sparkly finish.

Fun ""how to use"" tips:
-Try Meteor as a shadow, lined with the Eclipse, and smudge Constellation all around for that smokey smudgy look.
-Cover your entire eyelid with Milky Way and line with Asteroid.
-Put dots of Galaxy in the inside corners of your eyes and just apply mascara"

Also, this seller was awesome when UPS for some reason thought I moved.  When I called Lush a live person answered the phone and called UPS for me.  UPS called me within 30 minutes and offered to bring it out that night.  Wonderful!!  My skin is oily with lg pores and blackheads - go ahead and give this a try if this sounds like your skin.

Herbalism is meant for oily skin; however I find it perfect for my combination skin.  It never leaves my skin dry or patchy, and throughout the day my skin has a nice matte look, thanks to the rice bran in the cleanser.  

I tried this as a sample and although it worked really well, I didn't care for the strong herbal scent of Herbalism and I didn't like the rose petals in the cleanser because they `got in the way' or just fell in the sink as I cleansed.  I prefer a cleanser with a more uniform consistency (like LUSH's Angels on Bare Skin; see my review), so I only buy Herbalism in small quantities (less than $5 amounts) and use it when my face is really feeling oily.  Other wise I use LUSH's Ocean Salt or Angels on Bare Skin as my nightly cleanser.

Still an overall great product!"

I would have normally declined her offer of a mini-make-over, but I was feeling rather adventurous and wanted to update some of my make-up items, so I followed her to her chair where she went to work on me.  

I have to say, in the past, I have been nonplussed and unimpressed with makeovers like these.  But when the rep handed me the mirror, I gasped.  Even under the harsh lighting, my complexion looked pretty darn flawless for a youthful grandmother trying to hold on to any vestige of good looks.  

I bought the foundation, along with the finishing powder and a few other Dior goodies.  I figured I would probably use it a few times and realize it didn't really look as good on me at home or in the office as it did when the Dior rep did my makeup in the store.  Then I would experience buyer's remorse and continue my quest for the perfect foundation. 

Lucky for me, I was wrong.  This product has become one of my top choices for foundation.  It doesn't settle in the fine lines around my eyes, or in my pores.  Instead, it does what it says -- smooths out my complexion. The color chosen for me looks natural with no lines of demarcation. And the coverage is what I prefer at this stage in my life.  

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I am still searching for this type of lush coverage that gives my combo skin less shine by mid-day.  But for now, I will finish using the bottle, and probably purchase another, which is something I haven't done with other foundations in some time.  

My biggest tip with this foundation is a little goes a long way.  The Dior rep used a make-up brush and that tends to give more of a sheer, even coverage.  At $50, it wouldn't seem to be a bargain, but if you use it as I've described, it should last you several months. "

I said ""Not me!"" before realizing that I WAS wearing some karma kream. I said so, and she asked where I'd gotten it. Phew! I was thinking someone had allergies or something and I was one of those people who was wearing too much perfume/lotion/whatever, oblivious to the fact that everyone around them was holding their nose. But she was actually really curious, and followed me past security so she could get the name of the store (Lush!) that sells this great stuff. 

Seriously, it's great! I've never in my life had anyone remark on any perfume or scented lotion I was wearing until I found karma kream, which I received as a sample in a recent order of Lush goodies. Now strangers, relatives, and friends are all asking me where they can get some of this stuff. 

The karma scent is really, really great - citrusy, with a tiny hint of lavendar, pine, and patchouli. You won't smell like a dirty hippie, though, trust me. The patchouli and pine are just bass notes to the main players - orange flower water, citrus, and lavendar scents. So fresh! It's great. Really wakes me up in the morning, and refreshes me during the day if I put some on.

This lotion won't leave your skin feeling greasy, either, like so many moisturizers can. My skin is really thanking me for discovering Lush products. If you want a subtle perfume but don't want something as strong as a concentrated perfume, this lotion is great, and as an added benefit, it will moisturize your skin while you're wearing it! And if you want a light perfume, you can put some karma kream on your neck, arms, or legs to have just a hint of scent."

If you'd like the effect to be beautiful, soft, touchable, kissable, skin, just smooth on Karma Kream.

	One other effect caused by Karma Kream is a delightful lingering fragrance.  Those nearing  the nape of your neck with notions  of nuzzling  may not be able to identify the subtle bouquet - they'll only know it's irresistible, this blend of Orange Flower Water, Lavender Oil, Lemongrass, Patchouli and other good scents.

	It's said that more people in the world believe in karma than do not.  Hmmmmm, don't know about that.  But, I do know that all of us want good karma and that's  Karma Kream.

	There now, apply Karma Kream before bedtime and rest well secure in the knowledge that your skin will be softer in the morning, and some day your Prince will come.

KEEP IT SIMPLE-An Active 37 Year Old Male Says ADIOS ACNE and HELLO FRESH & NEW SKIN!,"October 21, 2005","Peter V. Cannice ""Peter Vincent Cannice of Scottsdale Arizona""","Scottsdale, Arizona USA","Although most every fitness magazine I read has at least 2 articles about ""Health and Beauty/Grooming"", I'm still pretty certain that we're, Most Men in General, still in the woods in regard to proper skin care. The times are changing, more rapidly than ever before, and the need for separating the good, the bad and the ugly is HERE!

I'm a fairly active 37 year old male with fairly nice skin, although my Italian heritage prediposes my olive skin to being much oilier than I'd like. I have small areas of ""Combination Skin"", in addition to my generally oily skin type, which has often been more difficult to manage than anything else. Gone are the days of Vaseline and generic cleansers and moisturizers. Welcome are the days of skin products designed for treat and maintain almost any possible skin type. 

My review is submitted, as I, too, had no idea that ""Philosophy"" was anything other than one of the hardest classes I ever surived through in College! When I told my close friend, an aspiring and very beautiful female model and actress, that she REALLY had a youthful glow and joked about her having ""Some cosmetic work done!"", she accepted it quite well and with a big southern smile. She told me that it wasn't plastic surgery and it wasn't any high-tech laser procedure or over-priced exfolliant scrub. Instead, she said she was on the run and would stop by to visit with myself and my spouse after dinner.

Karin came over with a bag full of goodies, everything from home-baked chocolate chip and almond cookies to a gift certificate for a nice eatery in town (since I had mowed her lawe and few times)! But that wasn't the end of the gifts. She proceeded to give us 2 Philosophy Skin Care Products. My spouse had heard of them in a recent review in a popular magazine, but it was all brand new to me. Karin said that it was a gift for both of us and she wanted us both to use the exfoliator AND the moisturizer too. My spouse was thrilled to death with the new ""products"" and I was more thrilled (at that time) with the warm chocolate chip cookies.

Before bed we started to use the 2 products. Applying quality products was not new to me and over the years I've spent a few thousand in quality products to reduce my oily skin that often lead to acne-even after I turned 30. I didn't expect anything other than the ordinary smoothe and clean feeling after exfoliating, combined with the relaxed and cooling feel of the moisturizer. BOY-What a surprise I was in for!!

This is not a joke and I am not here with any special interest-other than to give a totally honest review of these products. My skin, in just 3 weeks, went from oily (with some combination areas) to normal and from shiny to glowing. Most impressive of all, was that (without any sort of drying effect on my skin) my facial acne is 90% gone. And I'll be truthful in telling you, in this review, that when my face is clear and looks good, I FEEL GOOD TOO!

I didn't have severe acne, but it was enough to consistently bother me and surprise me when I least needed an ""outbreak!""
I'm sold on these products and am online to purchase products for my Mom and her 2 Sisters in New York. I used to work as a professional actor and model, mostly doing television commercials and some print work. So I've tried just about everything and I've had some luck with other products-but NOTHING like the overall masculine and finsihed look that Philosophy Products brought to me. I'm 100% sold and I hope that this review was helpful to you. It's from mmy heart and it's the truth. I hope and pray that you have similar or even better results that I have experienced. Good Luck To You! You won't be unhappy with these products, all of which are under a great satisfaction guarantee (another reason I tried them)!

Let me know how it works out!

	He's no longer laughing, he's using MY soap!  Neither masculine nor feminine the scent of Sea Vegetable is  totally refreshing, laced with lavender and lime oils.   Do believe he's thinking of becoming a pirate as he sings away in the shower, sudsing with MY soap.  Remember what it's like to walk along a beach when the day is fresh and new?  That's reminiscent of this fragrance.

	Deep blue in color the soap is topped with a wave of Atlantic sea salt crystals - so invigorating!  It gives the skin a bit of a tingle and softens at the same time.

        There he goes again - singing at the top of his lungs.  Well, I have a refrain for him: ""Yo, ho, ho, matey!  Forget that bottle of rum and buy me another wedge of Sea Vegetable!"

The results are much more precise, longer lasting and smoother. But I was still getting those big ugly ingrown hairs. So the wax technician gave me a couple sample bottles of TendSkin. There was a noticable difference after 24 hours but I still had quite a few bumps remaining. I don't know if it was because I'm so suspectible to ingrown hairs or because I had so many to start with but it took a couple of months for my bikini area to completely clear up with twice daily application of TendSkin. I also exfoliate my bikini area several times a week - exfoliation will go a long way in preventing ingrown hairs. With the exfoliation and the daily application of TendSkin, the ingrown hairs are completely gone. I now use TendSkin only once a day and that is sufficient. My bikini area has never looked better. My only gripe with TendSkin is the cost - I put off buying a bottle for the longest because it's so expensive. I have one of the small 4 ounce bottles that I found at the less expensive price of $13 but that's still a bit much for this product. I'll continue to buy it because it works but it'd be nice if it were a little cheaper.

And for those who are wondering about the rubbing alcohol smell, I found that on me it disappeared as soon as the TendSkin dried. So don't let the smell of it deter you - if you are prone to ingrown hairs, TendSkin is the product for you. And to help it along, it's also a good idea to exfoliate the area regularly. :"

I have Warm Sand Moisture Rich Foundation. It is incredibly smooth, long wearing and the color makes my skin look bright and radiant. Bobbi Brown makes very natural foundation colors and there is a range of colors for all different skin tones. When I'm shopping it seems that most lines cater to lighter and medium skin tones, but Bobbi Brown really does come through with flattering options for all skin tones. The only draw back is that this foundation does not provide adequate SPF protection, even though it says SPF 15. Therefore, you will still need to wear a sunscreen underneath of at least SPF 15. I use this foundation every day and I wear sunscreen from Paula's Choice (which I love).

The reason for the 4/5 stars is two things.  Sometimes the smell is a little overwhelming.  This is entirely a personal preference, and is only something that happens some of the time.  The other reason is that the balm tends to not last very long on me, and I find that a little annoying.

Rice Bran is the secret to these products and the results are immediately apparent in the texture of your skin. After just one to two uses, you start to notice a sense of calm and order descending upon your formerly sensitive skin. 

If you have oily or combination skin, you may be amazed at how balanced your skin is and how you no longer experience the shine breakthrough in your makeup due to the initially drying aspects of other cleansers. 

1. The Komenuka Bijin Facial Cleansing Foam is very economical and an eighth of a teaspoon is enough for a wonderful face cleansing experience. The ingredients include: Rice Germ Oil, Rice Bran, Coconut Oil, Seaweed, Aloe Algae, Ginkgo Biloba, Matricaria, Yeast, Perilla Ocymoides, Honey, Lithospermum and Fountain Water. 

2. Follow the cleanser with the Komenuka Bijin Skin Lotion and you may wonder why you are suddenly catching the scent of SAKE. In fact, this cleansing toner does contain SAKE along with Rice Bran, Seaweed, Aloe, Yeast, Glycyrrhizate, Orange, Lemon, Matricaria, Algae, Luffa Cylindrica and Fountain Water. The toner completes the process of removing impurities and also has the added benefit of contracting the pores so they look smaller. Men may also enjoy this as an aftershave lotion. If the toner is not included, they normally include the NS-K Special Toner with even more healing ingredients. 

3. The Moisture Cream goes a long way. The main oils are Rice Germ Oil, Jojoba Oil and Olive Oil. Vitamin E, Rice Bran and Aloe make this a skin-healing treat. 

4. Eye Moisture Jell - Also contains apple acid, lemon, seaweed and loquat leaf. Smooths the delicate eye area. 

5. Makeup Remover - A fragrance-free cream that removes makeup and mascara. Based on olive oil. 

6. Two Cleansing Powder Packets - Deep cleansing grains turn silky and creamy when you add water. 

7. The UV Cream is slightly tinted and waterproof. This sunblock also seems to even out skin tone. Could be used as a makeup base if you are looking for a more natural look. The cream is easy to apply and absorbs easily into the skin. You can apply this on its own or after the moisture cream and skin essence. 

8. Skin Care Cream - A body cream that is very healing with jojoba oil. 

9 & 10. Hair Shampoo & Conditioner - Thickens fine hair instantly. Removes buildup and leaves your hair feeling luxurious. 

If you are looking for an easy way to try out the skincare system or you just want to take these products with you wherever you go (they are addictive), then I can highly recommend this and any of the Komenuka products. I love how calm they make me feel. These products cover all bases and whether you live in a cold, dry or humid climate, your skin will feel protected. 

Other products to fall in love with: 

The Skin Essence contains Mulberry that naturally lightens discoloration from sun damage and aging. The antioxidants help to revitalize the skin. This is applied before the cream. 

Moisture Cream Silver - Super hydration with aloe, vitamin E and Rice Bran.

The gel is so thick and supple with bath beads that your body will thank you for it.  The mango aromoa will lift your senses first thing in the morning and get you ready for the day!  I have to hide this stuff or my children will use it all up  -  they like to squeeze the gel out and pop the beads inside.

I suggest this bath gel if you want to give yourself a shower or bath treat.  It's well worth the money and would be a great addition to a ""relaxation"" gift basket for a friend"

The exotic gardenia fragrence will put you in a trance as you float through your day... imagining yourself next to the Four Seasons pool instead of in a carpool with your children and their friends!  

I purchased this in Tiburon, CA on our way home from Napa last year and I've found myself reliving that initial moment when I first sprayed it on in the boutique.  My friends and I all melted at the aroma.  I've used it everyday since and have purchased more for myself and some as gifts for others!

I love to take my morning shower, towel dry and spritz this all over!  My senses are heightened and I'm off for a day filled with whatever -- it really wouldn't matter what took place b/c I feel so fresh and flirty -- ready to take on the day!

I highly suggest you make the purchase now and stop waiting for something to push you over the edge! "

It has definitely helped my acne-prone oily skin look more refined and toned. The only caveat to the product is that it mildly stings after you put it on.

The sales lady talked me into letting her put the rouge on my cheeks in the color - pale pink.  Wow it made me look so good. It made me look like I was glowing or flushing from the inside there was no telltale marks of blush on my face. I bought it on the spot. This did not have as great effect on my lips, it looked like I had lipstick on, but I'll just use it on my cheeks. I highly recommend this product."

It was enough scent for 3-4 baths, but that wouldn't have been enough bubbles, so I used it for 2 baths that smelled VERY strongly! 

Not really a very relaxing scent, more of a refreshing, up-and-at-'em morning scent. It will definitely wake you up. The patchouli smell, which I love, is stronger in this bubble bar than in other Lush products. 

Suggestion: I would combine this with a karma bath bomb (also has a hint of patchouli scent) for a great combination of smells! 

The blue skies bubble bar WILL turn your bath water a scary blue color, but that's ok, because it smells good and leaves your skin silky smooth with its essential oils"

I have always had oily skin and those little bumps on my forehead--but my biggest problem was blackheads on my cheeks/nose and those painful red bumps that always show up when I shave.  After only a week or so of being on the Acne Complex, I IMMEDIATELY noticed a reduction in the post-razor bumps as well as the little red bumps on my forehead.  And the refining mask is AMAZING!  Let it sit on your face for 10 minutes and you'll be amazed at how it makes blackheads DISAPPEAR.  Plus, Murad's formula doesn't have any of that drying benzoyl peroxide, which means no irritation, no drying, and no bleaching the collars of your expensive shirts.  If you've got acne problems, you owe it to yourself to give Acne Complex a try"
