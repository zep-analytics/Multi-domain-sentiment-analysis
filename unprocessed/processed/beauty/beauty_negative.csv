I thought I could use this every other day and get by. 

However, it doesn't make your hair look freshly washed; it is just ok.  It takes ""bed head"" hair and makes it look acceptable for a little while.  After a couple of hours though, my hair looks oily and stringy again.

I use it before I take the kids to school and it gets me thru the morning.  Then I end up washing my hair later"

The conditioner feels like vegetable shortening or softened butter. Need to use more than average. The conditioner is average in detangling and after using it four times it does condition your hair, but no better than other quality brands. I do like that it seems to cut down on the drying time, but Bed Head has a similar product that's been out for a while. For that option I would rather choose Bed Head for quality and price"

For example, even in the hot, very humid atmosphere of Houston, TX it left my hair feeling dry and unhealthy, even after using his conditioner (alot of it). My hair looks awful after using it. And the bottle claims that it doesn't use toxic ingredients like MEA but it DOES use three different types of PEG, a petroleum based thicker found in most bath products that can erode wooden tables in just minutes. This is just as harmful as MEA, especially for people with sensitive scalps and hair. And it claims not to strip your hair but the products that are supposed to cleanse are much less apparent in the product than the PEG products. Since PEG is a thickener, you're also getting a diluted, toxic, solution. Even though Head and shoulders uses MEA I find that that even that works better than this. My hair doesn't feel like it has any more of its essential oils and I've switched back to the other hair products Iv'e been using. It's not worth your 20 dollars, its barely worth 5 dollars. My hair stylist also recommended Dove products if you need hydration. DON'T BUY IT!"

In the long run it is damaging for the hair and after some hours it really does not have that nice clean bounce that hair is supposed to have.
Jonathan is not the only good product out there. I have been using Phyto Shampoo from France and Kiehl's, both don't have the silicon smoothers either and yes, the hair does feel like straw right after you wash it. Get a big tooth comb and some guts and go through life with really clean hair!!!!

For example, even in the hot, very humid atmosphere of Houston, TX it left my hair feeling dry and unhealthy, even after using his conditioner (alot of it). My hair looks awful after using it. And the bottle claims that it doesn't use toxic ingredients like MEA but it DOES use three different types of PEG, a petroleum based thicker found in most bath products that can erode wooden tables in just minutes. This is just as harmful as MEA, especially for people with sensitive scalps and hair. And it claims not to strip your hair but the products that are supposed to cleanse are much less apparent in the product than the PEG products. Since PEG is a thickener, you're also getting a diluted, toxic, solution. Even though Head and shoulders uses MEA I find that that even that works better than this. My hair doesn't feel like it has any more of its essential oils and I've switched back to the other hair products Iv'e been using. It's not worth your 20 dollars, its barely worth 5 dollars.

Honestly, I wanted a good flat iron and I thought this was a good product because it was expensive...BIG MISTAKE.  My friend bought a straight iron for about $100 and she's had it for almost a year.  She also straightens her hair a lot more often than I do.  I don't know why I didn't ask her where she got hers.  Please read all the reviews before you make this purchase.  If you don't believe me, wait to see if someone you know buys it so you can find out first hand how bad this product is. "

Andis is a good brand of clipper, ""however"" $80 for this pair of clippers is $70 too much. The power is weak and it takes about 24 hours to fully charge. 

These clippers are not designed for professional use at all. I am not a barber, my wife cuts my hair every 2 weeks or so. It does a decent fade job and my 2 boys(3 and 4) are mixed and seems to cut through their hair with a little more ease than mine. 

However it seems that my past corded clippers had more power which translate to easier cutting and trimming. My wife has to constantly go over various spots multiple times because it did not hit the spot the first or 2nd time.

My recommendation is to do your research and go with another pair of Andis clippers, stay away from this pair, or you'll be finding yourself writing a review saying I agree with the first guy that reviewed this product"

I used Stay Beige (which I lightly patted on my face on top of Clinique's superfit liquid makeup - I have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. I also hated how Clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades, so that I had to settle for Honey in the liquid and Beige in the powder. As much as I went back to Macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades, they just wouldn't listen. Either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade, or they were convinced I was making a big deal out of nothing. Instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which I shouldn't have to do in the first place) I just switched to a different makeup line: Laura Mercier, which I am VERY happy with.

I've had many other friends who were unhappy with Clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand, as well. I'm not trying to knock the product. I'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people I know. I would definitely NOT recommend Clinique to anyone.

First of all, I gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. However, this product is sticky. VERY sticky! It does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. Not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. When I wear a lip gloss, I want to be soft and smooth feeling. I want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak. 

Also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. This will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. Very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!

Clinique Facial Soap with dish
Clinique Clarifying Lotion 2
Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion


About the same time I started using the Clinique 3-step system, I began wearing foundation for the first time. I found that my skin started breaking out and began to be dry in some spots. I stopped using the foundation after about 3 months because I thought that was the issue. However, my skin problems did not improve and I even moved down a level in the Clinique system to one for more sensitive skin.

However, after about 7 months of daily use, my skin was not improving and I found a review of the Clinique 3-step System from Paula Begoun. Her research indicates that all of Clinique's facial soaps in the 3-Step System are too irritating for all skin types. Her research also stated that all Clarifying Lotions (1-4) contain alcohol and Clarifying Lotion 2 contains menthol which make them too irritating for all skin types. 

I never thought that my skin care products were the cause of my flaky skin and break outs. Apparently, the products dried out my skin making it flaky in some areas and in response, my skin started producing more oil to compensate for the dryness-which made me break out in other areas. I switched to Paula's Choice facial products and I occasionally use Cetaphil. After I made the switch, my skin slowly began recovering. 

Unfortunately, now I have some acne scars on my cheeks as a result of using the Clinique 3-step system. It makes me sad because before, my skin was healthy and for the most part clear. I do want to be fair to Clinique. They have some great products---I use their City Block Sheer SPF 15, Advanced Stop Signs Eye SPF 15 and I wear Clinique Happy perfume which smells amazing. 

I hope this review proves helpful to other women so you don't have to go through what I went through! Clinique does have some great products in their line, but they do need to  reformulate their 3-Step Skin Care System."

The reviews here have all stated that this is a cute keychain, that the gloss is nice and that the colors are pretty. All very true. I got my keychain in the Pixie tones and they're girly and pretty and I was feeling pretty cool about it. However, for me, the disenchantment came with the mechanics of it. 

Now, I've always been a fairly careful person, I'm not klutzy nor do I drop or lose things. My keys are as normal as a standard set of keys can be, I never dropped them or banged them against stuff any more that's normal and yet, after less than a week the keychain hinges had broken twice. The first time I was able to make a little mess of superglue and scotch tape and managed to rescue it and put it back into almost normal condition, the second time however, I only noticed that the entire thing had fallen completely apart because I saw only half of the keychain remained and my keys were all covered in pink goo. 

How did it come apart like this? I honestly have no idea as my keys had only made the very normal trajectory between the ignition and my purse. I can honestly only chalk it up to really, really shoddy craftsmanship which may be adequate for a dresser-top lipgloss but never for something that could get even remotely more movement than that. It was a good idea but too low-quality to be fit for the purpose of a keychain. This is not the way to go for gloss on your keys"

I am a SJP-fan, and I was almost certain I would love the new perfume of this stylish lady.
It isn't released yet in Holland, but I found a sample in Germany where it is already released. I was disappointed. The smell isn't bad, but it's isn't something I would like to smell like. It isn't lovely at all. It is too sporty. I expected something more flowery. The scent reminded me most of deodorant (cheap brands) or toilet-refreshener. So, although I am a SJP-fan, I wouldn't like to smell like her. A pity.
My favourite perfumes are (as a comparison): Beyond Paradise (Estee Lauder), Curious (Britney Spears), Couture! (Moschino), Live (J.Lo), Tumulte (Christian LaCroix), several Escade Limited Edition Perfumes and Gucci Rush 2"

Well, I was NOT impressed.  The scent is so strong and overwhelming that it actually seemed to ""catch"" in my throat.  I accidentally got some on my hand and after four hand washings I could still smell it.  I guess, for those of you who like this perfume, that's probably a good thing.

Anyway, I think this perfume is too ""old lady"" for my taste.  It reminded me of J. Lo's Glow.  Which I also have and don't like.

For comparisons sake, perfumes I do like are Britney Spears' Curious, Clinique Happy, Escada Island Kiss and Lucky You"

Application is difficult, mistakes are almost impossible to correct even if done immediately, and I can't soften the line (it *is* smudgeproof).  If you are used to a brush-on-liquid-liner, have a very steady hand, and want a dramatic look, this might work for you.  I prefer a softer line, so this didn't.

Also, it almost completely flaked off over the course of the day.

I'm giving it two stars because it really is smudge-proof, no sliding or transferring.  I didn't have the dark shadows from smudging but I did have flakes, so I'm still not happy with it.

I had been using Clinique for years, merely because it was affordable and a lot of people I knew used it. However, every time I took pictures I couldn't help but cringe after I saw the way my face looked. I'm a naturally tan person, but when I wore Clinique's foundation (I used Honey 07) it would make my face look extremely pale and ghostly, compared to the rest of my body. It got to the point where I got so upset that I went back to the Clinique counter at Macy's and insisted this just couldn't be the right color for me. They insisted it was the correct color and didn't even bother trying new shades on me, even though I had gone back a couple different times. 

Overall, I was really miserable with this product. As a lady, I want to look my best. I definitely don't want to look like someone who doesn't know how to put her makeup on, but whenever I took pictures and saw the way I looked, I couldn't help but think everyone was thinking that. 

For those of you who may be having my same problem, I recommend switching over to Laura Mercier. I made the switch and it's been the best makeup decision of my life. My face has never looked better"

I have used Fekkai products before, and their okay.  Certainly not worth the over inflated price tag.  But I read the reviews for this product and thought it might be the perfect solution for my hair during the winter months.  Wrong answer!  This product is very thick, too thick for me to spread through my hair without putting some work into it.  Conditioners and hair masks should be well, conditioning.  I left this hair mask in the required 20 minutes, and it did nothing.  In fact, I had to go back through my hair with my $6.00 Pantene conditioner just to make my hair manageable.  I also have to wonder what the purpose is of putting pieces of nut shells into a product that is supposed to condition hair?  All those pieces are going to do is rough up your hair cuticle.

I have very thick, coarse, wavy hair and trying to manage it is a nightmare! Before using Fekkai's Luscious Curls lotion, I was using Aveda's Be Curly Lotion and Matrix's Curl.Life contouring creme. Both of the latter products work very well with my hair. I don't like to blow dry my hair (too time-consuming), so I just air dry it. Without blow drying, whether I'm using Aveda or Matrix, the results are great! My hair is smooth, shiny, and less frizzy.

I had never used Fekkai's products before, but decided to give this one a try. Everything Luscious Curl Enhancing Lotion claimed to do, didn't do for my hair. In fact, it actually made my hair worst! It became stiffer, drier looking, frizzier. In addition, my wavy hair, (usually bouncy and alive), became flat and dull. Also, I didn't like the scent of this particular curling lotion. It was very strong smelling and made me nauseous.  

Because of my very poor experience with Fekkai's Luscious Curls lotion, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I think I'll stick to the Aveda and Matrix curling lotions, since they are much more compatible with my hair."

A friend of mine all of a sudden looks 10 years younger, beautiful, glowing poreless skin without needing any foundation so I asked her what she was using.  This was one of her key products and she said it took about 2 months for the effect to really be noticeable.  

Unfortunately I can't use it enough to find out.  First I tried appplying it around my eyes, on my forehead and above my upper lip.  I broke out in really deep cystic acne in those areas after about 4 days.  I started relegating the application only to the eye area and even that is now having a horrible reaction.  I look like I've got insect bites under my eyes, or like I've been punched out.  Yuck.  It's gotta be some kind of allergic reaction.

I used Stay Beige (which I lightly patted on my face on top of Clinique's superfit liquid makeup - I have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. I also hated how Clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades, so that I had to settle for Honey in the liquid and Beige in the powder. As much as I went back to Macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades, they just wouldn't listen. Either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade, or they were convinced I was making a big deal out of nothing. Instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which I shouldn't have to do in the first place) I just switched to a different makeup line: Laura Mercier, which I am VERY happy with.

I've had many other friends who were unhappy with Clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand, as well. I'm not trying to knock the product. I'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people I know. I would definitely NOT recommend Clinique to anyone. I'd rather pay a little more and get better results rather than settle for a $20 product just because it's affordable."

Larosa,,"Any manufacturer that doesn't fully label their product should not be trusted. I do not see a list of ingredients here (but most nail polishes don't bother to do this anyway). The problem I see is this...this nail polish totes that it's safe to use during pregnancy due to the fact that it doesn't contain the above ingredients, but what DOES it contain instead? If it wears well, doesn't peel, give good color coverage, it's got to contain something in the offending ingredient's place, logically. 

Please ask yourself this before you sigh relief and Add to Basket! Phthalates, for example, are a class of industrial plasticizers that were invented in the 1930s. They are often used in nail polish because they make nail polish flexible, and they are used in other products because they help bleed the chemicals of fragrances and help lotion better penetrate the skin. They aren't required to be labeled on the products. Lab animals given dibutyl phthalate had higher numbers of offspring with birth defects, especially of the male reproductive system. A nail polish may not contain phthalates (and brag about it), but may contain a related plasticizer that essentially is just as harmful. Does this contain phthalic anhydride, a toxic chemical hardener? How about FD&C color, such as Yellow 5? It's a petroleum-based color that is also questionable when it comes to safety. 

Basically put, no nail polish is safe during pregnancy. On top of that, while your at it you should review every lotion, foundation product, etc that you use if you're concerned about things like this. I think it's great to be careful - more power to you - but be fully informed, not partially. Companies prey on our worst fears, and what is worse than harming our babies? If this product is so great, let's see an ingredients list (and all cosmetics should do the same, while I'm sounding off on the subject!) "

I should have been suspicious when on the label it says you can make pudding from this as well...which should have alerted me right off the bat that there are other ingredients in the tin--not just chocolate and some sugar...it must be cornstarch.

Marie Belle makes a big deal of the fact that this is NOT cocoa, but cacao...that's why I fell for the hype...but in the end, it's the flavor that counts, and this one...I guess because of the corn starch...has a strange ""mouth feel"" and flavor that I find unpleasant.

I find the French brand  L'Ancienne  far superior...and my favorite drinking chocolate is 
Charbonnell et Walker, which is not for sale (yet) on Amazon"

Since they don't sell Chocolovers anywhere near where I live I decided to order it from Sephora.com in the US.  First of all I thought the price was fairly reasonable for 1.7oz bottle (a very nice bottle and package, if I might add), it cost me around $50 CDN.  I was so excited when my order came in today that I quickly opened up the bottle and gave it a sniff.  Ahhh the sickeningly sweet smell of disappointment.  I don't know what I had been expecting, maybe something more like milk chocolate, but what I got was a strong citrus/cocoa powder burst fading into a VERY strong and sweet smell almost like turkish delights or raspberries and chocolate with a hint of musk.  This may sound good, but for as much of a fan of sweet candy/foody smells as I am, I found this one too overpowering and it seriously made me sick.  Right now all I can smell is a sickly sweetness and the smell of flat Seven Up.  On the plus side it has stopped completely my cravings for sweets.  I think if I were trying to diet I would wear this scent everyday.  I think I will keep it in the hopes that it will grow on me because I really love the look of the bottle and the box it came in.  I am also going to try and layer it with a cocoa body lotion in hopes that it will tame down some of the sweetness.  The bottom line is try before you buy"

I was super excited because I thought to myself, ""shoot, one pass instead of two...""  Not quite.  For starters the razor is bulking and plain heavy.  And not the kind of heavy I'm comfortable with trying to shave as I shouldn't feel I might drop the darn thing.  I started on 1 the first day to get a handle on the razor.  Not a good shave, missed alot of spots and patches of hair.  So day two I went to level 2 on the razor.  Same story, second verse.  It left patches and didn't shave well in some areas.  2.5 the areas got smaller but still...they were there.  Went to a 3 setting on the razor and almost mangled myself.  So for the next week I went back to a 2.5 and did it more consistantly, still gave me a crappy shave.  I give this one star because if it's supposed to be a better razor than anything before it, there shouldn't be a learning curve from one double edge to another.  At least not one this severe.  I get a way better shave using my merkur classic and I really think at least for me, this is the way to go.  I say use caution on the Merkur Futur.  I also say if you're already getting a good shave with a double edge you have, don't buy a new style for the sake of buying a new style.  If you're double edge gets old...buy a new one of the same kind.  Only a suggestion. "

She said that while it lathered nicely, it felt like it stripped her hair and when it rinsed out, it left her hair overly 'squeeky' and tangled.  The end result once her hair was dried (after using conditioner, too), was that it was a lighter shade of blonde, very fly-away, and dry feeling.  She was hoping for smoother, easier to manage hair.  We debated purchasing this shampoo because of its high cost, and I have to say we are extremely disappointed.  The claims were hype, and the results were not delivered.  Her hair was by no means 'fried' or severely damaged, so I fully expected her to have some more manageable locks after using the product, based on its claims.

I remember it smelling great and being endorsed by celebrities as the ""it"" shampoo for treating dry, unruly tresses. The other day, I saw this shampoo on the clearance shelf at Meijers and regrettably made an impulse purchase.  Even at clearance price, this shampoo was still expensive. 

I have very thick, wavy, and somewhat dry hair that needs lots of conditioning products--when I checked out the ingredients (after I bought the shampoo), I groaned inwardly. Almost all of the ingredients (with the exception of water) is on the Aubrey Organics' ""ingredients to be avoided"" list (that is, they are considered toxic).  Like Aubrey Organics, other reputable natural beauty manufacturers suggest avoiding parabens as preservatives because they are mildly estrogenic and can be absorbed through the skin. This shampoo has six different types of parabens--methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc.     

If a product has such a steep asking price, then you would think that its manufacturers would put forth a better formula, incorporating non-toxic, natural ingredients (like Aveda, Biolage, and Biosilk).  At least Suave and V05 (bargain-priced shampoos) can boast about having vitamins and silk amino acids in their formulas (though many of their other ingredients are also found on the ""to be avoided"" list).

The one thing I will say for it is that the color blended well with my skin. In the bottle it looked like it would be way too dark, so I was surprised by that. It looks like there might be a little wiggle room as far as choosing the correct shade with this one. The coverage is not very good, though. You can put a little extra on without it looking cakey, but it doesn't cover as well as say Lancome's Photogenic foundation. I also highly doubt that it is waterproof. Water-resistant, maybe. Defintely not waterproof. It rubbed off pretty easily with a dry kleenex and even more came off with a wet one. When I tried CoverBlend's water resistant makeup I had to use soap to get it off. The coverage was also much better. Unfortunately they don't offer many shades in the Leg & Body Makeup. I also found that the dew finish did not work for my skin. I have combination skin and tend to have a shiny t-zone. This foundation left me with a shiny nose and forehead. It also made the rest of my face feel slightly oily, which it normally does not. Overall I would say this foundation is a very poor value and I will defintely be returning it to Sephora. At least Sephora has free returns. :"

First of all, I gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. However, this product is sticky. VERY sticky! It does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. Not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. When I wear a lip gloss, I want to be soft and smooth feeling. I want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak. 

Also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. This will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. Very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!

I couldn't figure out why the box was so heavy.  They are just socks, right?  Right??  Well, they aren't.  The insides are coated with some sort of heavy-duty silicone.

Hence the soft feet.  And very warm feet.  They'll be good for winter.

The other gripe I have is that they don't come with washing instructions.  Great.  These socks have one purpose in life, and that is to make your feet sweat and then refuse to be washed.  I found that handwashing them in the sink with some handsoap works fine.  For now, anyway.  I don't think they belong in the washing machine.  A laundry horror story is likely to ensue.    "

I used Stay Beige (which I lightly patted on my face on top of Clinique's superfit liquid makeup - I have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. I also hated how Clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades, so that I had to settle for Honey in the liquid and Beige in the powder. As much as I went back to Macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades, they just wouldn't listen. Either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade, or they were convinced I was making a big deal out of nothing. Instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which I shouldn't have to do in the first place) I just switched to a different makeup line: Laura Mercier, which I am VERY happy with.

I've had many other friends who were unhappy with Clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand, as well. I'm not trying to knock the product. I'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people I know. I would definitely NOT recommend Clinique to anyone. I'd rather pay a little more and get better results rather than settle for a $20 product just because it's affordable."

First of all, I gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. However, this product is sticky. VERY sticky! It does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. Not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. When I wear a lip gloss, I want to be soft and smooth feeling. I want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak. 

Also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. This will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. Very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!

Rinse with warm water. Careful not to get it in your eyes, as I did once while rinsing it off in the shower. This scrub does an adequate job of exfoliating and retexturizing skin. But it's unsuitable for sensitive skin, and it stinks to high heaven. It contains menthol, which burns skin and clears the sinuses at no extra charge. Having so much menthol so close to my nose is not a good thing. Of course, it is ""100% Fragrance Free"" according to Clinique, meaning that the smell of menthol is unadulterated by perfumes. The scrub also contains salicylic acid, so beware that this might be too drying for some skin types, especially if used frequently. The performance isn't bad. The olfactory aesthetics are atrocious.

The original product while greasy and a bit of a pain to use, exfoliates almost as well as professional microdermabrasion and does not irritate - even with daily use. A few years ago I spent the summer neglecting to use my sun block. Needless to say, my skin became a mess (dull, blotchy, discolorations, rough, flaky, etc.). I began my basic Clinique regimen (Mild Facial Soap, Clarifying lotion #2, Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion, and the Seven Day Srub). In less than two weeks I saw a huge difference, my skin was back to normal. I had tried the Exfoliating Scrub later, since I hated to deal with the original ""seven day"" but soon went back to it as it truly works best.

That was all fine and dandy, but it didn't leave my nails all that dry, nor did it leave them shiny. In fact, they were less shiny than the shiny topcoats I use. 

I also had the worse case of bedsheet wrinkles embedded in my manicure that night after using this product - could be unrelated, but I've never seen so many creases and smudges in my nails when I woke up and I let them dry for a few hours after painting them!

I've been unable to get any lather from this bar, although admittedly I do have very hard water where I live. I read that previous reviewers complained about how long this soap lasts.

The smell is a very strong herbal;  like the kind you would add to an Italian pasta dish.   Not very appealing!  There is some complexity to the scent, but it's so overshadowed by the herb smell to really come through.  On the plus side,  the color is beautiful (a rich, dark purple) and the lather is equally lovely to look at.  If you like true herbal scents, then you should give this a try.

I've been using drug store relaxers for over 30 years (CrÃ¨me of Nature, TCB, Dark & Lovely, Revlon Realistic) whatever is ""on sale"" with satisfying results.   These products leave my hair evenly straight and shiny but hard and stiff immediately after the process.  I usually wash my hair after a few days (I like to give it a rest after relaxing) and use a good conditioner to soften and detangle.  From there I am able to go about 12 weeks before having to retouch.  In general my hair is healthy and responds well to straightners.  My biggest expense is with conditioning products to maintain my hair.  I'll try anything and spend any amount if it works well on my hair.  I have great success with Frederic Fekkai products and love Phytodefrisant Botanical Hair Relaxing Balm...this stuff is amazing if you like to wash and go (air dry) and it works wonders with blow drying/flat ironing too.  (Bumble and Bumble Styling Spray is another amazing product for great flat ironing results.)

I forked out $60 to try Phtyo2 after reading all the rave reviews.  I am satisfied with the outcome but not blown away.  Yes, Phyto2 did not smell bad, it did not burn my scalp and it did straighten my hair but no better than Dark and Lovely or TCB, and my hair was still hard and stiff afterward.

It has been several weeks and my hair is doing great, but again no different from when I use Dark & Lovely.  I guess I am lucky that my hair responds well to ANY type of relaxer so I doubt I'll be spending another $60 for Phyto2...I'd rather buy two tubes of Phytodefrisant Balm and continue to with my $7.99 drug store brands.  I hope this helps someone with similar hair as mine.  If you do well with drug store brands, Phyto results are not that different...spend the money on their other products that nourish and condition your hair"

I bought it at a big upscale department store and used it that night.  Now that winter is approaching, my skin gets a little wacky at times.

The product comes out as a gel but becomes creamy as you apply it on the damp skin.  The instructions are to leave it on until a ""full froth"" forms (approximately 5 minutes), then rinse off.

The cream began to take on the consistency of foam after about 2 minutes, and at the end of 5 minutes the foam was beginning to dissipate and leave big empty patches on my skin, so I rinsed it off.  

My skin didn't look any different when done.  It didn't feel any different when done.  For $52 I expected at least some type of visible change - even if it made my skin redder, or plumper, or something.

One night i styed up late and that Murad infomercial came on and it looked pretty convincing since there where no celebritys advertising it and they even compared it to proactiv, so i tough i would give it a try so i ordered it online the next day.

Couple Of Days later i received the package and i was pretty exited so i began to use it and liked the overall feel of it. few days pass by and i wake up one morning with all these little white heads in my upper chin and i was immidiately grossed out but since they said it was normal due to purging i didnt worry much, one week later it got worse and even began breaking out in places i hadnt before like in my forehead. I knew somethign wasnt right so i went online and started reading other custumer reviews and was shocked at the similaruty of thwe problem so i freaked out and decided to stop using it because it got so bad to the point where i didnt wanna be seen and on top of that it became very painful both physically and mentally i becamed sorth of depressed about the situation i sorth of felt like a teen going trough puberty again.

I paid to have the Murad Acne Complex expedited to me because I was so anxious to get on to 'beautiful, clear skin.'

It'd be appropriate for preteens, but not grown women, then again, should I be surprised? I suppose the scent caters well to Spears' followers, 12 year olds"

Then few seconds later it mellows out a bit and smells somewhat herbal. After 15 minutes you won't be able to smell it at all. Very hyped up mediocre perfume with very steep price tag. You'd be better off buying a bottle of Herbal Essence shower gel and getting identical results"

This product worked very well as far as thoroughly cleaning her face, hands etc. It did not irritate her skin at all...the problem, the one and only problem, is the fragrance, if you can call it that. It stinks so bad, I did not want to go near her after I wiped her down...I had to give her a bath, it was so bad"

""songstress, piano technician, and espresso junkie extraordinairre""",lust comes into phaze,"i got this bar based on the other reviews, and boy, is it strong! the bar will last a very good long while, unless you can actually stomach the smell of gallons of patchouli without getting a major headache. patchouli was originally supposed to be a base scent for other sweeter scents to sit upon. it was never supposed to be a stand-alone perfume! 
like all the LUSH bubble bars, this definitely packs the bubbles in a small amount. i just have buyers remorse because i now have this oversized bar (and it is a very big bar), and i can only use bits of it when my fiance is out of town because he gets an allergic reaction to the strong strong STRONG smell. 
i think the upside is that it seems like the scent isn't nearly so strong once you're actually *in* the bath. or maybe by then your olfactory senses are so overwhelmed you just can't tell the difference anymore.
so yeah, if you love love LOOOOOOOOVE patchouli, then this is truly the bath bar for you. otherwise, i'd steer clear and go for something gentler. the hot milk bubble bar is the opposite of this bar, in that it's really gentle on the nose. and any of the jasmine flavored products would also be a better recommendation than this one.
i love LUSH, but not this bar"

I had mild acne, I've used a lot of Benzoyl Peroxide products etc persagel, Clearasil, etc.  One day I saw a commerical for this Murad product, which looked too good to be true.  I've ordered the product because the price was cheaper than some of the other products and it had ""real people"" saying the product worked.  I did follow the instructions on the 3 products.  Less than a week, my face broke out even more, I had some cystic acne which I never had before.  It was astonishing, but the company said there was a ""purging"" state, which I held out hope that it would be a minor setback.  2 weeks later, again I started breaking out on both sides of my face and under my neck and chin area.  I am so dumbfounded that this product said it would make a difference within a month.  It's been 1 month and 3 weeks and I am so disappointed.  I've stop using this product for the last 3 days and my skin is getting better and I've cancelled any future products from this company.  DON'T RECOMMEND IT"

Never having acne before, this was devistating.  I watched all the infomercials and decided to go with Murad's Acne Complex Kit expecting the glowing, perfect skin that they promised within a few short weeks.  I purchased the starter kit and I liked the smell of the products but after a month and a half, I was still experiencing bad breakouts.  I even had the really painful acne that are so deep it takes weeks for them to come to the surface!  I continued to use the second shipment of Murad because everything I read said that the purging cycle could take 4 or more weeks.  I spent 3 months and over $60 on this stuff without results.  Silly me, I was going to order more but I started reading reviews for my only alternative, Proactiv.  Now that stuff isn't any cheaper in the long run but someone else mentioned Acne Free in their review and I figured that it was worth a try.  I found it at my local Walreens for $19.  Let me tell you, I used Acne Free for 2, TWO, days and saw results that I had not seen in 3 months of using the expensive stuff.  I can't say enough about it.  I'm thrilled that something so easy to get would work so much better than any hyped up product.  Goes to show, don't buy from T.V. "
