My Baby's face just lights up when he's placed in his bed for naps or night time. However we find ourself running back in forth so much because the cute little songs have stopped before he falls asleep.  I was looking online and saw that some of these new mobiles have remotes on them. It would seem that with the all the new things that come out the manufactors would have given the public the option to have a wind up mobile or a remote mobile.  I hope that someone from these places reads these and takes the time to put more thought into what parents would want in future purchases. 

But like as I said before we love the look and love they way my son reacts to it.  So I'll look at this mobile being a weight loss bonus for all the running back and forth"

Although, if you read the instructions for ANY mobile, when the child is old enough to sit or stand in the crib (around 6 months), you are supposed to take it off.  They are not built for anyone to play with them.  My son liked his mobile so much that when he was old enough to reach it, we took it off and my husband attached it to the top of his hutch.  This way we were still able to play the song, but he couldn't reach it.  

I think this mobile is a perfect way to add to the room's theme.  For those who looking to buy this mobile, or any other mobile:  Go to the store where you are buying your crib, and try it out.  The people at Babies R Us must have thought I was nuts, because I took the quilt and the mobile from the set I wanted and took them to the crib I was buying.  I was able to determine if the mobile would fit before I bought it, and I got to see how the colors in the bedding looked with the color of the crib.  This eliminated a lot of hassle for me later on with taking the mobile back if it didn't fit"

He immediately loved the musical buttons and the sun, and ignored everything else. As he grew, he discovered the other toys one by one. It was exciting to watch him perfecting the different skills necessary to manipulate the activities.

Because I used the Baby Einstein as a secure place for meals, it needed regular cleaning. The seat pops right off for easy cleaning, but the cloth saddle is a little hard to unsnap from the base. Overall, the assembly is pretty easy - I put it together myself and I am NOT mechanically inclined.

I definitely recommend the Baby Einstein activity center. I looked at several other brands and was turned off by all the obnoxious toys and activities. I wanted something Toby could learn from, not just be dazzled by the bells and whistles. I can't say Toby learned any Spanish from the language buttons, but the Baby Einstein kept my son engaged even at 11 months, when his willingness to stay in one place was usually short-lived."

I can honestly say this this Activity Center is worth the extra 15-20 dollars you might have to spend. To begin,the seat swivels easily for the baby to move from one activity to the next. That might not be an important issue for older babies but my daughter was 4 months old when she started to use this and compared to the other exersaucer,it really makes a differnce having a seat she can maneuver. The toys attachments are of great quality and offer a variety of skills for baby to learn from and to be entertained by. I can't say enough positive things about this Activity Center.

(It was a poop-eroo for us too.)

A few things that I learned using this though is:
The blue spinning toy doesn't come out and yucky stuff can collect underneath it.  It is incredibly hard to clean.
The one that I got was a pain in the tush to get the batteries in, so once the batteries died, we set the kangaroo part aside.
My daughter's feet got rubbed raw when we first got this because she loved jumping in it.  I recommend using a pair of Robeez, or at very least a pair of socks, to protect their feet"

Initially, he would just sit in the seat, occassionally moving sideways (probably because he lost his balance). After 5-10 minutes he was ready to hit the eject button (he'd had enough).  That lasted 4 or 5 days during which we'd put him in the Jumperoo 2 or 3 times per day with hopes that he'd grow to enjoy it.  

On the 5th day he began jumping up-and-down like a crazed kangaroo!  His face had a wide smile and some drool, he was excited!  From that point forward (and still going) he's consistently loved his time in the J-roo.  He regularly has jumping sessions of 30-45 minutes while watching Clifford, Dragon Tales, ...

This is a great way for little T to be in a upright position while strengthening his little legs.  Also, it's not a bad break for us parents now and again"

But we did have a good run for this and it was worth it. He would bounce back and forth and say ""AHHHHHHH!"" and just laugh really hard.

It is great to have way more of these necessities to start off with, that's months of not having to remember to buy any!

I love the bucket-thing this comes in - one currently holds all our bath stuff for easy toting to the bathroom.  The other one is our bib-holder, since we have a TON of bibs. It keeps them neat, all in one place and closes and can be put away for guests.  

The vapor bath is fantastic.  We just got over my son's first cold and it worked like a charm. He loves baths to begin with and this filled the whole bathroom with that soothing vapor and within minutes I could hear the difference in his breathing! When I caught the cold a few days later, I have to admit, I also took a vapor bath and it was better than a hot shower for clearing my congestion!

I don't know that the Lavendar one necessarily calms or soothes the baby, but it smells nice.  We've gotten shampoo in his eye at least once with no tears or fuss, so it must not burn. 

I definitely recommend getting this for new moms-to-be"

It's also easier to buckle the baby up without so much extra clothing bunching up everywhere- and probably safer too!! When we get to where ever we are going I just unzip the sides and he's fine.

With the Bundle Me I didn't have to struggle putting my baby in any coats or buntings then struggle with the bulkiness to get him into the carrier in order to take him out into the cold. An additional bonus I found was that if I needed to take him indoors but keep him in the carrier I didn't need to worry about him overheating. I just had to unzip the top blanket and pull it back. It's like a little sleeping bag. Unfortunately, I think my son will be too big for his current carrier when winter befalls us again. I think we will be moving on to a carseat instead of a carrier at that point so the Bundle Me will be less useful.

Perhaps you are (as I am) soon to be expecting and realize that you won't have a lot of time to read up about what your baby may/may not be up to and if it is normal after your baby arrives.  Well then this book is for you!
   I eagerly started the book on Friday and finished it (yes all 500 pages) on Saturday.  What a delight.  The author uses plenty of references from real life Moms and Dads which add wonderful insite and humor.  Be warned though, if you are looking for the ""What to expect book"" format this is not for you.  This is a realistic, warm, and funny look at life that tackles hard to discuss topics in a safe and humorous way.
   If you are tired of the same old at this age your child will _____ books then definately pick this up.  Its like talking to an old friend that you haven't met yet who has been there and knows the struggles and confusion that comes with having a baby"

From the very beginning, she has been an incredibly alert and interested baby.  She was born c-section at 38 weeks with eyes and hands wide open.  Once they were finished cleaning her up, my husband and I were thrilled to just cuddle her and talk to her while she looked at us both with wide eyes and made little coo coo sounds.  Right away she was great at nursing with a very good latch.  She rarely ever cried, and when she did, it was a quiet little ""lay lay lay"" sound, not the wild Waa-waa's.  

Throughout infancy she was always capable of adapting to every situation quickly and without emotional outburst.  Where it would seem other children would be over-stimulated in an environment, she would thrive and seem to want more stimulation!  At only three months of age, people thought she was older because of her alertness and interest in people and animals.  She hit every developmental milestone months early, especially in language (sign and speech), music appreciation, and colors/shape/letter/number recognition.  Her pediatrician has been happily surprised by her and suggested that I should have five more just like her! 

When we bought the BabyPlus, we thought, ""if it helps only 10% as well as the testimonials say it does, it will be worth it"".  We're certain it has contributed positively in helping develop this little miracle of ours.  We're now expecting child #2 (25 weeks along) and although not using the Baby Plus could be an interesting experiment (same gene pool, same parenting, etc.), we're too interested in the possibilities of how much it may contribute to our next child for us to withhold it.

Altman ""gocheapbooks""",suburbs of new york city,"ok so how many people think their baby is exceptional? Well, pretty much everyone i know, and they are all right of course.  Each baby is exceptional, in their own way.  But how many babies are rated as exceptional by pediatricians, nurses and early childhood educators?  Well, I know one - MINE!  I faithfully used the babyplus system when I was pregnant.  One time when using it, he started knocking back. Yeap, i actually felt him knock back at it, in rhythm.  It only happened once, but I told my husband that i think this is going to be one special kid.  I was about 7 months pregnant then.  Well, lo and behold, after he was born people (professionals) don't stop telling us how amazing he is.  He is the most aware newborn you will ever meet.  He is 2 months old now, and has been sleeping through the night (11 hours at a time) since he was 2 weeks.  He cries when he needs something, and never cries for no reason (but i do make sure to respond quickly to his needs so i don't know how much that has to do with it.).  Yesterday he started reaching for objects.  Can't quite grab them yet, but it doesn't stop him from trying. The pediatrician and the nurse remarked how incredibly physically strong he is, how aware he seems and the fact that he vocalizes to music is unheard of at this age.  He's been holding his head up since the day he was born (3 days late) and has been making eye contact since about 2 weeks.  So, i don't really know what if anything the baby plus system had to do with it.  I mean it could be just an accident but... all I can say is that I will definitely use this product with our future children.  I would pay thousands if i had to (and we are not rich people) because its worth every penny"

However, when I went back to the testimonials to compare I realized that my son has accomplished many of the same feats other Baby Plus babies have.  I cannot believe that only 13 weeks of using this system had such a positive impact on my son's development.  He never had colic, has been extremely happy and expressive since he was born, laughs as if it's rolling from his toes since he was 4 months, latched on immediately after birth and today has a vocabulary of about 50 words, not including animal sounds he can make or hand gestures he's memorized for his favorites songs.

Pollock,"Redmond, WA  USA","We bought this swing just under a year ago, when our baby was about two months old.  She LOVED this swing and was either asleep in it, or just peacefully playing and looking around the room at us.  Now she is 14 months and has not used it for awhile, so two months ago friends bought it from us for their newborn son.

They used it only two months, when one day they turned it off and smoke started coming out of the motor compartment.  The batteries were intact, but the swing didn't work whatsoever anymore, even with new batteries.

I called Fisher Price, and they were very concerned about the smoke.  I didn't have the purchase receipt anymore, and wasn't sure if it was still covered by the warranty.  They asked for the Product Code and Run Code, and where I bought it (Babies R Us).  They are now sending me a brand new motor housing (the entire top portion of the swing, which you just attach the legs to).  They are also sending a pre-paid label to put on the box, so I can send them the dead motor housing.  How great is that!

I am so impressed and amazed by Fisher Price's customer service.  No receipt, and still they are totally helping me out and basically replacing the swing.  Talk about gaining customer loyalty!  It's good to know you can pay $130 for a baby item and get your money's worth all around.

The swing itself is just wonderful.  The motor is quiet, my baby loved the moving bugs, and the two swinging directions offers a nice change for the baby.  The swing's colors are great as well, soothing and neutral, instead of the usual super bright primary colors on most other swings"

It seems that all you have to do is look at them and they lock.  Since we are constantly moving the chair to us, or back to the wall, etc., this is a real problem because you have to unlock them (esp. if more than one of the four is locked) in order to move the chair easily.  As baby gets heavier and heavier and becomes a toddler, this is even harder.  The pleats at the bottom of the seat pad are probably unnecessary and definately hard to get the crumbs out of.  If it weren't for the brakes, I would give it 5 stars.

Each has different textures, images, and something unique about it.
-The yellow block has a duck on the one side that ""quacks"" when pressed.  On the other side is a sun whose face flips up to reveal a tiny mirror.  Another side has a picture of some bananas with a clear plastic over them to make for an interesting texture and yet another side contains a circle motif.
-The red block rattles, has a picture of a robin (?) on the one side, a square pattern motif on another side, and a picture of strawberries on another.
-The green block has a frog with 3D legs and the one leg is a pull toy that will cause the block to shake.  It also has a picture of a green apple (mine does, at least, although this picture shows a leaf), a silky fabric with leaf prints, and a triangle motif.
-The blue block is another rattle.  It has a picture of the BE turtle on one side, some jeans made from real denim on another, and a star motif on another.
-All blocks have a side with the color's name (I bought mine at Target, and they have the name in english, spanish, and french although these pictured only show it in English).  The rest of the sides are filled with textured fabrics such as a soft, fluffly fur or a bumpy texture (like the material found on the bottom of some slippers to prevent skidding).
My three month old loves to look at these blocks and I rub the different sides against her skin while saying ""soft"", ""smooth"", or ""bumpy"" and she loves the feelings.  My friend's daughter, who is five months, loves to pick up and throw down the blocks.  It's one of her favorite games.  I'd reccomend these blocks as a must have for any infant"

He immediately loved the musical buttons and the sun, and ignored everything else. As he grew, he discovered the other toys one by one. It was exciting to watch him perfecting the different skills necessary to manipulate the activities.

Because I used the Baby Einstein as a secure place for meals, it needed regular cleaning. The seat pops right off for easy cleaning, but the cloth saddle is a little hard to unsnap from the base. Overall, the assembly is pretty easy - I put it together myself and I am NOT mechanically inclined.

I definitely recommend the Baby Einstein activity center. I looked at several other brands and was turned off by all the obnoxious toys and activities. I wanted something Toby could learn from, not just be dazzled by the bells and whistles. I can't say Toby learned any Spanish from the language buttons, but the Baby Einstein kept my son engaged even at 11 months, when his willingness to stay in one place was usually short-lived."

Plus, it's a nice safe place for times when I'd like to get something done without having to keep a constant eye on one of the babies.

Although, if you read the instructions for ANY mobile, when the child is old enough to sit or stand in the crib (around 6 months), you are supposed to take it off.  They are not built for anyone to play with them.  My son liked his mobile so much that when he was old enough to reach it, we took it off and my husband attached it to the top of his hutch.  This way we were still able to play the song, but he couldn't reach it.  

I think this mobile is a perfect way to add to the room's theme.  For those who looking to buy this mobile, or any other mobile:  Go to the store where you are buying your crib, and try it out.  The people at Babies R Us must have thought I was nuts, because I took the quilt and the mobile from the set I wanted and took them to the crib I was buying.  I was able to determine if the mobile would fit before I bought it, and I got to see how the colors in the bedding looked with the color of the crib.

It's like a little sleeping bag. Unfortunately, I think my son will be too big for his current carrier when winter befalls us again.

Perhaps you are (as I am) soon to be expecting and realize that you won't have a lot of time to read up about what your baby may/may not be up to and if it is normal after your baby arrives.

This is a realistic, warm, and funny look at life that tackles hard to discuss topics in a safe and humorous way.

Pollock,"Redmond, WA  USA","We bought this swing just under a year ago, when our baby was about two months old.  She LOVED this swing and was either asleep in it, or just peacefully playing and looking around the room at us.  Now she is 14 months and has not used it for awhile, so two months ago friends bought it from us for their newborn son.

They used it only two months, when one day they turned it off and smoke started coming out of the motor compartment.  The batteries were intact, but the swing didn't work whatsoever anymore, even with new batteries.

I called Fisher Price, and they were very concerned about the smoke.  I didn't have the purchase receipt anymore, and wasn't sure if it was still covered by the warranty.  They asked for the Product Code and Run Code, and where I bought it (Babies R Us).  They are now sending me a brand new motor housing (the entire top portion of the swing, which you just attach the legs to).  They are also sending a pre-paid label to put on the box, so I can send them the dead motor housing.  How great is that!

I am so impressed and amazed by Fisher Price's customer service.  No receipt, and still they are totally helping me out and basically replacing the swing.  Talk about gaining customer loyalty!  It's good to know you can pay $130 for a baby item and get your money's worth all around.

The swing itself is just wonderful.  The motor is quiet, my baby loved the moving bugs, and the two swinging directions offers a nice change for the baby.  The swing's colors are great as well, soothing and neutral, instead of the usual super bright primary colors on most other swings"

I only quit using the net when my daughter started to roll. Now se sits up and has plenty of room to splash. I also like the elevated seat so that way she is not slipping and sliding all over the tub. My daughter also loves the toys that come with it

It has been the best yet for us.  From infant stage to now 6 months old, my daughter has fit snugly.  As an infant, the sling is perfect because you can't immerse the baby while the stump is still attached.  We used the tub on the counter by the bathroom sink, which worked very well while she was in the hammock stage.  Once her stump fell off, and she was able to control her head well, we lowered the bottom half of the hammock into the tub and let baby's bottom rest in the nook that is created between the hump and the top part of the tub.  A perfect angle for baby to rest comfortably while getting a bath.  This is the position in which we currently use our tub.  Now, however, we bathe her in the Aquarium tub instide the bathtub so we don't have to worry about where the water lands.  Finally, once baby is old enough to sit without support, we'll remove the sling altogether and let her sit in the wide end of the tub to play during bath time.  No doubt our daughter will enjoy this final transition in the short weeks ahead"

Smith,"Sacramento, CA United States","This is a nice chair, except for the brakes.  They lock so easily that if you just barely brush by them with your foot, they lock.  It seems that all you have to do is look at them and they lock.  Since we are constantly moving the chair to us, or back to the wall, etc., this is a real problem because you have to unlock them (esp. if more than one of the four is locked) in order to move the chair easily.  As baby gets heavier and heavier and becomes a toddler, this is even harder.  The pleats at the bottom of the seat pad are probably unnecessary and definately hard to get the crumbs out of.  If it weren't for the brakes, I would give it 5 stars. The toy aquarium is nice except that they could make the large push pads which make the fish move around in the water, easier for little ones to push"

The second time we tried to open it one of the spines broke and now the tent is useless.  For $100 it shouldn't have broken that easily.  When we had it up the first and only time, however, it was great.  Our nine month old son loved it.  I sat in the center of the tent while he crawled laps around me, chasing some little plastic balls.  He liked hearing the crinkling of the tent fabric as he moved across it.  The tent does need to be pegged in any kind of wind, but this is easy to do.  Another reviewer said the tent was hot, but we're in Hawaii where there's always at least a breeze and it was fine.  There is also a slit in the one wall of the tent which allows the wind to pass through.  I'm going to try and contact the manufacturer about the lack of instructions and the relative fragility of the tent's parts.  If I am satisfied with their response I will order the tent again.  It really was great once it was set up.  However, I will be more careful when opening it and will try and find a non-windy place to do it. "

The only downside is that the swing motor does make noise, but the sound is relatively minimal and can be easily tuned out.

Also, the handles are tall enough that he is not hunched over pushing the stroller. There are a lot of other great features, too. There is a carry strap that is great for transporting the stroller.

I do recommend getting the accessory pack, which also has a rain cover and carry-bag for the stroller.

We have a more expensive, larger, ""safer"" stroller with more features, but we have found we never use it and always use this one.

Collapsing the stroller to pop into the car is a breeze, and there is an adequate shoulder strap for you to carry the stroller when you are doing portage over rough ground.

We take the stroller everywhere. We've used it on well-groomed trails for hiking, museums, restaurants, we've even used it at the beach, and we've used it on the Paris Metro. This is a great stroller for train and subway travel.

The wheels have a lock feature which allows them to rotate, or swivel, and the rear wheels have a brake mechanism which is a little awkward to release, but I find that comforting rather than frustrating: I want solid brakes.

There is a small basket in the back of the stroller for a baby bag, purse, and a few groceries, so this again is an excellent stroller for when you are just running out for a few things or going on a small picnic. If I was an apartment dweller in the city, this is the stroller I'd get.

The only bad feature: this is not a stroller you can run with! Don't even try.

The harness is excellent, but takes time to adjust it correctly so that it is not too snug nor too loose. This is a super lightweight stroller, but is a quality product with excellent engineering and design. It is not like those flimsy twenty-dollar throwaways and just has the MacLaren name on it: this is the real deal. We have used it for two kids, still works like new.

Shortly after she turned 4 she started waking up with dry pull ups.  We gave it a few weeks to make sure it wasn't a fluke & then invested in *two* of these pads.  The tuck in feature on both sides is great & I find that it does stay in place even after a nights sleep.  She finds it comfortable as she's never complained about it (of course, Princess sheets accomanied this new pad to encourage acceptance and we made a HUGE deal about her giving up Pull Ups & sleeping in regular underwear).  The best part about this design is that if there is an accident, you just whip it off (and any other top sheet that might have gotten wet) and tuck in a dry one.  No changing the fitted sheet in the middle of the night.  For us, if the top sheet or blanket gets wet, I've got a second comforter/blanket in her closet to quickly throw over her. (of course pajama changing can't be avoided) That helps get everyone back to sleep as fast as possible.  I've washed them a number of times & they come out of the dryer in the same shape every time (follow washing instructions). The size is also generous.  I was worried that she might move off the pad during the night, but with proper placement to where she normally sleeps most of the night, we've never had a problem.  It says it absorbs 6 cups; while we haven't tested that, I've never found the pad dripping, so all the urine was securely soaked in.  We haven't found a down side to these pads.  Even the price isn't bad-- I did some price comparison and maybe you'll find them a few bucks less, but not by much.  And, if I may add in a bit of my own potty training 2-cents, my husband wanted her to give up pull ups much earlier, but I was in no mood to change sheets (or these pads) *every* night.  I've read that most toddlers' bladders aren't large enough to make it thru the night anyway, so I was just as happy to let it happen naturally. In that way, everyone was happy (well I was and you know what they say about Mamma being happy-- everyone's happy!)  Thus, I highly recommend this pad to anyone going down the no-more-Pull-Ups Road.  I am sure it would be just as useful for any older child (and parents) dealing with bed-wetting problem. "

We have used it with all the grandchildren (6) and one nephew. 
  
 I think it needs some design improvements: 
  
 (1) the straps which are used to hold it to a chair would be better if there were a strap which went from front to back, not just around the back of the seat. One of the grandkids seems unable to sit still and I keep expecting him to tip over the chair because it tends to slide sideways in the front. 
  
 (2) the tray is designed for a slim child. On one side, the tray fits a finger like protusion into a hole. On the other side, there are 2 places to attach the tray in slots. Only when the tray is in the innermost position, is it aligned directly in front of the child and there isn't a great deal of tummy room. If you move the tray to the outer position (available on one side only), the tray is cocked at an angle and it still probably wouldn't accomodate a child with a larger stomach. 
  
 (3) the belts to hold the child need to be longer. 
  
 Fortunately for us, all the grandkids and nephew are slim. At least so far"

I use this gate for my dogs, but it would be equally effective for a baby. It is sturdy, easy to operate, good-looking, and as unobtrusive as a gate can be.

This gate is not pressure-mounted. It needs to be screwed into the wall on both sides.  However, I have learned the hard way that the pressure-mounted gates do a lot of damage to walls, they are more difficult to operate, and they are bulky. If the need for a gate is going to be relatively long-term, I now believe that it is easier to screw it in and worry about patching the wall when the time comes.

I've also learned that gates with vertical bars are more likely to be left alone because it's more difficult for pups to get a purchase on them. The ones with grids or cross-pieces encourage dogs to rattle them -- and to jump, a habit that I work hard to extinguish"

I strongly recommend following the advice of one of the other reviewers to skip using the template.  The lower fixture on the hinge side is lowest to the ground, so I installed that first, then held it in place to mark the spot for the upper hinge.  After that was on, I put the gate on the hinges, held it in place and marked the opposite side. Worked great, and it allowed me to work around the mouldings, which would have been difficult with the template.

The wood screws held great in the one bannister on one staircase.  On the other staircase, I had to put the gates into drywall.  There was a beam on one side, so I had to buy much longer screws to ensure a tight grip.  The other side was hollow, so I bought some good metal anchors, so the gate is on very tight.  All I did was bring the fixtures to the hardware store and found screws and anchors that would fit the holes.  Cost me about $10 to get enough anchors and screws for four gates.

Most of the poor reviews sound like there are some hardware issues.  I take one star away because I think the gate should come with alternate screws, and maybe anchors, because I think it's a bad assumption that most people are installing into wood.  I would very much recommend this gate, but advise paying close attention to what you're installing into first and make sure you've got the right hardware"

This bra in particular is EXTREMELY comfortable on sore nipples.  I have sensitive skin and nipples and I found this to be the best there is (Bravado was too rough for me as were some other night nursing bras I tried).  The material is sort of a pantyhose type of material where when you slip it on, it feels as though there's nothing there but it protects and supports your sensitive breasts (especially important during the first several weeks of first time nursing).  It's not really a bra that you'd want to wear on an evening out as it's more of a sports type bra and it would not support adequately for high impact activities (like aerobics, etc...) but it's perfect for around the house or errand running or low impact activities such as yoga.

For the most part works well, except if you are running in rather windy conditions, then, it just flies back and does not cover the kids so well.  I really use my double jog stroller for jogging and am happy to have the sunshade, the kids like it too.  The only other frustration is if you have a small child who is rather reclined in the stroller and the sun is close to setting, you may not get good coverage to keep the sun out of eyes unless you pull the shade completely over the stroller . . . then the older child isn't too happy because he/she can''t see out!

Soon enough they outgrew the seating layout and the mirror got stowed in the door pocket.  It was great for the kids and us and we really got a lot of use out of it.  But wait, we weren't done with it yet!

When I got my Jeep, I happened to come across the little mirror again and decided to try it for a blind spot mirror.  I never liked those little circular ones that go on the side mirrors because they take up too much room and they're so small they aren't really very useful.  

Instead I stuck this mirror up on the left corner of my windshield where the only thing it blocked is low flying aircraft.  And it provides a rear-view that covers my blind spot perfectly and is large enough to actually see what's going on.  The added bonus is that because it's inside, it never gets wet, icy or fogged up.  It's been on my windshield ever since.

The kids are 7 and 9 now so that little mirror is almost a decade old and it still sticks to the window and has survived several bumps and never broke!  Not bad for a few bucks"

Hatch ""EVERYTHING'S EVENTUAL""","PORT RICHEY, FL","I DECIDED TO POTTY TRAIN MY SON USING JUST A POTTY TOPPER AND A STOOL. HE REALLY LOVES TO DO THINGS ALL BY HIMSELF JUST LIKE MOMMY AND DADDY SO I FIGURED THAT WOULD WORK BEST FOR HIM. NO MATTER WHAT I DID HE CONTINUED TO HAVE ACCIDENT AFTER ACCIDENT. WE WOULD SIT IN THE BATHROOM FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND HE WOULD ALWAYS PEE AFTER I TOOK HIM OFF THE POTTY. I DECIDED THAT GETTING HIM HIS OWN POTTY SEAT WOULD ENABLE HIM TO SIT ON THE POTTY FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME, INFRONT OF THE TV OR IN THE LIVING ROOM, WITH THE FAMILY, OR IN HIS ROOM. I THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE JUST THE THING TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND SO I WENT ON THE INTERNET TO PICK ONE OUT. I PICKED THE BABYBJORN POTTY CHAIR BECAUSE OF THE SIMPLICITY OF THE DESIGN, EASY CLEAN UP AND THE DEFLECTOR. MOST SEATS HAVE VERY SMALL DEFLECTORS OR NONE AT ALL. SOME HAVE DEFLECTORS THAT DON'T STAY PUT. I ALSO LIKED THAT IS WAS DESIGNED TO STAY ON THE FLOOR AND NOT SLIP, SLIDE, OR GET STUCK TO THE CHILD.

THE DAY THIS ARRIVED MY SON HAD HAD THREE CONSECUTIVE ACCIDENTS TO SPITE THAT FACT THAT WE HAD SPEND MOST OF THE DAY IN THE BATHROOM. I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GIVE UP AND PUT HIM BACK IN PULL UPS WHEN IT FINALLY ARRIVED. HE WAS SCARED AT FIRST BUT I TOLD HIM THAT THIS WAS HIS VERY OWN NEW POTTY CHAIR AND THE SECOND HE SAT DOWN HE PEED IN IT!!! I LET HIM TAKE THE POT TO THE BIG POTTY AND DUMP IT WITH ME AND THAT WAS IT! HE WAS HOOKED. I DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO ENCOURAGE HIM ANYMORE OR HARASS HIM TO SIT DOWN. HE WOULD JUST RUN RIGHT OVER AND PEE AND THEN DECLARE ""I DID IT!!!! MOMMY HELP ME DUMP IT."" HE ONLY USED THIS POTTY CHAIR FOR ONLY ONE DAY BUT IT WAS DEFINETLY WHAT HE NEEDED TO GET THE IDEA. THE VERY NEXT MORNING HE SAID THAT HE WANTED TO USE THE BIG POTTY NOW AND HAS NEVER LOOKED BACK. WE USE THE POTTY CHAIR NOW FOR OUTINGS. IT IS GREAT! EASY TO CLEAN AND EASY TO BRING ALONG IN THE CAR!!! I WOULD HAVE GIVEN 5 STARS IF NOT FOR THE FACT THAT THE DEFLECTOR IS JUST A BIT LOW. IF MY SON WASN'T LEANING FORWARD TO WATCH HIMSELF PEE IT WOULD BE A CLOSE CALL.

THERE WERE A FEW REVIEWS THAT STATED THAT THEIR CHILD'S LEGS WERE BEING SQUISHED BECAUSE OF THE DEFLECTOR BEING SO WIDE...MY SON WILL BE 3 IN 2 MONTHS AND HE IS A BIG BOY IN THE TOP 75 PERCENT FOR HEIGHT AND WEIGHT AND HE FIT FINE WITH LOTS OF ROOM TO SPARE!!!

He even brought it out of the bathroom and took it into the living room to watch The Wiggles while sitting in it. I like the color, and how it fits his size. He can sit on it and get up all by himself. Its very sturdy, it doesn't wobble or tip over like some do. One reviewer said the sprout was a little short, but I haven't had a problem. My son tends to look down at himself while he's going, so everything is pointing south anyway. I love that there are only 2 pieces to this chair. Very easy to clean. I had a safety 1st chair with the flip top lid and the detachable sprout and I absolutely hated this thing. My son would pull of the sprout and walk around the house with it. He was too concerned with the lid and turning around on the chair to pull the lid up and down instead of concentrating on trying to go potty.

We live in a townhouse and his room is a 14' x 30' space in our walkout basement. One portion of this area is used for our storage and exercise equipment, however, so we were very nervous that he would pull something down on himself. I realize that the manufacturers do not advertise this use, but it is possible to link these gates end to end in order to cover a longer stretch. The gate cleans up easily and was much less expensive (even with needing to purchase two) than the other configuration gate options. Our son is 19 mos old and 38"" tall (very tall) and he has not gone over the gate- he leaves it alone! He is able to climb over many of the plastic and metal pressure gates. It did take a bit of installation time (about an hour for both gates), and you will need basic skills to install it. One other thing, my husband had to go out and buy a drill bit that was the right size for the gate install- 7/32"", so be prepared. This was the best $200 I've spent on toddler products thus far"

I had it installed within 1 hour.  As is usual with these kind of things, if you are installing into sheetrock, be forewarned that the anchors that come with the gate hardware are pooky and you will need to buy some decent ones at the hardware store.  That's really my only complaint, but it's seems to always be the case with any factory-provided hardware these days.  We are very pleased with it and it was worth the money."

My house is rather small but there is a large open area between the kitchen,living room,hallway, and door to basement; this is the highest traffic area in the house. Also, none of the walls or corners are straight across from each other making it impossible to use a more ""traditional"" gate. I actually found it easier not to attach this gate to the wall so I can change what part of the house I want my daughter to have access to. It is possible for the gate to tip over if my 2-year-old daughter is playing with it, so I made a rule that she is not allowed to ""play"" with the gate.

We called customer service at Summer and they had a new gate and free return shipping label to us in three days! Installation was fairly easy for my husband who is not particularly handy with tools. We like the fabric/mesh since our daughter can't climb it like other gates. The only thing I don't like quite so much is that the latching mechanism is not terribly easy to use. You have to line up the gate and then pull slightly on the handle to seat the latch properly. Takes a little while to get used to.

If you don't need all that length you can detach a panel or use it in a v-shape to angle it while using all three panels.
I found it so easy to install just using two brackets on each wall. The screws and anchors provided were all I needed to install into drywall. Plus they give you a template to make it even easier to line up the screws.

DON'T BE TURNED OFF BECAUSE OF PREVIOUS REVIEWER!!,"February 12, 2007",mamazo,"Jersey City, NJ USA","What the previous reviewer didn't realize is that there are 2 different packaging options for this item. The first option is a pack that contains 1 key and 2 locks for people who want to try it out and the second option is to buy the pack that contains 4 locks but no key for those who already bought the starter kit and happened to like the product. So make sure you really read the description of what you're getting if you're buying online. (This one happens do be the 4 locks with no key so you might want to try the starter kit first...I actually rec. it because UNFORTUNATELY the lock doesn't work with all situations because of draw designs) Then on top of that Kidco also sells the key seperately with no locks for those who have the product, love it, and happened to misplace or lose their key OR want to purchase an additional incase they ever lose the 1st key. I will admit that I think it's pretty lame for a company to try to squeeze every penny out of you especially when it probaby only costs 5 cents to make the darn key and especially when you're dealing with child safety products. As far as how well the product works...I LOVE IT and wish it had worked out better with all my draw situations! It's especially great for those cabinet doors that stand alone and don't have another door next to it where you can just buy one of those wrap around door knob locks that require 2 knobs to be side by side. I didn't have as great of luck with my kitchen draws because the draw panel is added on to the actual draw so it isn't flush with where you put the catch. I put 5 stars to bring the rating up because the last reviewer only gave one and it's actually a great product. I know it will outsmart my baby far beyond any cheaper options out there. I installed them with the adhesive tape that comes with it but I plan on reattaching it with the screws also included because I personally feel that the screws will do a better job AND because I love my child more than my freaking cabinet doors for all those worried about messing up your precious wood cabinets...I mean give me a break...the holes are so small anyway and it's totally concealed, only you will know it's there. ALSO, this locks so tight that little fingers/hands can't reach inside small openings (which usually occures with the other types of locks) and pull stuff out. And also there's an option to turn the lock off for in between kids. DEFINITELY CONSIDER THIS PRODUCT!!!!"

We've had a terrible time getting him to sit forward and stay seated in a shopping cart.  Which makes grocery shopping precarious.  He is very quick to stand up and turn around in the cart if we take our eyes off him.  I looked and looked for a five-point harness that I could use with a shopping cart and then stumbled across the Shop n' Dine at TJMaxx.  IT WORKS WONDERS.  He was so secure and comfortable.  We never once had to sit him back down, turn him around, or anything.  I also had a place for my own drink that was out of his reach (the cup holder on front held my fast-food super-size drink).  My son never complained about the seat and I wish I had found this months earlier (he is 14 months now).  It's perfect.  One thing I found was that I was able to use the shopping cart strap in addition to the 5-point harness on this product which in effect made a 7-point harness (over the shoulders and between the legs with the product and around the chest with the shopping cart strap).  Another thing - My son usually pulls shoulder straps off, but these stayed in place and he never messed with them. And even though he was straped in securely, he was comfortable and able to play with us, point to things, play with toys, etc.  He wasn't at all paralyzed or completely immobilized by the straps.

Its also great that you can fit standard sized bottles onto the pump itself. Basically, there are no complaints here"

I have the hospital grade Medela pump, which is fantastic--I get plenty of milk without nursing, and am even able to pump extra to store.

I bought this pump because I've run into trouble a couple times when I was away from the house for longer than expected.  My regular pump has to be plugged in (it does not run on batteries) so it's hard to carry around.  I bought this pump because it is easy to throw into the diaper bag in case of 1) engorgement or 2) needing a bottle while I'm out.

Although I'm not a fan of handpumping and have not used other manual pumps, I've found this one easy to use.  Basically it works just like like the hospital grade--and I get just as much milk, just as quickly, with this pump!  The design is so comfortable that I have even pumped while driving home one day when I got stuck in major rush-hour traffic.  Being able to use it left-handed or right-handed is a huge plus.

I give it only four stars because the silicon part on the handle has a tendency to get loose and I lose suction in the middle of pumping.

Note for Avent bottle users:  You can buy, for about $10.00, a set of adaptors (I bought mine at Buy Buy Baby) that allow you to attach the wide Avent bottles right to this or any of the other similarly styled Medela pumps"

I am staying at home with my child number 2 and only needed something for occasions.  This pump seems to work great.  It is obviously quiet and there is no hassle of the tubes, electrical outlet, etc.  I did notice however that when used more frequently while trying to teach my 7 month old to take a bottle that it made my nipples soar.  It could have just been me since I was not used to pumping that much.  Other than that it is great and I plan to use it for a weekend away next month. I was concerned that my hands would get tired, but it is really easy to use!  It is nice to be able to use discretely in the car as well."

Easy to use and clean!,"September 18, 2006",San Jose Mom,"San Jose, CA United States","I got this pump because I wasn't sure if I would need an electric as a stay-at-home mom. This pump is easy to use and clean. The ergonomic pump handle is pretty easy on the hands and wrist (I could pump even when I had tendonitis which hurt when I moved my thumb). It does not take up much room when disassembled so it'll be great for travelling. I'm not that thrilled about the soft comfort flange that is provided. I prefer the regular plastic Medela flanges that come with their electric pumps. I find that I can get as much milk out of this manual pump as I can with the Medela Pump In Style electric in about the same time and this one makes a lot less noise (great for middle of the night pumping sessions to ease engorgement without waking my baby and husband up).

Also, just a note to some people having problems getting milk out with the Medelas... It may not be the pump itself but the size of the flanges. Every woman's breast and nipples are different sizes. Initially, I was using the standard 24mm flanges (suction cup things that go over your breasts). It was painful to pump and my milk would not come out even though I was engorged with plenty of milk. It would take me 2 hours just to get 2 oz of milk! I went to see a lactation consultant who suggested I try the next size up flanges (27mm). She got me one to try and it made a world of difference. I could immediately pump 2oz in under 5 mins. Now, I pump daily with my electric to stock up and can get 4 oz from both breasts in under 10 mins (estimate since I don't really time it cause it's so fast). I use either my electric of my manual depending on my mood, whether I need to double pump, if I need my hands free (then I use the electric) or if I'm going to pump somewhere besides my bedroom (i.e. living room while watching tv with my husband).

I am now planning to pump to donate my milk to a milk bank. This pump made a world of difference.  I think Medela makes flanges in 3 different sizes. The standard 24mm that comes with all their pumps, the 27mm and a 30mm."

It feels very similar to my baby's suckling and as a result my milk will let down sometimes 3 times during a single pumping. :)
To sum it up--It's fast, easy and effecient. I plan to take it with me in my diaper bag for whenever I need it.
I highly recommend this product to anyone needing a breast pump."

The other potties were too narrow from front to back, and I had to adjust him several times to get him situtated so that he could use the front guard.

Our family love Sleepsacks and we consider them Volvos, because of their safety value::

(1) Reduces the possibility of SIDs - not necessary to have a quilt or blankets in the crib with your baby when he/she is in a sleepsack.

(2) Soothes fussy babies - my nephews and nieces were always ready for Mr. Sandman as soon as they are in their sleepsacks - probably because of the ""cocoon""-like feeling (so similar to their time in their mommy's womb).  
They can roll around (once they are older, of course) and still sleep through the night safely, so you can get some sleep too without worrying about potential dangers in the crib.

Get 3 (2 small and 1 either Medium or Large) and you should be good to go.  The newborn size is better suited for preemies.  The choice for Medium or Large is negotiable because babies grow at different rates. "

I have a 2005 Honda CRV.  In the rear facing position the seat belt was not long enough to strap it to the seat.  My SUV only has the LATCH system on the side seats and not the middle seat.  I spoke to the car safety officier for the police department and he told me to place him in the side seat behind the passenger seat as this would be the safest place in regards to incidence of accidents since I could not use the middle position.  The reason he told me not to use the LATCH in the middle position (by using the side seats LATCH system)  since my SUV is not equipped with it is because the LATCH is connected to the car frame and if we were in an accident and the frame of the car bent it could tear his seat in pieces.  I was not aware that the LATCH was connected to the frame.  

So the officier told me that when he is able to be forward facing I should be able to put him back in the middle seat as it shouldn't require so much length of the seatbelt.

I love this seat and so does my son who is now 9 1/2 months.  It is very soft and cushy.  I probably wouldn't have bought the infant car seat if I was aware this seat could accomodate even a newborn.  

I would definately recommend this seat. It was very easy to install.

It does not have a cup holder and that is the only thing I wish it had for when he is older"

Initially, I wanted the Britax, but I didn't know anyone who had one and I was really afraid to spend $300 (including tax) on a seat. So we bought the Eddie Bauer. I didn't hate it, it was ok, but it did NOT fit in our car (Toyota Rav-4). So we gave that seat to my mother so she could use it on occaision when she babysits and we bit the bullet and bought the Britax - OH MY GOSH. We love it! It installed in like 2 minutes, I'm not kidding. I could not BELIEVE how simple it was. My son (who is now 6 months) LOVES it - he is so comfy and he can sleep in it without his head leaning way over like it did in the Eddie Bauer. He never cries when he is in it - it sits up straight enough that he can look around which he also loves. The fabric feels so wonderful and wipes clean pretty easily. I love the one hand strap adjustment and the velcro that holds the straps out of the way for boarding. We're planning a plane trip in May, and I can tell you we'll be taking this seat.

I'm also a big fan of being able to get my money's worth out of an item.  This chair really does grow with the baby and when he/she is too big to have the tray attached, just push it up the table and you have an instant booster seat.

When I first received it I thought I got scammed because it looks like nothing. But it does the job very effectively. It's super easy to attach and when not needed the shade pulls back out of the way. Depending on the angle of the sun, I can have it partially or fully extended. I've used ours for almost a year and it's held its shape. It also packs up very compactly for traveling. It's the best I've found for maximum sun coverage.

It fits both my full size Evenflo travel system stroller and my lightweight Peg Aria, which has a very small canopy. On my recommendation my cousin got one and it works on her full size and her small Zooper also. I've read other reviews complaining it doesn't fit but I've tried it on many strollers of friends and it works. I think you just need to be creative in how you tie it to the stroller. I expect this shade will work on most strollers.

I can see that some kids may dislike the reduced field of view when the shade is fully extended. I started using it when my daughter was only 3 months old so I think she got used to it. She's never had a problem with the reduced view. My cousin started using it recently on her 11 mos old and her baby doesn't fuss either.

I now give this sun shade to every friend with young kids. It's a great and inexpensive shower gift. It's one of those things you can't live without once you have it"

I had been using a light blanket and clothespins, but wouldn't you know, just as I got going at a good jogging pace, my daughter would remove a clothespin and the ""shade"" was no more.  I was stopping to fix it more than I was actually jogging.
With this sunshade, she can't undo it...although she tries!  I can pull it all the way down (as low as I can on my particular jogger) and she can still see out but is shielded from the sun.  I like the side pockets - great for keys and small items - and the velcro tabs are easy to use.
The only drawback - and this is such a minor issue, probably hardly worth mentioning - is that the shade doesn't fold up all nice and compact like the instructions say.  I wrestled with my shade for awhile before I finally got it folded up (it was a matter of ""doggone it, this thing isn't going to get the best of me!"")...and even then, it wasn't very stable.  My suggestion - keep the little bag it comes in and semi-fold it and store it in that.

I did buy it prematurely- our almost 3 year old wasn't remotely interested in using any potty, so it did sit around for a while.  But ever since she started using the potty (first hers, now ours w/ her seat), we have taken it with us everywhere.  Not just for the sanitary reasons, but every bit as much for the size.  We also use it with the pottys at her grandparents' houses or my husband's office potty which we're the only ones that use.  The couple of times (tonight included) that we've forgotten it & she had to go in public, it is a nightmare.  First there's the layers of seat covers, then and even worse is trying to position her little behind on that enormous seat with the big ol' opening in the front which means her legs have to be out at an angle so she doesn't end up right there.  Then she says it hurts from all her weight being in the two places where the seat goes across her.  Yes, I pinched myself in the beginning when we were in a hurry & I didn't have it down yet how it folded, but it was well worth it in my eyes.  Bottom line- I love it, I highly recommend it, I would be totally lost without it.  So worth three times (and more) what I paid for it"

The Primo seat isn't just a piece of plastic with a hole in the middle. It's thin and contoured to the shape of a little one's bottm. It fits snugly on the adult potty. It has rubber pads and plastic pegs on the underside to keep it from slipping when she sits down. I also like that either a boy or girl can use it, without extra parts to assemble or disassemble.

He is impossible to get to sleep without it. Even if I am staying somewhere else with him, this is a must pack! With it I can feed him, bathe him, and lay him down, push the button and leave the room. I rarely have to go back in and start it again he falls asleep to it so quickly. I only hope when he gets old enough to activate it himself that he doesnt stay awake just to watch it."

"B000JIMVV4:love_it,_needs_a_few_improvements_though:dp",B000JIMVV4,Fisher-Price Rainforest Peek-A-Boo Waterfall Soother: Baby,baby,3 of 3,4.0,"Love it, needs a few improvements though","January 4, 2007",dp,"Chicago, IL USA","This was a gift for my daughter and she LOVES it. She's mezmerized by the lights and movement and will cry when it turns off (she's still too little to reset herself). The characters are cute, the waterfall is very calming (even my husband and I stare at it), and the music and noises are very nice and relaxing.

I do think it has a few areas of improvement. 1) The straps are really hard to get on. 2)The timer is way too short - I am always having to reset it for my daughter 3)It would be nice if it could be positioned higher. The instructions say 7"" between soother and mattress is necessary which means that it has to go on the head of the crib instead of the side until my baby is old enough where I reposition the height of the mattress. So, unless she is positioned sideways she really doesn't get to see it well.

I really do like this item and it has been a lifesaver getting our little one to fall asleep in the crib (she's 10 weeks old now and has been using this for a month). I highly recommend it"

Cavalier,"BR, LA","Unlike the other reviews, I find these bags easy to use and convenient. The twist ties allow you to pump right into the bag which saves me from having to wash bottles everytime I pump. The other bags require you to pump into a bottle and then pour it into a bag which defeats the whole purpose. The medela bags also allow you to get all of the air out which can destroy the great quality of your milk if left inside. I store the bags upright (just in case, although I've never had a leaky bag) in a milk storage tray I bought from Babies R Us (the First Years brand). Once they are frozen, I put them in ziplock bags with the date written on them for easy retrieval when I need to defrost milk. When I am ready to defrost, I just stand them upright in a large bowl and let cold water run for about 5 minutes, and them pour into bottles. 
My baby never got the hang of breastfeeding, but I really wanted her to have breastmilk. She is 2 1/2 months old now, and I have been pumping milk since she was 3 days old. I eventually chose to bottlefeed exclusively, so I pump about 5 times a day. I use an entire pack of 50 bags in less than a week!!! I pump way more than she eats, so I have a lot of stored milk. Plently for when I go back to work and can't pump as often. Take it from someone who really knows. These bags are not difficult to use as everyone else will have you believe. If they were, I wouldn't use them considering how often I need to use them."

When my son started getting rowdy in a crowded public location, I was able to slip this harness on him very quickly and easily because of the strategically placed velcro.

The Prefolded diaper service diapers are definately the way to go too.  I couldn't do it if I had to fuss with folding.  Also - if you plan to cloth diaper - a MUST have is 4 - 6 diaper wraps (10$ for 2 @ BBrUs).  They are like plastic pants only with waterproof and cloth covering.  They also have velcro instead of pins.  My hubby (who hates wrapping anything) LOVES and OFFERS to change our newborn's diapers since he can easily handle the velcro wraps.

This was the narrowest seat I could find on the internet.  The baby body pad definitely is a must since there is very little padding in the seat cover.  It will work for a little while, but during the summer I'm sure the baby will not stand for that much cushion around her legs, as it will make her hot.  I'll have to figure something else out at that point.  The seat looks better than I expected and is about an inch less wide than the Titan.  The Titan definitely doesn't work in between the two boosters.  I can't see any use for the pillow, other than for looks.  I'm very happy with my entire purchase"

1. Our house gets chilly at night, and even with a little space heater in his room, I worried about him being cold with no blankets! The sleep sack is snuggly and warm. 

2. Our son moves constantly, awake or asleep. Any blanket you did use (even if it were safe) would never stay on him. The sleep sacks have never tangled or bunched up under him. 

3. This is silly, but it just looks so darling. I love to see him all ready for bed, in his PJs and sleep sack. 

Our son HATED the sleepers that were sacks at the bottom, I think they felt restrictive because he would kick and kick at them and cry. He has never minded the sleep sack, maybe having his PJs on under it helps him feel more comfy. 

I recommend this, and recommend getting a couple in each size so that you can throw one in the wash and have another ready."

They are wonderful. First I must say that they, obviously, do not confine the arms, so if your baby still gets startled by her jerky arm movements when trying to fall asleep he/she may not be ready for this yet. I am slowly making the transition from the Miracle Blanket over to this. My baby still needs the extra swaddling at night and when she is fussy, but she likes the freedom during her naps that this provides and likes to get at her fingers too. 

I did not find that my cotton sleep sack shrank. The zipper doesn't lay exactly flat on her, but I haven't found this a problem at all. 

I do feel the sizes run a bit small. My baby is wearing the small size and at 23"" has just about outgrown it. I'd recommend getting them one size above what you think you need. 

I don't like that there are no arm sleeves at all. I really would have liked the choice of putting her in one with or without sleeves. 

This cotton is so nice and light that I can't imagine it being any lighter without being to fragle to hold together. If you want one that is heavier, they come in fleece and quilted also, but remember that there are no sleeves.

I very much like that the zipper is ""upside down"". It undoes from the bottom which means you don't have to completely unzip your baby for diaper changes and the zipper tab doesn't poke into the baby's chin. 

BTW, if you try to put your baby's arms inside the sack instead of out the holes they will probably get them out the holes themselves - mine did."

It's a matter of an extra minute of your day for a few bottles.  It's a little strange at 1st (all the gadgets), but in no time it's no big deal I PROMISE!  I will always HIGHLY recommend Dr. Brown's bottles! "

Suh,,"After having tried every bottle brand we could find, we ended up preferring the Dr. Brown's.  They definitely reduced the amount of gas our baby was swallowing thus reducing the amount of spit up and burps.

The measurements on the bottles are spot on, thus mixing formula in them is really easy.

The bottles are very durable as are the nipples.  They take a beating and still look brand new, including the measurement markings.  I'm fairly certain the bottles we have will last until our baby is eating just solid food.
 
And yeah, the parts are a pain to clean.  But we can live with that.  It's not a huge, huge deal.

I will say that the Playtex disposables were just as good in terms of gas prevention, but we didn't feel good about throwing away all those plastic containers and the added cost of purchasing them.  As well, the measurements on them were wildly inaccurate and thus totally useless"

I guess I'm not as meticulous as some other reviewers on cleaning and sterilizing... I just follow the directions in the package and sterlized when I started out and then I've hand washed ever since. Now, let's face it, washing bottles is a pain regardless. Washing a few more parts is no big deal. It takes me approx. 30 seconds more to do the vent parts. And it's definitely worth the effort. The couple of times I've used the Medela bottles I could visibly see bubbles coming through the milk and rising to the top. Later my baby had lots of gas and spit up. With the Dr Browns bottles that NEVER happens. I don't even use the Medelas as backup ""emergency"" bottles anymore. I only use them to hold water if I'm taking a trip and need to bring some clean water from home to mix formula. The Dr Browns bottles are a godsend"

Garris,"Durham, NC USA","I must agree that I tried the others - from cheap to expensive - before finally getting to the Dr.Brown bottles.  I tried others that had the same claims - even a few gimmicks that would work in theory (VentAire).  I have only found success with the Dr.Brown bottles. These bottles will sometimes leak - until you get the hang of them and keep the inner-tube empty and the collar on not-so-tight.  Usually a gentle twist of the collar will empty the inner-tube and then you can twist it back on...but not too tight.  The disks help stop leaks during travel, but you really just need to work on keeping them upright.  Yes, more cleaning - and thank goodness for microwave sterilizers.  I simply handwashed and then boiled for the first child, but love my microwave steamer now.  The markings are fading on some of my bottles, but I believe that hand-washing has saved them a little.  I compared to Avent (which were only slightly cheaper - but had lots of ""transition to sippy cup"" type of advantages (or breast pump straight to bottle).  I still love my Doc Brown's and the complaints of scratched off markings applied to the other bottles, too.  I personally preferred the wide-neck because they seem to fit my baby better, but several friends like the standard.  We all agree that the Doc Brown's are lifesavers, though.  I give a 3 pk of the 8 oz size at every baby shower"

He is now 11 months and still fits in the infant carrier.  We like that the carrier can be used in multiple cars so we bought an extra base.  The stroller height seems great for my husband (6'2"") and for me (5'8"").  We don't feel like we are hunched over when pushing it.

The stroller seems like it folds very compactly, but it still doesn't fit into my VW Cabrio trunk (the trunk opening is just a bit small).  So we use it with my husband's car and we are thinking about getting a compact stroller that will fit in my car.

My major complaint is with using the stroller without the infant carrier.  Now that my son is older and wants to see everything around him, he doesn't like to recline.  The back is adjustable, but we can't get it to be fully upright, so he is always at a 20 degree angle recline.  He has started pulling himself forward and leaning on the tray.  It is OK for now, but I think he'll start to get annoyed and tired when sitting forward like this.

Overall I would recommend this stroller system"

Head to head comparison:

Criteria_____________Comment
1.Bottle Material______Avent stays clearer and is more dense.
2.Bottle Design_______Playtex curve shape is innovative.
3.Nipple Design_______Baby likes the Avent shape better. Avent nipple size is labeled more visibly.  The Avent recommended flow rate by age fits my baby more.
4.Vent system________Both work well.  No difference.
5.Assembly Ease______Avent has less parts, but the nipple is harder to assemble.  Avent recommends wetting the nipple before assembly. Slight advantage to Playtex.
6.Cleanning Ease______Avent has less parts.  This is a big timesaver for me.  Playtex has 2 more parts to clean.  It's a hassle if you are cleaning a lot of them.
7.Overall Quality______Avent bottle seems better constructed.

The new nipples have a raised edge that guarantees the nipple is tight in the collar. Then there is a lip that hugs the rim of the bottle to guard against leaks. The REALLY great thing is you can tighten these bottle to your hearts content. I tightened it as tight as I could and it didn't leak a bit.

Sullivan ""katsullivan""",Oregon,This works great on our huge king size bed that has a really thick mattress.  It also works well with no bed frame.  You just shove the horizontal legs in between the mattress and foundation boxes (or box springs) and it stays in place nicely.  Easy to add and take away and looks clean and streamlined.  Gives me piece of mind at night that my 10 month old baby won't be able to roll out of bed.  In the morning when he wakes though he stands up and shakes it so I have to get up right away and pick him up before he throws himself over the top of it.  It only works while the baby is sleeping but I don't think many potential buyers would expect more out of it anyway.  It's great- highly recommend

I usually put my daughter in her p.j.s and the in the blanket, but on really warm nights I just put her in this. Plus with it being a sack it allows her to move her feet around freely, which isn't the case when she wears feet p.j.s because with all her kicking her legs either get caught up in the croch area or the p.j.s get twisted around.

And it seemed like the liner needed replacing every couple of days, probably due to the ""twisting"" sausage effect.

I received this new Diaper Genie II as a gift for my newborn, and WOW.  It is truly easy to load the liner, and I used it from last Wednesday through this Tuesday before needing to empty it.  Emptying it was as easy as advertised, I slipped the liner through the cutter and tied off the top of the dirties and tied the bottom of the liner where we were starting over again.

At first, it took two hands to un-snap the lid and get it open because it was new, now after a week it has been adequately broken in, and it truly is a one-handed operation.  

Even though baby is a newborn, she's been producing some MASSIVELY stinky diapers.  Prior to receiving the Genie II, we were using a regular trashcan.  The Genie II has completely contained the smell since it has been in use, and my nursery is now blessedly odorless!

The liner situation is great.  Diapers do not come in contact with the actual container which is extremely sanitary, LOVE IT!  Also, it seems that you can safely stuff a LOT of diapers into each load which is great.

Bottom line, I give my highest recommendation for this product, 5 stars PLUS!!  This will be my signature shower gift to others from now on unless I get beaten to it"

Since our baby isn't due for another 6 weeks I didn't have these things out yet (because the cat would think I set it up for him).  Well, I only took out the ""mattress"" if you will.  And proceeded to try an put both sheets (just to make sure) on.  It is a tight fit but I also figured it would be since bunching around a baby's face is not something I would have wanted anyways.

The key to comfort is to spread the strap across the shoulder so the weight is distributed.  It makes running errands and work around the house so much easier. It positions your baby at the hip so you have more range of motion than if he was on your belly/chest as with other carriers.  I fully recommend the mei hip.  Though I would wait until your baby can hold his head up well as there is no head support so it is not for new babies.

I'm giving up and ordering another one. Not bad for every day use for 10 months though. 

My original review:
When our large 6 month old outgrew her tub we looked around at other inflatable tubs only to realize that the diameter they gave was for the outside so once it was inflated the actual tub size was even smaller than the infant tub we were using. We couldn't find the snug tub in any of the stores (Babies R Us carries their own brand, Baby Depot and Target only carried the Munchkin duck tub which is so small). 
With our 70 year old cast iron tub we definitely liked the idea of the inflatable tub to protect her little head from harm. She loves bath time so we wanted to make it as safe as possible. 

Well this tub is the answer. It is everything the reviewers have said - convenient (blow up once and store with suction hook), big (lots of room for toys and splashing), secure (fits very snugly, thus the name) and the bonus is obviously that you can travel with it. And if you pay the couple of dollars more to get the Snug Tub Deluxe versus the Snug Tub you get the toys. Not that I cared but she really does love the squeaking fish. So bath with peace of mind and have fun with the little one"

Because we have a soft mattress, I couldn't bear the thought of my daughter sleeping with us, so I spend a sleepless night in the recliner with her on my chest. 
 First thing the next day, we went to the store, and bought the snuggle nest. The selling points for use were the size, and the light. It fit perfectly between us on our king size bed, and the light allows me to breastfeed and change the baby without overstimulating her. And because I had had a c-section, it was wonderful not getting out of bed all the time. 
  Two weeks later, I was ready to put her in the bassinette again. The best part was, because of its size, the nest fits in it perfectly. My daughter never knew the difference between bed and basinette. I am planning on using it to transition her to the crib as well.

The obvious use is in bed with parents. It is a perfect fit our full size bed (admittedly we're not the kind of people who feel the need for lots of room to spread out).

I also put my daughter in this nest during nap time. The sleep positioners keep her feeling snuggled and cozy. It's also convenient if you're the type of parent who likes to have baby near at all times. This little bed can be carried from one room to another without waking baby.

I found it wonderful for transitioning to the crib. I simply placed the nest in the crib and she felt right at home!

This wrap is absolutely amazing however. I would recommend it for when you will need your hands free for an extended period of time. I use it for walks, traveling, and around the house if my baby just wants that close contact or is fussy. Once you get the hang of how to wrap this you can get them in and out in just over a min. My baby takes super long naps when in this and is so comfy and so am I. My other carrier that I have hurts my back after awhile and I suffer for days; never with this carrier. There are so many positions for this too. I found a website with a European carrier that shows better pictures and one more position, same idea.[...]I also found that it is easiest to put it on when first folding the wrap in half lengthwise, then spreading it out when secure. Though it is not as easy to nurse with the baby in this carrier, it is pretty easy to take them out and put them back once you are used to the sling. If I had it my way I would have this (for long periods up and about, and fussy babies, or for those with bad backs), a sling (for newborns and nursing), and a backpack (only for short trips, like laundry or carrying groceries up). If I had to pick one however this above all would be it!! One more thing, it is ok to wear this in warm weather, just dress accordingly (you and your baby). The pocket is a plus as well. Oh, and I do find it easier, once on, to get baby in and out of than a back pack or front carrier. This also is suitable right off the bat for new borns and many stages there after"

well i bought it.  our son has been in this carrier since he was born in October, we are in april and he still rides in it and he weighs almost 19lbs.  and babies that are in these types of carriers seem to be the happiest.  they spend 40 weeks with you, what makes you think when they are born they want to be away from you.
it's also great for babies with colic

it is the best wrap EVER!!!

1. this creates no pressure points at all!!! you DON'T feel it in your shoulders or lower back. as a massage therapist i highly recommend it b/c it does not ruin your posture  
i do feel his weight in my thighs - which for me is fine - my legs are getting stronger

2. i breastfeed him with the shoulder strap hovering over my breast while i hold him in my arms - wherever we go - restaurants, etc..  and people never notice they think he is sleeping

3. you can put the baby in different positions

4. they take the best naps in it

5. be prepared for all the attention and questions as to where you bought it and how it feels

6. it it soo easy to put on, but you MUST WATCH THE VIDEO it comes with.  once you get the hang of it - it' a breeze - i put it on in less than 30 seconds

7. and instead of looping the wrap through the rings to hold it in place  i just tie it into a knot

8.  you have TWO free hands

It's true that the wipes are warm only for a couple of seconds, but really, how long does it take to wipe a baby off? The owners manual states that the warmer is not meant to produce hot wipes. I think it is great to have something to remove the chill from the wipes, which should be comforting to the baby. When I first used it, I didn't add the water as suggested in the manual, just to see how it would work. The wipes did start to dry out after awhile but then I added the 1/2 cup of water and haven't noticed any more drying. All of the wipes are still moist. I haven't noticed any discoloration either and I am using Huggies wipes. My baby hasn't arrived yet but I wanted to try this out to see for myself how well it did or did not work.

After nine months of daily use, the receiver stopped working, but this is decent value for the price.

Morales,"Dallas, TX USA","We purchased this in anticipation of our trip to Yellowstone next year. The pack is very comfortable when adjusted correctly. I find that if you adjust it right, most of the weight is placed on your hips. Our 9 month old girl loves to ride in it. She even fell asleep once. She seems to like the rhythm of our walk and even ""sings"" as she gets bounced around. We were worried that she wouldnt like it because she can be a pretty difficult baby (she was born with acid reflux). However, we have had it for several months now and she makes no complaint when we load her up. She doesnt even mind sitting in the pack when it is on the ground.

I have very short hair and the baby likes to try to grab it (too short to really grab). Interesting enough, she never tries to grab my wife's hair. I would suppose that you may want to invest in a hat if your baby likes to pull hair.

There are lots of pockets, although if you are wearing the pack, the pockets are very difficult to access, even the ones on the hip. The hip pockets seem too far back (I have a 38"" waist). My wife has a smaller waist and doesnt seem to have the problem with the waist pockets that I do.

When taking off the pack, the baby seemed secure and getting her on and off was no problem.

We dont use the hood. Its not too difficult to put on. Just takes a little time to figure it out.

I am 5'10"" and the waist belt at near the lowest setting is just right for me. My wife is 5'7"" and she likes the waist belt setting near the middle-top.

At first, it felt awkward walking with the weight, but after a couple of walks, we got used to it. Now we fight for who gets to wear the pack when we walk. 

Im glad we got the pack. We cant wait till we get to load her up at Yellowstone"

I only wish I bought it sooner. I bought a cheap breast pump at first, but it broke down after only a month of use. Due to daycare issues, I had to leave my son with my parents for a week, so I had to pump exclusively. After the second day with the cheap pump, my milk production cut in half to about 3 oz total from both sides every 3 hours. Then I had to wait longer to even get that much! I went out and bought this pump out of desperation and couldn't be happier. It took me about 4 pumping sessions for my body to get into a rhythm, but then it was great. I started pumping more milk in less time than the cheap pump. Now I use the pump 2-3 times a day at work and occasionally on the weekends.

A couple of tips: If you have larger breasts, buy the larger shields. I am a D cup and the 27 mm shields are perfect for me. As soon as I switched to the larger shields, the minor discomfort I had pumping went away and I started getting about another ounce of milk out on each side in the same amount of time. Also, to use the dual function, turn on the pump before you put the shields to your breast. I've been doing that and I haven't had a problem positioning them correctly with the pump on.

I've never had a problem with cleaning the pieces. I make sure and give the pieces a really good washing once a day, but in between each pumping, I wash everything quick with soap and my hand and let it dry. I've never had a problem with the pieces not drying in time before the next pumping. Also, when I bought my pump, they included an extra set of membranes. You can also buy microwave sterilization bags from Medela to clean everything in, including the membranes, which can't go in the dishwasher. Also, since the pump works with any bottle, you don't have to continually wash one bottle to use with the pump. I just stick nipples on the bottles I pumped in and take them to daycare, then grab the next set of clean bottles out of the cabinet for the next day.

I must say, this pump saved my milk supply. I even have a freezer full of extra breastmilk. Even though it is much more expensive than some of the other pumps, I've saved more than its cost in formula, so it's been worth it financially, not to mention the extra benefits of breastmilk that my son has continued to have. I plan on keeping mine for my next child and I would definitely recommend this product to other moms"

I was able to pump discreetly at work and cool my milk in the attached cooler.  If we took a trip, I could take the pump and pump in the car using the battery attachment or even in our hotel room.  At one time the pump was not suctioning properly.  When I called Medela, they were so helpful.  They assistemd me while I was on the phone to get it working properly.  It still didn't work so they offered me a new pump in exchange for my old one.

It looks professional and I can even fit my lunch in the top. I also love how quickly I can set it up in my office to pump. It is a bit loud so don't try to use it on conference calls unless you hide it under you desk and close the flap. And even then you'll want to check it with a friend listening on the phone for it first. 

Our battery pack didn't work at first and we didn't check it until we were on the road, so check yours. The white membranes also must be kept very clean and the yellow tips they go in. Even a little bit of old milk will completely kill the suction. But it is worth it even with this issue. 

Buy it from your lactation nurse at the hospital and then you have someone to give you guidance on how to use it and deal with any issues you have with parts. Although you shouldn't have many."

I have the lite version which I used all spring and summer (air conditioned car) and now this one for the fall and winter!  

Some have commented on how easy it is to move baby in the bundle me from carseat to stroller - I have to disagree I would just get a second one for the stroller.  The velcro in the back that holds it into the carset will wake up a sleeping baby if you try to remove the whole thing with baby inside.

We started out using the Playtex Drop-ins system and that worked fine for us until we were about 1.5 months old.  Then suddenly there was lots of gas and screaming at feedings.  I switched to the Playtex Vent Aire bottles and the screaming stopped, but there were issues with the nipples and that just wasn't working out for us either.  Baby was spending more calories than she was taking in with level 1, and drowning with level 2.  Plus there were wierd extra parts to clean and keep up with.  It was a temporary answer to our prayers but still not what we were looking for.

Because we have a preemie, changing her formula isn't an option because she needs the nutrients in this special formula we are giving her and she is continuing to gain weight.  So the real issue has become trying to make feeding more comfortable for her and us.  As a final resort (I had spent so much on bottle systems that didn't work out that I had almost given up), I gave the Avent feeding system a try.   

It has worked wonders.  Baby eats in an appropriate amount of time now, there are only the standard parts on any bottle to clean and manage, baby tolerates the nipple and flow well (we use both level 1 and 2 nipples).  Best of all are the special ""Variable Flow"" nipples, sold separately-we use those for feedings where we have to mix in rice cereal and they allow the cereal through, not too fast but no clogs either.  I like not having to ""alter"" the flow of the regular nipples with toothpicks, etc. because once you do this, there's no going back.  The Variable Flow nipples solve that problem and leave the other nipples unscathed for normal feeding needs.  Also, our baby was addicted to the Soothie pacifiers at the hospital.  We have tried Nuk, Mam, Gerber and she wouldn't accept any of those.  But she is accepting the Avent pacifiers included with this newborn starter set.

My advice to parents looking for bottles to help with/solve feeding issues-buy the smallest number possible and give it 5 days.  If it looks good on day one and is the same kind of good by day 5, it's safe to sink more money into it.  But if it isn't going to work out, it will be obvious by day 5 or sooner that you haven't found ""The Answer"".  Avent's bottles have passed this test for us and I would highly recommend them.

Additionally, if your baby is experiencing colic and or reflux, see fussy baby dot org for tips and ideas.  Also I would recommend a specific brand of gripe water called Colic Ease (all brands are not the same, see their ingredient page to see why).  The fussy baby site and this gripe water teamed up with Avent bottles have really helped us out work through our feeding issues.  Good luck"

I did run into some leaking problems that came from the white cap screwing onto the bottle.  I found if I tightened the bottle a bit more it eliminated the leaks completely.  After figuring this out, we had no more problems.  We are expecting our second child in a few months and I have started to buy Avent again.  Our first son did not have a whole lot of gas problems.  Of course he was gassy at times, so I can't say he had no gas, but he didn't appear to have so much gas where it was bothering him.  I really liked the wide bottle with Avent.  It made it more comfortable for me to hold then later on when our son got to be old enough the wide bottle made it easy for him to hold.  Avent also has handles that attach to the bottles when your baby/toddler gets old enough to hold the bottle by themselves.  The handles were wide and colorful and made holding easy for little hands.  The nipples I did feel at first were a bit hard, but our son never had any problems taking it.  Of course, this will vary amoung babies. After just purchasing a 3 pack of 4 oz bottles for impending baby #2 I opened up the package after seeing the advertisement for ""extra soft nipple"" and it is indeed softer then it was 5 years ago.  If you are looking to save money, I suggest either buying very few 4oz bottles or simply buying the 9 oz or even 11 oz bottles instead as they outgrow the 4 oz very quickly.  We had no problems cleaning these bottle as well and they held up very well.  We never had to replace them."

By the recommendation of our pediatrician, we went out and bought a new set of Dr. Brown's bottles---kine of pricey, but WORTH every penny!!  With Avent, my son was getting super gassy and colicky.  He would cry so hard with gas pains that he'd clinch his little fists, crunch his little legs to his tummy and practically go hoarse.  Burping, mylicon and gripe water didn't even help.  Our days and nights were sleepless--he wouldn't nap because he was crying--and our nights would average about 3-4 hours of sleep.  Now, with Dr. Brown's---our son is a NEW little man.  He STILL gets gas, but not like he did with the Avent bottles.  All it takes is a couple of little pats on his back and he gives us a couple of good burps and he's out into LA LA land---he's now able to take his naps and has been sleeping anywhere from 6-8 hours through the night now for the past 2 weeks---and he's only 1 month old. :)  

For some reason, when he was feeding from the Avent, he would suck uncontrollably, I'd see lots of bubbles in his bottle and in the nipple and I could hear him sucking all that air in.  With Dr. Brown's, he has WAY more controlled sucking, it's much more rhythmic and no air bubbles in the nipple!

I have no idea if these bottles help a colic/gasey baby. My baby was never like that. I considered these bottles because I hated that my son had to suck till he could suck no more then let go of a nipple so air could back into a regualar bottle. So I started looking for a bottle that didn't have nipple collaspe. First we tried Playtex. They worked but were extremely hard to mix powdered formula in because the liners held exactly 8 oz (also expensive liners). Then I switched to Avent, thought it was my dream come true bottle. Until they started leaking no matter how I screwed on the ring. I finally figured out the problem, the skirts on the nipples warp after very little use. So I ended up constantly buying new nipples and never knowing when we would get a whole bottle dumped on us. So then Dr Brown came out with these wide neck bottles. After some reading the directions and trial and error; this is it: The Bottle for Us!! This is how we did it; you can't use the valve while mixing formula or warming or the bottle will leak. So water goes in the bottle and just the ring, nipple and cap get screwed on. The valve goes in a zip-lock bag. About ten minuetes before the bottle is needed. I but the formula in the bottle in and shake. In about ten minuets all the bubbles are down and I incert the valve and feed. No leaks. I have an aunt who premixes her formuala in two days worth of bottles and puts them in the fridge ( once again leaving the valves out). Then she gets them out, swirls a little, takes off the top, microwaves for 30 secs, incerts valve, checks tempreture and feeds. No leaks either. The only time I have ever had a leak is when I mixed or heated formula with the valves in which the directions say not to do. Like I said this is what works best for us"

When i tried our baby in the big tub he cried and didnt like it so i tried him back in his infant tub and he was fine. I realized it was a matter of security for him. The large tub was just so over-whelming. He loves to squeek the duck and play with tossing rings. Price is just right to! Just be careful when you inflate tub because it inflates in sections.

I will give this warning:  If you are buying for another person, make sure you check the expiration date.  If their baby is not due for a while, you better get one with a later expiration date.

With the Playtex One-Step storage system, I pump directly into the liner and stick it in the fridge, and then I can pop it in a nurser when it's time to feed. My husband and other caregivers are quite glad at the ease of putting it all together when they're juggling a crying baby.

As advice to others, I wonder whether the original nurser gift set might be better, because it comes with multiple different kinds of nipples, whereas this set only comes with the silicone slow flow. We've lucked out, in that my baby seems happy with it and switches easily from breast to bottle and vice versa; however, it might have been handy to be able to try different kinds to see which the babe likes best. The shells in this set are more modern looking, but I can't see how that matters. I'm pretty sure the pieces for both are interchangeable. Nice that the silicone nipples in this set (and all the other pieces; latex nipples are less hardy) are dishwasher safe, and can be repeatedly boiled for sterilization if desired. 

The short shells in this set are fine, and it's easier to reach in the bottom to squish the liner with your fingers (to help it collapse; the drop-in liners are relatively more shape-holding than regular liners, so they can suck in air), but usually my baby has more than 4 oz at a sitting; in the 8oz size shell, the burper is nice (it's hard to reach in when the liner is less full), but it doesn't squish the liner all the way, so we end up taking off the shell and using our fingers for the last 2 oz or so. I have never had any problem with leaking.

I like the disposable bit of this system, since the nipples, collars, and lids take up enough space and cleaning effort without having a bunch of bottles around as well. Liners are pricy if you use a lot (about $5 for 50 at Walgreens), but since we only use a bottle a day, it doesn't seem like much. They also freeze easily.

Scull,,"After doing our pre-baby research, we registered for and received this set. We started using it with no problems, and then my daughter started having problems with gas. Naturally, we blamed it on the bottles. Many bottles and wasted dollars later, we returned to the Premium Nursers and have never looked back. In fact, the more I watch other moms with other bottles, the happier I am.

Sure, you spend a few extra bucks on liners. But the time and energy and dishwasher costs you save are well worth it. We have 4 bottle shells that we use and about 10 nipples. The shells rarely get dirty and so rarely have to be washed. Likewise for the rings and caps. We usually run a load of nipples with the dishwasher every day and that's it. Empty liners pop out with no mess and are recyclable to boot.

When we go out, I pack 1 pre-assembled bottle, and an extra liner and nipple/ring/cap setup. It weighs nothing and takes up way less space than multiple bottles. On the fly I can just pop out the dirty liner, throw it away, pop in the new one and screw on the new top. 

As an added bonus - I think my husband may actually have invented this ingenius use for the Premium Nurser. Note: this can only be done with the Playtex brand liners, not generics. When my daughter was struggling with swallowing too much air, my husband figured out that we could fill the liner with the desired amount of milk, screw on the nipple, and then squeeze all of the air out of the liner, collapsing it down until it was vacuum-tight with only milk in it. Keeping a finger over the nipple hole, pop on the airtight cap. Voila - a completely air-free meal for baby. This really helped cut back on her air swallowing. Generic liners work fine for all other purposes.

Last but not least, we like so many other parents, felt that many brands were drowning our daughter in milk. The Playtex slow- flow nipples worked great for her. She is still using them at 4 months"

Yinger ""Mommy Yinger""","Picktown, OH USA","My husband and I have tried many different bottle types and brands and have decided that these are the best. My 6 week old daughter adjusted well to them. The original brown nipples wear out very quickly but, the silicone ones are much nicer and will last longer. These bottles are very easy to use and clean. My husband prefers the soft bottle liners over the preformed dropins. The soft ones haven't leaked on us once but the formed ones have slipped out from under the ring a couple of times spilling formula everywhere. The formed ones also make it harder to screw the lid on tight enough causing leaks. The soft liners might take a little bit longer to put on the bottle and deal with, but in the long run it takes less time because you don't have to go change your clothes every time the preformed ones leak. They are worth every penny I spent on them. Even though they may cost more than standard bottles because of having to buy the liners, they help prevent gas and colic. THey are absolutely wonderful"

Being able to put the straps across the child at the proper height (adjustable by the way) is extremely important for their safety - and since you can use the straps in the car, they go right over bulky winter clothing without having to readjust like our old seat.

We had no desire to trek out to the trash can at every change (especially those first weeks at all hours of the day and night!).  Basically for me it came down to Diaper Genie or the Diaper Dekor. I considered the price of refills, reviews, and the advice of a friend who works in daycare and went with the Diaper Dekor.

We love it!!!  It has done a wonderful job and the refills have lasted longer than I would have ever imagined.  The dekor came with one fill- and we've not gone through an entire box of refills yet.  Our daughter is 7 months old now, she's eating solids and some of those diapers are pretty nasty.  However, a quick change and drop into the Dekor and no more smell.  Plus, it is just as easy to toss in wipes and other related trash items instead of wasting refills or tracking it through the house.  

The ONLY time we've ever had a smell-- is when we've had it open and the inner doors open to put in another diaper.  As soon as it closes-- no more smell.

Those who swear by their Diaper Genies-- I don't think it is an accident that the recent redesign of the DG basically resembles the DD in design and function.  I personally think we'll get a lot more use out of the DD down the line.  

I highly recommend the Diaper Dekor for your nursery!!"

McDaniel,"OH, United States","We've been using our Diaper Dekor for more than two years now.  In all that time, the Dekor has held up wonderfully.  After hearing friends complain about the two-handed requirements of Diaper Genies and the like, we went with the Dekor because the easy, one-handed operation was appealing -- just stomp on the pedal and throw in the diaper.  We were also glad that the product was so well-reviewed; it turns out that those good ratings are very well deserved.

Our Dekor works so well that we keep it in the family room, where we spend most of our time (bonus: we don't have to run upstairs every time we need to change a diaper!) -- and we certainly wouldn't do that if there were an odor problem.  The only time we've noticed any odor has been during the summer, when it's really hot and the contents get... ah... ripe faster, and even then it was only when the lid was open.  Other than a few super-hot weeks each year, we empty the Dekor once a week and all is well.

The interior of the Dekor, where the diapers are collected, has gotten a touch stinky over the last couple years, but you don't smell it until you open the door to empty the unit.  A little Lysol helps, but frankly, as long as the smell doesn't ""escape"" the Dekor, it's a non-issue to us -- and so far, so good!

The refills may seem more expensive than other systems, but they last FOREVER.  With my first son, we used only four refills in two years.

I highly recommend the Dekor, and wouldn't even consider another diaper disposal system.  Hope you're as happy with it as we are"

For one thing when you use it as a sling the letter ""P"" will turn over and face your shoulder.  To make sure the cord stopper does not loosen the instructions tells you to tie a knot in the remaining length of the cord.  
My son loves to be held.  We were in Children's hospital for 10 days and I held him a lot to keep the monitors from going off.  So now he loves me to still hold him.  This sling allows me to hold him and do other things.  One important thing is to play with my 3 year old son."

First of all, the liners last a long time and are easy to use and refill.  I really like how there is a very handy and very child safe cutting blade for the liners mounted onto the inside of the lower changing door.  I noticed some reviewers stating that they had problems with the item controling odor, while most other's have had no trouble at all.  Taking this into account, I purchased my Diaper Dekor with an open mind.  

I had no trouble for the first 5 months.  Then I also noticed an odor in my son's room, even when the unit was empty, and after I had wiped down the outter lid, inner lid, and flaps, inside and out.  Then it occured to me:  There was condensation on the inside of the liner bag when I emptied it and then used the blade to cut it.  I wondered if maybe the bacteria or something from the moisture was now on the blade and then causing the smell.  So, I pumped some alcohol based hand sanitizer onto the blade to see what would happen.  The smell went away.  I then thought, ""That's just too easy, and a bit crazy.  It can't be that simple"".  So, I waited until I noticed the smell again a couple of months later.  I used the hand sanitizer again, and lo and behold, the smell once again went away.  

The gist of it is, if you're going to put a wast material into something where it's going to sit for a few days before you get rid of it, it is going to start to decompose.  The Diaper Dekor is great at controlling those icky germs and bacteria and keeping them in one safe place.  The problem is, decomposisition creats heat, and the more decomposing solid matter, and the longer is sits, the warmer it all becomes.  So, if the temperature inside your waste recepticle is warmer (which it will be) than the surrounding room temperature, condensation will form. So when you cut the liner to empy the unit, clean the blade.  No odor.  No problems"

We own both the fleece and cotton versions, and I prefer the fleece - it does not get loose as quickly as the cotton one does.

Despite the name, this is not a swaddler by itself for any but the most placid and plump babies.  Our kid can easily work his arms out (usually through the slit between the arm wrap and the bottom pouch) if he is fussy.  

However, we still use this daily - on TOP of a swaddle done with a recieving blanket.  This way, the swaddle does not come undone.  Yes, you could do the same with a diaper pin, but things stay together much longer and much neater with this than with a diaper pin (or even with a second swaddle done with another recieving blanket.

I haven't found a good way to use it with a car seat in which I feel comfortable - a swaddled kid has his legs together, doesn't he? - but we do sometimes use it, cocoon style, in a Baby Bjorn or sling carrier, and it can be quite magical at being soothing"

The velcro is a life saver because most babies can break out of a blanket you've swaddled them in and then you worry that the blanket will smother them in the middle of the night. The only issue we had was when he got a little older and stronger, he would bust out his arm. Usually he would continue sleeping but sometimes it would wake him up. I'd take that any day over trying to deal with a regular blanket. It has an amazing calming effect and helps prevent them from waking themselves up with their arm and leg movements.

Knight ""new mom""","Atlanta, GA","I *LOVE* this product.  It's a far better velcro swaddler than the other brands because it uses bigger patches of velcro.  In comparison to a blanket, this is much easier to use and provides much more durable swaddles.  I'm quite good with a blanket, but by six weeks of age, my son could wriggle out.  On the other hand, at three months, he's never wriggled out of the cotton flannel Swaddleme.

However, even in cold weather, the microfleece is too hot.  Several times I've felt under the blanket to find my son sweaty.  It's even worse when we combine the swaddle with a sling.  On the other hand, the cotton knit (solid colors) blankets are too stretchy - my son quickly converts his knit Swaddleme into a toga, leaving both arms flying free.  The cotton flannel (gingham prints) has less stretch than the other two fabrics, and plenty enough cover to keep a baby warm at indoor temperatures.  It is trickier to find, but worth the search.

The microfleece Swaddleme does, however, make a great non-swaddle blanket on cold days, particularly when the baby is in a front carrier.  The velcro is quite versatile. "

My only thumbs down on this product is I notice that with repeated use my son can wriggle his arm out and it does it looser with age.

My son doesn't need to be swaddled so tightly and likes to have his hands free, now that he is 4 months old, but I will sometimes use the small size for naps. You can wrap it lower on the body to secure the baby's legs, but they can have their hands free. 

I have lots of friends having babies right now; the Swaddle Me blanket is always included as part of their gift. "

This is an umbrella stoller with all the bells and whistles.  It is light enough but yet has heft.  There is a detachable canopy... basket underneath... mesh baggy bottle holder... winter boot... rain cover and sun shade.  There is so much.  Where the child lays there is even a way to elevate the legs... you usually don't get that with the lighter strollers.  If it gets too hot in the summer, you can even remove some of the fabric on the seat so that it is ventilated.  I would say my favorite part is that on the canopy there is a zipper for parents to store what is necessary.  First time I have seen that.

Haven't really tested it yet, but it seems to roll smoothly, close down easily and open just as easily.  I love the fact that I can push up the levers on the back of the stroller with my barefoot.... usually it hurts through my boots.  Great buy... you won't regret it.  The navy one really does look black, but the canopy seems navy.  The accents that look hot pink in the picture are actually red.  Good looking"

The Bjorn is the original and I think the key to their popularity is the simplicity of the design.  A lot of other brands have added things (e.g. pockets, extra buckles or straps, multiple carrying positions, etc.) to try and differentiate.  Bjorn has kept it simple.  Both my partner and I use the same one (easily adjusts for different size people) pretty much everywhere including sweeping and mopping the floors.  The boy loves facing forward where he can see everything.

It's nice to have insetead of a playard because you can sit in there with the kid and hang out with him. It gives him alot of room to play and crawl. He can stand up and hold on to the sides. He even stood by himself! The other cool thing is that all the toys are in one spot! We have two baskets of toys in there for him to play with.

This is portable and light. It's kind of a pain to reshape;(which is why it got 4 stars) but once you have it together, it's pretty sturdy. It's also indoor-outdoor, which is great for people with backyards, decks or pools.

Folds up very compactly. You could easily store this in a closet when not in use.

My favorite feature is the price! I only paid about $35, while many similar gates sell for $100. I cannot give this product 5 stars, because it is a little difficult to install properly.

The swivel-wheel in front makes it super-easy to maneuver, turn, and steer.  

I often see parents with the older-model BOB (pre-swivel) and they have to make awkward turns by rolling their joggers onto the back wheels.  What a pain! I'm SO glad I got the Revolution! 

Ours is the ""Mesa Orange"" color, but I think it reminds me of Tomato Soup, Reddish Orange, and not too bright. 

It reclines enough for my son to nap, and has a flap so I can look in on him. The only thing I would change is that the basket at the bottom is hard to access when my son is in the jogger. Also, if there were some sort of iPod attachment/pocket that would be a HUGE plus!  (Like the Jeep stroller has) 

But, I purchased some folding speakers, and used velcro to seucure them (temporarily) to the canopy. Now we have tunes on our walks!  I use my console (purchased seperately) to hold my cell phone, keys, iPod, and sippy cup and water bottle.

Some of the FP bouncers have very stiff legs so they do not bounce easily.  The legs curve/bow out from the seat (check out image of product).  Because of this leg design you can easily place your foot and bounce the baby.  My baby will fall asleep with me bouncing and then I turn on the vibration and leave her be.

I wasn't crazy about the PINK design, but I know the leg design is offered with a Bunny print as well, but that appears to be discontinued.  The key thing is to find the FP bouncer that has the legs that curve/bow out from the seat base"

I use it with the Safe Seat, which fits wonderfully without any adjustments (just use the seatbelt!).

We have a Peg car seat, and I didn't want to schlepp my Peg stroller through the airport, etc. while on vacation. To my surprise, I find that I use my Combi Flash much more often than my Peg stroller. It's very lightweight, is very easy to pop open, and has held up well through various trips. I also like that it has a handlebar that goes all the way across, because it is much easier to steer (especially one-handed).  My husband also had a tricky time removing the plastic parts that you have to pull off in order to make this work with the Peg; once they were off, though, the stroller has been a breeze. 

I would give one word of warning: you do have to be careful with this stroller that it is (1) popped all the way open (there's an audible clicking noise when this happens) and (2) that the car seat carrier is strapped in.  The Peg carseat sort of just rests on top of the carrier, which makes it a bit susceptible to tipping over on uneven surfaces."

At first I was looking at pumps that cost around the $70 range.  I am so glad that I decided to spend the extra money!  My daughter was not too keen on breastfeeding and it just turned into a horrible experience that I'd like to forget.  

The hospital that I was in provided the Medela pump.  Ouch!!!  My breasts were sooo sore from using that thing, it was not comfortable at all!  The cups for the breast is this hard plastic and when it would pump, my poor nipples were getting so sore and then i had to use nipple cream to make them feel better.  I actually could not have anything on my breasts while i was at the hospital because they were so sore.  It made me so grouchy and I just let everything hang out.  I didn't care who came in the room!!!  

When I came home and started using the Playtex pump, it was such a relief!  The cups for the breasts have a soft rubbery feel to them and they didn't stretch or pull my nipples while pumping.  The 5 speed/suction controls are very nice to have.  It does come with a storage kit but it only provides 4 storage thingy's.  I had to buy 2 extra storage kits so that I had enough contraptions to use for storing milk.  I really hope that makes sense!  And then there's the liners.  I had liners coming out of my ears!  I guess that's how Playtex makes their money, you have to buy tons of liners (and don't forget the storage kits).  The pump is a little loud when the suction is set higher.  I used it for 4 months and everything worked great.  

I definitely recommend this pump.  I would have given it 5 stars but my only gripe is spending the extra money on storage kits and the countless number of liners you have to buy.  BUT... It is a world of difference between Medela and Playtex. "

I'm the proud mom of almost 5 month old twin girls and I used hospital pump which got me bleeding on second day. Problem, flangies were too small for me and they didn't have anything larger. Embrace is the right size for me and after getting home from the hospital on the 3rd day I have been married to my pump 24/7. 

We had latching problems so I was never able to fully nurse my babies, but with Embrace I'm still going strong after 5 months and pump 50-60oz/day. I have had NO problems with my pump, no motor failures, no tube problems, nothing. I've pumpped with it like I said, almost 5 months on average 5 times a day. It may be a bit noisy... my husband calls it a respirator :) But I would not switch my pump to Medela or any other for anything.

I'm sorry some of you have had bad experience with your Embrace, not everybody's body is made the same and not every manufacturing lot is the same, I'm sure of that. This pump has been a life saver for me and my girls and I have no plans on stopping pumping.

I started with the 4oz bottles that came with the system and eventually graduated pumping into Dr.Brown's 8oz bottles. I love the fact that I can pump directly to both narrow and widemouth bottles. I've never cleaned my pump nor bottles in the dishwasher, but wash them by hand.

I started working when my girls were 9 weeks old, so I guess I can be called a WAHM (I'm a web developer and work from home) and I didn't notice any drop in supply during the work day compared to the weekend.

WORTH EVERY CENT! Try, compare... Not every Medela user is happy with their pump either. There is no product out there that is going to satisfy everybody. Embrace just is better"

Like with most strollers, the canope on this stroller is almost useless. Why is it so hard for the companies to figure out what we Mom's really want? A functionable canope would be one thing for example. On most strollers they are a joke.
So I bought this sunshade.
Positive: folds up flat and easily;attaches easily (though you may have to fiddle a bit to find the best position);side pockets are a nice extra and help to weigh the shade down some as well ( and you can perhaps hide some goodies in there because they are really not easy to spot );it shelters from the side as well;
Negative:
Hello.. a slight wind and this thing bends backwards or moves sideways;
When the sun comes from the front, while setting, you can't really pull it down far enough to protect your children.
Living on an island we deal with wind all the time and so it is not as practical as I would like this shade to be.
But still would recommend it over leaving the child just exposed.
Perhaps if you have less wind to deal with you really will like this shade.
I gave it a 4 star because it does protect my children and that is what matters.
You deal with the negative points,but I wished it would have been designed for all weather. I don't see how you can attach a weight and still allow it to stand up correctly.
The material is too thin for that.
But I am open for ideas and suggestions.
I don't have problems folding the stroller together while shade is attached. Perhaps that is just a matter of trying and see what you prefer and like.
All in all it is worth the money and afford because your little ones deserver and need the proctection.
Till the strollers are made with better canopes, we will have to rely on something like this.
I also have the Peg Perego Aria stroller and had bought the single one for that one.
Same issue, problems with wind but otherwise a nice protection.
And yes you will have to fold it back when you put baby in.
Perhaps that was the main concern of the designer. Easy acess to the baby.

I wish it was bigger though, so it would protect a larger area.  And I wish it was thicker.  Since our dining room is carpeted, the wheels of the highchair push the mat into the carpet and stretch it a bit.  This leaves crescent-shaped bumps or indentations on the mat.

The base is magnetic, so don't keep it close to any electonics like TVs or computers. I love it so much that I bought an orange one for my stepson's room. The orange one glows red when the light is on. Then I bought three more as gifts for various friends and family with young children. And today, I went ahead and bought the green one for myself. 

They stay lit for 10 hours so it's great for all the power outages we get here in the winter. I also use it to get ready for bed or to find things in my room at night while my husband is sleeping since he gets up to go to work much earlier than me.

Lamb,"Long Beach, CA United States","I love this mobile so much that I ended up buying one for my 3 month old niece.  They love it too!!  This is one of the best mobiles because of the movements and the colors as well as the fact that you still have a little night light with a music box when you detatch the mobile part.  Not to mention that it plays music for close to 20 minutes.  My 13 month old loves it (and so does my 4 year old).  He is just mesmerized by it when he's tired and amused with it when he wakes up and turns it on after he's done sleeping.  

I was a little reluctant about this mobile when I read some reviews about it being too quiet.  I wanted to set the record straight.  The mobile is quiet...but it's for a baby and you are trying to lull them to sleep so how loud do you want it to be?  I think that the volume is perfect but if you prefer to make it louder or the house is loud you can switch it to a louder volume but we always keep it on the softest and it's just fine.

And I like the Ocean Wonders mobile because of the ceiling projection but the drawback there is that people said you pretty much have to have the room pitch black dark to see those images well.  Since we keep a night light on for our little one, we decided against that one too.  In the end, we chose the Fisher Price Rainforest mobile because it seemed to be the most soothing and we were NOT disappointed.  She tries hard to stay awake and watch the leaves go and colorful animals go round and round.  But there's something about the slow speed of the rotation along with the jungle noise and/or classical music that just makes her drowsy everytime.

It is not supposed to stimulate your baby!  It is to lul them to sleep!  I also like that you can remove the mobile part and leave the the base on just for the classical songs.

I love the infant car seat holder.  This works our really well... I didn't know they had this option when I bought it so it was a bonus for me since I thought I was going to have to take my 7 month old daughter out of her carseat to put in this stoller, but I just put my infant carseat in there.  This stoller is compatable with almost all infant car seats - we have  Graco.  It it by no means at all hard to push... my 4.5 year old loves to sit in the back of the baby... definately worth the $120... I wish I would have gotten this one before the joovy.  I have taken this stoller to the airport and shopping so far and it has made my life easier with a 4.5 year old and an infant.  I am 5'7 and the handle to push is perfect for my height - usually a problem I have with other strollers the handles being lower.   "

This meant I had to squeeze my child in between the seat and the stroller, and adjusting her body and legs was very difficult.  She was very uncomfortable and cried any time I put her in it.  I bought this stroller and we all LOVE it.  Here is why:
1. Easy opening child tray so child goes in and out of stroller easily
2. Large undercarriage basket
3. Parent tray, with 2 cup holders and a closed compartment, big enough for a few keys, money etc.
4. Good head/body room for the standing child

Tynes,"Marietta, GA","My wife and I have 3 children ages 3 and under so we've got baby monitors all over the house.  We've used I think in total 5 differet models from 4 different manufacturers including Fisher-Price, Graco, Summer, and Sony.  We've used both audio/video and audio only.  This Fisher-Price model is by far the best we've used.

- Range.  We have approximately 1500 sqft on the floor where we sleep.  Our bedroom is on the opposite end of the floor as the youngest baby's room.  Other receives either didn't pickup at all or when they did they were full of static and background noise so much so that there was a continual hissing of static that we had to constantly endure.  This receiver can be set at a very low volume so that background noises are almost silent but the baby can still be easily heard.

- Rechargable.  With the other monitor receivers it was a hassle to move from room to room.  You have to unplug the receiver and find somewhere else to plug it in.  One of the other models did offer a battery backup but we didn't use it for fear of going through batteries all the time.  This receiver has a built in rechargable battery.  Unplug it and take it with you.  When you're done plug it back in and it charges and is ready for the next use.

We're very pleased not only with the quality but also with the price.  Amazon's price was nearly $30 less than Babies R Us"

Breiner,"Estherville, IA United States","The features that make it good:  there is a flap on the head end that tucks behind AND under your mattress to keep it in place.  The top portion is molded plastic, with a decent height, which is helpful if you're a toss/turner - you won't roll over onto it.  The lower half is mesh, which one assumes is to allow air circulation, but I think it's mostly that way to allow it to fold, and be portable.  There is a foam wedge at the foot end to prevent baby from ""scootching"" out of it.  HOWEVER, this makes the sleeper short enough to only last maybe 3 months (more or less, depending on the length of the baby).  I've read that other buyers had a ""split mattress,"" but mine was not split, but was one piece.  After being folded, it was obviously bent in the middle, but I solved that by just flipping the mattress over for that use.  I suppose that the split mattress was designed after complaints of the mattress being bent, so not a great change in my opinion.  I also liked the nightlight - just bright enough to let us see the baby, without waking her up fully.

It is sized so that it would best fit in a king size bed (if you have 2 parents in bed), but we managed with a queen.  

After reading other reviews, and thinking about my own use of this sleeper, I've come to a conclusion:  The length may be too short to use it for long, however, once baby outgrows it lengthwise, it's probably time to get him out of your bed, as he is too mobile to be in a sleeper of this design.  So perhaps good planning on The First Years part "

I can understand the remarks about the cup holder and basket being on the small side.  If these particular features are on your ""most important"" list, I might think about buying a full-sized stroller or travel system, not one of the Italian brands.  Europeans just don't understand our fascination with gallon-sized cup holders and enormous storage baskets...just look at their cars and you'll understand.

Raven ""Book junkie""",,"We bought this stroller to take on a recent trip to Europe and it was the perfect travel stroller. I did a lot of research on strollers and I was really leaning towards getting a Maclaren, but when we went and actually looked at all the different strollers this one stood out. It's much lighter than the Maclaren and it has a snack tray, which is incredibly useful if your child is old enough to use a sippy cup and nibble on crackers, etc. (We bought this for our then 1.5 year old.)

We must have gotten lucky, because I've never had any problems with the wheels like some reviewers have mentioned, and I can steer this with one hand easily. The seat reclines nearly all the way down and the basket underneath was useful for carrying extra baby items or small shopping bags. It does take two hands to close, which is little bit annoying. It's also kind of bulky even when it's closed. The sun visor is too small to do much good, so I wound up throwing my baby sling over it at times to help block the sun for my little guy. (It seemed like every travel stroller we saw had this problem though.)

It's very light weight and is easy to carry when it's closed. My husband carried this up and down tube stations all over London (along with a backpack and our five year old at times) and he didn't have any problems. We also traveled to Eastern Europe for a few weeks and this stroller got a serious workout in both the city and the countryside. It held up really well and we're still using it as our second back up stroller. The only bad thing is the sippy cup attachment came off during the flight back and we haven't been able to find a replacement. Also the grown-up cup holder is a complete joke and fell off after only a few uses.

Overall though, I'm really pleased with this stroller and would buy it again."

Now-4mnths- she pushes around on the fish with great joy even making fun bubbles. It is a great first tummy time toy. The pillow velcros on so you can remove it if your little one wants to practice holding themselves up or just for a wash.  As far as the new water everyday thing goes. I was good about that in the beginning believing it might turn green or fog up or something. It turns out nothing horrible will happen if you don't change it very often. Actually the ability to empty it is helpful if you plan on taking it with to say grandma's house. Very easy to roll up and take with unlike our playmat. The little sun could be easier to activate bubble noise. A little hard for the little bitty ones. Toys are still good for crinkling and chewing though."

Now that he's 4 months and able to lift his own head fine he doesn't really need the extra booster pillow, and he didn't start playing with the water bit until 3 months.  Plus the velcro on one of the toy links wouldn't hold.  But the little attached toys are very nice - we made a belt for his infant carrier and put them there where he plays with them all the time.

Now I have a gate in the entry way, so I can go through the gate, close it behind me, and go in and out of the front door without worrying they will get loose.  The other gate is used for the kitchen.  I can just put the dogs in there when I am busy doing something and can't keep an eye on them.
These gates arrived within two days of my order.  Shipping was free through Amazon.  I could not have found a better deal anywhere!  
They were super easy to put together and install.  I had both of them unpackaged, and installed within 15 minutes.  No tools necessary.  And they are very sturdy, and look good, too!

He was screaming in his car seat so I put it on right in the store!!!  I liked it because I could nurse him in it while wearing a nursing top -  much easier than in the Bjorn, and nobody can see what you are doing.  The padded lip on the sling is actually really great, it helps prop the baby's head up, and also keeps them from slipping out, which almost happened with a sling my cousin lent me.  
I am now using it with my second son, and sometimes I can slip the sling off me when he is sleeping and tuck it around him and he stays asleep, although you have to make sure you place it in such a way that the ring doesn't get in the way or the baby doesn't get tangled in the ""tail.""  I don't do this all the time, but it is a nice way to get him to sleep when he's really having a hard time, and because the sling smells like mommy, he feels comfy.
I've taken the sling everywhere, and my older son still likes to be in it, even though he's a tad over the weight limit.  
I didn't give it 5 stars because as really tiny infants my sons did not like this. Now though, we use it a lot around the house when we don't want to fiddle with the Bjorn - a great way to deal with separation anxiety.  If you are really clever, there is a way to wear it so you can have an older child on your back.  My older son likes that a lot!"

Although the pediatrician recommended no walkers at this age, I used my judgement and decided since our home was one level, and I am home all day, I could watch my baby safely while he was in the walker. When the walker arrived, I read the instructions and assembled the walker in 20 minutes. I place him in the walker and used some baby blankets to help prop his trunk muscles so he could sit upright. He didn't cry and this was all new to him. I pushed, pulled him until he told me he was tired. He's now five months and can propel himself backwards and side to side in small steps. He hasn't moved forward too much, but of course that will change. In short, this walker is safe, durable and resonable priced. The colors and rocket shape is a bit funky retro. I did remove two items off the ""control panel"", the two arched movable toys, because it was too much. The nice thing as well as the control panel comes off completely to reveal a tray. The seat also easily detaches and just throw it in the washer/dryer. Rest of the walker can be cleaned by wiping with soap and water. There are three height level adjustments to the walker. And the walker collapes for storage. To summerize, I would definately recommend this walker, for it's durablility, practicality and to increase motor skills, perception for the baby"

I'd recommend this to anyone with children who love to draw or color.

Which is what crayons are wont to do in little hands.

I think Crayola would have been better served making these a bit thicker for tiny yet strong hands. The same way they have those super big crayons for pre-school.

Another thing, you may consider just getting the bath crayons. The board is cute, but Lydia prefers a bigger canvas and only used the board for a few moments before moving onto the great big tub and tile. Don't fool yourself, they're going to color on the tile. (; Wipes away easy enough though! 

If you go to Babies R Us, you will find Baby Einstein crayons for $3.99. A nice replacement with the same sleeves included. Colors include Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Black and Orange.

ETA: The easiest way I've found to clean the tub after a couple of sessions of crayon play it to spray the surfaces with Scrubbing Bubbles, let it sit for a few moments, and wipe away. There is a bit more elbow work required otherwise"

Being an engineer, I took it apart and noticed that the gears are designed to click (or skip a gear) if a child were to grab the frog or the monkey while it is moving. This prevents the gears from being stripped or the motor overheating. However, the tension on this ""gear skipping"" behavior is too sensitive such that after 3 hours of use, the clicking occurs from just the friction of the frogs moving up and down on the bar.

I called customer support about the clicking and they promptly sent a replacement bar. After 2 weeks of using the new bar, it started clicking. Argh! The good thing is that the new bar does it randomly. We're willing to live with the flaw and the annoying clicking from time to time for the Pros listed above.

The other con is questionable. There is much debate about the height of the toys on the bar. Being an ""infant"" bouncer, it is designed such that the child can grab the toys and even pull the rings off the monkey. Our daughter loves it! We do have the Fisher Price ""Kick and Play"" which is designed for slightly older children in that it provides more clearance between the child and the toys ... hence ""Kick and Play.""

The bouncer comes with a one-year warranty. So for a year, I can get replacement bars as the clicking becomes annoying. After replacing enough of them, will their engineers will fix the problem? I hope so.

19 March 2007:
The clicking has returned with the replacement bar and won't go away. I called Fisher Price for a replacement bar. While they really wanted to send a voucher for $48, I pressed to have another toy bar sent as a replacement. At that point, customer service informed me that there is a backlog of replacements on this bar till 30 April 2007. Customer service continues to be very friendly and easy to deal with. We're willing to wait for the new bar ..."

The only negative is that it does not remember your standard settings every time you turn it on.  Each time you turn it on the volume is on low and the sound is the ocean.  Also, if you have a power outage, the battery backup will kick in, however, not before the sound resets to low volume ocean sounds.

Amazon doesn't sell the new model apparently and I don't know what the differences between them are.  I checked the Fisher-Price website and it doesn't say, but they list both models.  I ordered mine from Amazon on March 9, 2007.

The chair was exactly what we were looking for.  Our dining area is fairly small so using our existing dining chair does save space.  The booster chair feels secure as it secures both behind and under the dining chair with buckle straps.  It also has non-skid rubber feet on the bottom of all four corners.  The 3-point to 5-point harness is helpful for keeping the baby in place.  We were using one of those cheapy plastic block booster chairs and our 7-month old kept slouching underneath the tray.  The countoured seat in the Space Saver High Chair helps to prevent that.

The adjustable height was useful for raising the tray to just above our table level so we could slide the whole chair underneath when not in use.  I'm not sure when we'd recline the seat, but I guess it's a nice option to have.

The chair reminds me of a car seat, and as such, keeps our baby in place while feeding.  The one-handed release of the tray and the highly adjustable settings are convenient options.  I don't think I could ask for anything more out of a booster chair.  Perhaps a built-in iPod adapter with speakers built into the tray or something.  Just kidding :"

Tracy,"Clinton, MS","I agree with the other posters -- this pillow's stuffing has not held up like I'd expect from a Boppy.  It's almost as if someone besides Boppy made it and put the Boppy label on it; but the design is exactly what I've come to expect from Boppy: innovative and unbeliveably useful.  I have been using this pillow since I was 6 months pregnant, and my baby is now almost 17 months old.  I just can't give it up.  My husband and I fight over it so much (he loves it, too, calls it the ""comma pillow""), I'm considering getting him his own for Christmas!  The shape provides so much back and bip support, even when you're not pregnant.  I honestly don't think I would have gotten any sleep during my pregnancy if it hadn't been for this pillow, and the little tail (small end of the pillow) can provide amazing support for your lower back when you're nursing on your side (which means I was able to get sleep during those first few months of ""sleepless"" nights, also!)  My pillow came with a washable case, so I toss that in the washer.  The pillow did start to separate after a few months, but I've tried to keep it fluffed regularly; and I think that's helped it stay in one piece instead of separating fully into two sections.  All in all, I highly recommend this pillow; but, as one other poster noted, it's a matter of personal taste -- and body shape -- as to whether it will become your favorite or be deemed a poor investment.  I've definitely gotten my money's worth, and will likely buy another one when this one wear out -- even if I don't have another baby"

  many of the other moms wrote how their kids seemed to love it.   wsh i could say that!  i love it, because i know it is protecting my child from a potentially very harmful fall.  but, he REALLY was freaked out by it the first few nights.  i think it would be nice if it were to go higher up, have a higher arch, thus not making it feel so confining, so much like being caged in.  so he didn't like it at all, but, it has been five or six nights now and he is used to it, and simply checks it out, then rolls over and goes to sleep.  but it did cost us some tears.

Now, we know they are safe and secure and totally happy ""camping"" in their cribs.  We do have traditionally designed cribs, so attachment issues have not been a problem and we are able to lower the moveable side of their cribs with little difficulty.

We have had to do a little needlework on one of the tents as the mesh separated from the edging material attached to the crib.  But it was a one time repair and is holding up well.

We did have to anchor the zipper to one of the velcro straps after each boy learned how to open the zippers on their own.  We initially used a ribbon loop under the tent pole end and later utilized a carabiner clip and the velcro strap for more easy access.

We always bring the tents with us on vacation if we will be using standard cribs.  Love this product and the safety it provides to the boys"

We are not actively training but I wanted to introduce him to it. The first night I got it, he went pee pee and boo boo in it. I screamed and clapped and sang a little song. He really likes it. He even brought it out of the bathroom and took it into the living room to watch The Wiggles while sitting in it. I like the color, and how it fits his size(He's 27lbs and 32 inches tall). He can sit on it and get up all by himself. Its very sturdy, it doesn't wobble or tip over like some do. My son has even held onto one of the sides (while sitting on it) and leaned over to pick up one of his books and the potty didn't tip at all. One reviewer said the splashguard was a little short, but I haven't had a problem. My son tends to look down at himself while he's going, so everything is pointing south anyway. I love that there are only 2 pieces to this chair. Very easy to clean. I had a safety 1st chair with the flip top lid and the detachable splashguard and I absolutely hated this thing. My son would pull off the splashguard and walk around the house with it. He was too concerned with the lid and turning around on the chair to pull the lid up and down instead of concentrating on trying to go potty. With the baby bjorn there are no distractions, no music, no removable pieces(except the bowl)which allows him to focus on going potty.  I just really like this potty chair. I would highly recommend this chair"

Granted, this took a few overheated bottles and a little practice to get it right.  At first, we were pretty p.o.'d that we couldn't get this thing to heat consistently (my wife is a doc and I'm a lawyer so you'd think between the two of us we could heat up four ounces of milk, but nooooo--apparently you need a PhD in nuclear physics to accomplish this).  After about ten tries, I started to get the feel for it, and now, I don't even measure the water- I just dump a bunch in and start counting.  Going by time produces much more consistent results than relying on the water measuring, which if done with exact precision would probably work perfectly.  For me, holding el porko in one arm and manipulating the faucet and water measuring flask is a bit rough, so again, for me, just counting off ten alligators and pulling the bottle works great.  I'd recommed that the company devise a flask that utilizes a sliding mechanism and slot so that you get an exact amount of water each time with excess water spilling-off.  

As a sidenote, we use chilled expressed milk in Avent bottles and I find that: 1. leaving the lid on the bottles makes it easier to remove the four ounce bottles from the steaming warmer; 2. squeezing the nub? (the bulge right below the nipple tip) of the Avent bottle releases pressure built up by heating; 3. swirling the bottle gently after pulling it from the warmer is a good thing; and 4. a once a week cleaning seems to be about all the maintenance this thing needs.

I griped to my mother about the sometimes inconsistent heat, to which she laughed and told me, ""go boil some water, pour it in a cup, drop your bottle in, wait 10 minutes for the bottle to warm up, clean up the mess you made, then complain to me how hard you have it.""  Point well taken.  Thinking about it, you'd need some sort of temperature probe or something to monitor the milk temp itself to really get exact results every time.  Maybe they'll have some doodad like that by the time I have grandkids.

This warmer, Avent bottles, and the hard-to-find Gerber Anti-Gas Relief Simethicone drops have made my life much, much easier (oh yah, and lots of Excederine and coffee too).  The kid is fed, burped, and oh yah baby, sleeping so I am off to night night.  Life is goooood"

There is a little water holder that attaches to the side of the unit to keep the water ready for when you need it.  Just add the water, put in the bottle and wait 2-3 minutes.  The only problem I have with the warmer is that I use water for the bottle that is room tempature so if I leave the bottle in the entire warming time it gets too hot for my baby to drink.  So I just take it out after 1 minute, check it on my wrist and it is usually ready. If you are taking a cold bottle from the refridgerator and warming it, you can leave it for the full warming time of 2 - 3 minutes.  I highly recommend this warmer"

It's all easy to do while holding a baby in one hand too. The only negative I see if I've yet to master how much water to throw in. It works by putting in a small amount of water right into the unit and then it heats up essentially steaming the bottle so it's an even warming process. The problem is most likely me because I never pay attention to how much water I'm putting in to note for the future if it was right or not.

My 19 month old gave it his seal of approval when he refused to get out of it the first time he went for a ride.  If he even sees it, he wants in it!

The main differences between the 2007 and the 2006 are:

1.  Increased seat recline of up to 70 degrees (earlier versions only recline to 45 degrees)

2.  Increased back support on the seat back

3.  Additional padding added to the seat

Quite frankly, these improvements weren't a huge selling point for me.  If my son was an infant, the increased seat recline might matter, but at his age he doesn't want to recline at all.

The sun canopy is the biggest I've ever seen on a stroller.  In the past I've had to put a blanket over the canopy to try and shield the sun from my son's eyes, but this canopy solves that problem.  It is huge!

As for maneuverability, the Revolution far surpasses any other stroller I've tried.  It is a smooth, steady ride.  I typically use the swivel feature, but the stroller is still great with the front wheel in the locked position.

The storage basket is fairly large for a jogger and is sufficient for the typical walk or jog.  I did take this stroller to the mall today and, while it was incredibly easy to maneuver through the mall, the storage basket was not large enough for shopping and storing packages along the way.

It is very easy to fold and is fairly compact when it is folded, but it does not have a latching feature which makes picking it up a bit awkward.  It's not a huge deal to me, though, since I usually leave it open and ready to go in our garage (thank God for 3-car garages!).

I really like the 5 point harness and my son doesn't mind being buckled into the seat.  He seems very comfortable and snuggles right in as soon as I put him in.  The ""cup holders"" inside the seat are nice, but he has a hard time getting his cups into them which tends to frustrate him.  An older child may not have an issue with this, though.

The shock absorbers are really nice and work very well.  We can ""off road"" in it and still have a nice smooth ride.  If I hit an uneven area of pavement or branches/roots on the trail, it is barely noticeable.

Overall I am very happy with this stroller.  And, more importantly, it got my son's seal of approval"

Tapia,"Dallas, Texas","I picked this up at my local BRUs store.  I've had the snack cup only going on 6 yrs now on an umbrella stroller and got this set for my 3rd child's new Combi Savvy EX stroller.  The stroller came with a soft pack accessory holder that angled with the handles of the stroller but I needed more drink holders for my 2 older children and us adults.  It has WORKED PERFECTLY for us and I didn't have any problems installing the clamps - more details on that later. 

The very dark navy set (as pictured) blends well with my black & silver stroller.  This is what the set comes with and what it's for:
1) 2 clips/clamps with large & small crews (used large screws to fit around the oval tubing of my stroller) and an allen wrench.  I think more clips would've been nice so people could use more of the attachments so I'm going to try to find long screws to replace the small screws I used on the clip on my old umbrella stroller. 
2) 3 different sized ""C"" shaped bottle holders (pop bottle in at the neck) Use small size for normal water bottles, medium for Gerber styled baby bottles & wide-mouthed water bottles (i.e. Propel & Gatorade) and large for Avent style baby bottles.  
3) A big cup holder - it was already assembled so we haven't had problems with the arms popping out, as other reviewers have stated.  It can be attached to the clips on 2 sides, one where the cup can swivel (why??? I don't know) or the other where it's stationary.
4) Double-cupped snack cup with connected lids that swivel open.
5) A mesh bag that is small (7 x 9.5 inches) but people - I think this bag is to hold all the attachment parts!
6) 2 large ""S"" hooks and 2 small ""S"" hooks.  They do look flimsy but they work.  Keep in mind, you aren't supposed to load up your stroller with heavy items anyway (so it won't tip over) so don't expect to hang your loaded cooler on it!  We used both large hooks, one with a bag that held my Bjorn baby carrier and the other with a bag of snacks & small pint sized water bottles in it.  I do have the multi-colored ""S"" hooks from another manufacturer - they are very sturdy and do swivel but they will not fit on the tubes of this stroller.  

NOTE: I have not seen large enough hooks for the aluminum oval tubes of these newer strollers. So these will be very useful b/c the basket underneath our stroller does hold a good amount but not enough for a productive day at the mall :-)

Other reviewers have rated this item low for what I think are unwarranted reasons or high expectations of an after-market stroller accessory.  This item will not work on EVERY stroller out there.  Yes, the big cup holder will stick out a bit but at the zoo or mall we haven't had anything fall out.  Put some forethought into placement of the clamps and you won't be frustrated putting them on. 

RE: Installation:  I recommend closing your stroller first and look it over for possible locations of the clamps.  Then when first installing the clamps, test the closing of your stroller before totally tightening the screws.  On our Combi, it goes right above the clamps that you pull that closes the stroller and right under the included accessory pack.  Later when our baby starts eating snacks I can see a possible place for it right next to the seat frame but then the front rail of the stroller does have 2 cup holders on it so I think we'll really end up keeping the 2 clips up top for us.  The location it's at now is angled and yes, your attachments will end up holding your drinks straight.  The attachment pieces have an octagonal shape so when you pop the piece in, it can be straight.  Taking the piece off is easy, you only need to hold the clamp with one hand and pull the piece off with another.  DON'T FORGET to take these attachments off before closing the stroller and throwing it in the trunk of your car b/c the items may pop-off and get lost or they may break.

This set has REALLY WORKED WELL for us and the price is good.  We were set with drinks for the whole family for a full day at theme parks and the zoo! Good luck"

Angst,"DE, USA","I'm a mechanical engineer and after reading the other reviews, I thought I'd have to pull out my tools to make this thing work on our Peg Perego P3 stroller.  In fact, it went on quite easily.  The key is to locate the clamps just below P3 logo on the brace that goes down toward the rear wheels.  This allows the stroller to be folded up without removing the clamp - even if you have the large accessories like the snack tray or cup holder attached.  I did have to slightly angle the cup holder out when the seat was reclined all the way back (because we snap in the car seat currently with our infant).  I could not attach the clamps anywhere else on the stroller though due to the large oval tubing and necessity of folding it up.

I'm impressed with the quality of the unit though.  Do be sure to use the long bolts since the oval-shaped tubing makes it a little difficult to connect the two halves of the clamp.  It would be even better if ""ClicknGo"" included bolts that were 1/4"" longer so you wouldn't have to strain to pull the halves together. "

You do need to test the positions before you tighten the clamps to make sure they won't interfere with closing of the stroller.  We placed one clamp on the side so our daughter could access either her sippy cup or the snack tray depending which we had attached at the time, and the other clamp on one of the stroller handles so we could attach the cup holder or water bottle holder for our use.  We spent a few days at Disney World and had no problems with the attachments falling off or knocking into things.  You do need to remember to remove and store the attachments before folding the stroller so they don't get knocked off and lost.

I do wish it was a little more narrow to maneuver through tight store aisles, and to take up less room in my house, but I have no other complaints. Here's a list of pros and cons...
Pros:
- Rides very, very well. Durable up and down curbs. 
- Large storage area accommodates up to three bags of groceries.
- Toddler is comfortable and naps in stroller.
- Reclines easily and folds pretty easily.
- Two cup holders in back and one in front tray which clicks off on one side to remove child more easily.
- Window in back to view child through shade.
- Adjustable handle is good for tall people (I'm 5'10"" and push it comfortably).  
- Works with Graco car seat for newborns
Cons:
- Quite wide. Sometimes hard to fit through aisles of small neighborhood stores and takes up a lot of space in home and car trunk. 
- Doesn't accommodate newborns without car seat. 
- Shade doesn't fully shield child until he/she is quite tall. Until about one year of age, I draped a light blanket over the shade when necessary. "

Nanas ""Reviewing only what nobody else does""","Brooklyn, NY","I was actually pretty impressed by this potty, and just happened across Amazon to see what the price was here (I had to buy it at a B&M, and wanted to double check to see if I overpaid).

This was for Child #2.  Child #1 had a potty, but was potty trained in the span of a week and never even sat on it (she used training seats instead).  Child #2, well, not so good.

After a few weeks of unsuccessful attempts at the training seat, I decided to get him a potty.  Had I read the reviews here first, I never would have bought this one.  Luckily, the B&M was my first stop and I ended up with two of these potties (one for home, one for grandma).

Pros:
Works as advertised
Easy assembly and cleanup
Decent battery life
Inexpensive

Cons:
The musical fanfare that follows a successful 'drop' isn't foolproof, and will sometimes fail to activate.
Deflection cup in the front is a little awkwardly placed, causing some collision (do I have to elaborate on that one? :)

Summary:
It's under twenty bucks, assembles in minutes, and doesn't eat batteries.  OK, sometimes the music won't work - it's not exactly a high precision laser sensing toilet (if such an animal exists).  It'll still work 90% of the time.  I had bought the expensive potty for Child #1, and trust me - although it cost more than double the price of this unit, there were no appreciable differences between the two.

It's easy to clean, inexpensive, and works as advertised.  I wish more kids items managed to meet these simple requirements"

It is very secure because of the adjusting dial and he can get on the potty all by himself.  No more accidents after a week with this seat!  The high front prevents #1 spillage and the contor shape holds him well.  I wish that I had known about this seat 8 months ago.  I very highly reccomend this seat"

There is nothing else on the market like it...so, we went ahead & purchased it. 

This is an adjustable child's toilet seat that fits onto a regular toilet.  Because toilets come in different sizes/etc. there is a dial(near the handle) which you turn to make the trainer seat fit snug on the toilet.  I have found it is easy to place on the toilet plus it is so easy to remove.  Some other brands of child's toilet seats are very difficult to remove.  The BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer also has an oval shape opening...child's head won't fit through it.  A child might try to wear it as a ""hat"" but it will not go down over their head & around the neck.  

Neither our son or daughter have had any problems using this seat/trainer.  It is easy for them to place on the toilet and remove. Our children do look so much more ""comfortable"" sitting on this Toilet Trainer seat instead of sitting/falling into the toilet when using a regular/adult size toilet seat.  Before purchasing this I also checked out the Toilet Trainer at the BabyBjorn website.  I was impressed with the information there.  I recommend people consider purchasing the Toilet Trainer."

Moss,"SLC, Utah","This exersaucer has many great aspects. There are many toys for entertainment and if your child gets bored with the toys that came with the system, switch-a-roo's can be bought to mix things up. Our daughter has had this since she was 3 months old and at 5 months loves it even more. She loves the frog on the string because she can easily ""mouth"" it. There is learning and music on two of the three electronic toys and volume control on all.
We use the arch solely for floor play at home and away from home because they are difficult to reach when attached to the exersaucer at an earlier age. Not sure how the toddler station will entertain yet; but as an infant, this toy is great. The cost can be expensive, but when you add up the variations, it is well worth the cost. The system does collapse but is still bulky and heavy to move around. The system can be a little time consuming to assemble but aren't our little ones worth it?!
At the same time we bought a stationary bouncer because our daughter loved to bounce when we held her. However, we found that she stays entertained with this exersaucer for longer and seems to enjoy it better as of now. 
I highly recommend this product for a child to learn to entertain themselves (which builds imagination and better attention spans... and gives mom/dad a moment to clean a bottle or two) and is a great tool to interact with your child as you sit on the floor (eye contact and communication reinforces learning with the toys)"

Color samera picture looks like there is some oil on the lens or something - not necessarily grainy, just smudged looking.  I have returned it for a new one to see if the color one I had was defective. I didn't see why the picture quality would differ.  We'll see!  Also, you never get much color so don't' buy it for that.  We didn't care about the color as much as the size/portability of the monitor.  Also, you can easily plug it into the TV if you want the picture on the TV instead of the monitor.  Very cool idea.
But overall we love these monitors. The black and white one is crystal clear, excellent sound, and good reception too.  You do have to move the monitor around sometimes if something else interferes with it but this has been a very minor problem in our house.  Also, if you walk in the monitor and camera path it sometimes gets static. Again, rarely a problem.  And ours sits right near our phones, computers, etc.
We have two monitors and can switch the A and B channels to see each of the kids rooms which is so convenient.  Definitely a ""can't live without it"" item for our family. Although the regular black and white one is good enough if you don't care about portability/counter space.
Also, we have had a great experience with Summer Infant customer service.  After having the black and white monitor for a long time we noticed a low pitched hum and they sent us a replacement very quickly, no problem. "

She wakes very easily and is very active the moment she wakes up.  With the bedrooms on the second floor I am now able to watch her from our first floor using this monitor and know she is safe. This monitor has also been wonderful when traveling to see relatives. I am now able to relax and enjoy our visits with the ability to watch our little darling sleep soundly.

The image is clear if the camera is within 4 or 5 feet and even when we have placed the camera 10 feet or more away, it is grainy but we can still see her tiny little body enough to know she is safe.  The wireless video with night vision definitely met and surpassed my expectations. The other plus to this unit is that you can buy an additional camera and switch between the two cameras using the two channels available on the handheld monitor.  I definitely plan on doing this when we have our second child. The only annoyance I have experienced with this monitor, compared to my regular sony audio monitor, is that I get more interference with this one. 

Overall I would recommend this monitor to anyone who is looking for a video monitor. I was nervous spending this much money without first seeing the quality of the picture, but I am pleased to say it has been worth every penny. Our friends and family are always so amazed by this when we show it to them. My husband and I just love being able to see our precious girl at any time and know she is safe."

I also received a larger more elaborate play gym at the same time.  Because this gym is smaller and more portable I started placing my munchkin in it at 3 weeks to stimulate and entertain her.  The bold black and white designs and primary colors are perfect for a newborn to attempt to focus on and there aren't a ton of hanging toys to overstimulate or startle her.  It folds up easily for carrying around the house or packing in the car for a trip to Grammie's.  You can even throw in a few extra toys when folded (it's like a large purse or carrying bag) and know that they won't fall out on the way.  Now that baby is close to 2 months old and more playful the hanging toys are just the right height for her to bat at and she loves to gaze at herself and coo into the mirror.  Overall I'm pleased with the gym and would reccomend it.  I only gave it 4 stars because at times the overhead bar will tilt this way or that and you have to straighten it a bit to keep it upright
B0008JIMBM:a_few_minor_flaws_but_a_good_swing_overall.:sarah_johnson,B0008JIMBM,Graco Discover and Play Caterpillar Open Top Swing: Baby,baby,,4.0,A few minor flaws but a good swing overall.,"October 19, 2006",Sarah Johnson,,"We picked this swing over others because it's bright and colorful and because of the sound and speed options. We don't find the motor to be noisy at all... in fact the white noise is rather calming for the baby. 

It has taken my son a month or two to get used to it. I think he just noticed the moblie a week ago (he's 2 months) I think as he gets older and can play with the front tray he'll like it much more.

Good points:

*Familiar songs (to other Baby Einstein products)
*Speed settings really are different.
*Seat reclines quite a bit, very comfortable
*front tray has many options such as speech, sound and songs as well as rotation.
*parent friendly and easy to assemble
*not ""graco green"" rather cheerful looking.
*removable tray toy is great for ""tummy time"" or carseat toy.
*cheery, stimulating moblie.
*noise is adjustable.
*good restraint. baby is secure.

Flaws:

*the mobile is too high up for newborns. My son didn't notice it until recently, each time i tried to point it out, he just looked at me instead.
*the plastic tray sticks so tightly that it takes a real hard pull to open it.  It always gives the baby a jolt.
*songs on the front tray are too short I keep having to go up and press it to keep him interested.
*the nature sounds sound more like static than anything else, great idea, just needs to be clearer.

If you don't mind the minor flaws its a great swing for a good price compared to others"
B0008JIMBM:it_helped!!!:keke,B0008JIMBM,Graco Discover and Play Caterpillar Open Top Swing: Baby,baby,4 of 4,4.0,It helped!!!,"April 27, 2006",Keke,California,"We purchased this in desparation because our son has a lot of colic outbursts and we hoped previous reports were correct.  Although it doesn't always work to calm him, it helps 2 out of 5 times which is better than before, and he even falls asleep in it occasionally - something he only previously did in our arms.  So we have had it for 2 months and as long as i put on some of the white noise, in his non-fussy modes, he generally will go to sleep for about 1/2 hour!  

There are 2 things i would change - 
1.  the straps are a pain to work, and with a newborn they aren't really necessary since he doesn't yet move much.  i always put a blanket on the fully reclined seat to soften the feel of the straps on his back (i don't use them yet).  
2. The white pastic bar is a pain to use, it takes a lot to snap it down and unhook it when he is crying, so i just took it off (which took some work after installing it).  now i can grab him easily when he wakes up fussy.
all in all i am very please with it - he loves looking at the hanging animals over his head and the sounds work magic."

My sister gave us an old Graco swing saying it would be an absolute lifesaver. My daughter ended up hating it. I hated it too because it didn't recline enough to support her neck, plus it wasn't very sturdy. So I took her to Babies R Us, where you can try the different swings out. Luckily she was very fussy at the time, even in my arms. She kinda liked the Nature's Touch swing but it was 40$ more and took 4 d batteries for 100 hours of continuous use. Then I saw almost all of them took 4 d batteries for 100 hours. Then I put her in the Baby Einstein swing and I am not kidding, she got quiet and happy. She loved the sound effects and the flashing lights on the tray. It also had a harness seat belt and reclined enough so she could fall asleep without her head bobbling around. I also noticed that It took only 3 d batteries for 200 hours of continuous use! There was another family shopping for baby swings at the time and when they saw how happy she got in the swing they decided to buy it too. 
 That night she honestly slept from around 10pm to 2am. I actually got nervous because she was sleeping so long and woke her up! Oh, I also love how sturdy it is and that it easily folds down to store away or move around. It is the best swing Babies R Us has. Or at least my baby thinks so"

She has been holding her head up since birth and doesn't like laying down anymore. She loved sitting in this and looking at the toys. She's just now realizing her hands are hers to use so the toys on this are perfect. 

Her toes barely touch the floor and so she can't quite jump in it. But at her rate of growth, she will be jumping in a few days! Another reviewer mentioned placing a pillow under the baby's feet and I think I'll try that tonight. With that said, I still wish I bought this sooner. If you are thinking about buying it, don't wait until your baby is older. Buy it sooner and get your monies worth. Even if the baby can't reach the floor, there is great value in the toys.  

So far, so good. Although she is deeply interested in this new toy and trying to figure out what to do in it, I just LOVE it! I can see many hours of her enjoyment, mine watching her and valuable hands free time for me!"

After reading some reviews about injuries and mishaps from jumping into the door frames, we firmly decided against that and researched floor models.

We were between this Jumperoo and another one that has 4 support poles as the base.  The square Jumperoo didn't have nearly as many toys for her to discover and it seemed to take up much more space.  We decided on this Jumperoo because it took up less room and had more toys for only slightly more money.  The investment was worth it for just the first 10 minutes of fun!

When we first put her in, she wasn't quite sure what to make of it and just looked around at the toys grabbing for them.  After she realized (in the first 2 minutes) that she could jump, she did with great joy.  Her face was all smiles and watching her kick her feet out while jumping had us all rolling on the floor hysterically.

The toys she likes best are the ones that spin and she reaches for the parrot and frog that hang.  The tiger that comes up when you push on the button seems pretty useless, as does the color wheel.

The whole thing took us about 10 minutes to put together and another few minutes to wash the toys.  Remember not the submerge the electronic one and to put 3 AA batteries in it.  The box does not include the batteries and you'll need a screwdriver to remove the battery cover.  Also, the large spinning ball has a rainbow sticker along the sides that if you don't dry right away, well, they'll start to wrinkle.  The Jumperoo does fold up for easier carrying/stowing but it's not a smooth transition.  I don't see us doing it that often however.

As I mentioned, the entertainment that the adults got was well worth the cost initially.  And now, our baby girl has a great time bouncing on it while strengthening her legs.  She doesn't seem to like jumping without an audience but maybe she will when she gets a little older.  Don't wait to get this, you won't regret it!"

Within just a few hours of wearing them, the pain decreased.  The shells helped shape my nipples a little better and made it easier for my son to latch with little effort.  After a full day of use, the pain has become almost non-existant.  

I wish I had bought these for my daughter because I might have been able to breastfeed her longer than just 9 months.  These shells have made breastfeeding the wondeful bonding experience it was meant to be.  My son is still a little lazy with the latch, but he is getting better and opening his mouth wider now.

After we strapped the second base into their car, they hardly ever removed it and they relished the opportunities to pick up the baby on the spur of the moment.

They were disappointed when the baby outgrew his Snugride seat and hoped I could find a similar base system for the next size of car seat.  After watching me move his convertible seat back and forth a few times, they've decided to install a second larger seat in their car to avoid the hassle.

The Snugrider was a far more cost & space-effective solution than 2 car seats, and since the base only has to be installed once, people less familiar with the car seat can still safely move the baby in and out of the car repeatedly with greatly lessened risk of error"

Genie ranks #2,"July 19, 2006",new mom,midwest,"I have to disagree about the Genie being the best. It's close, but I like the NEAT better. I've owned several of these things (the Dekor, Champ, Genie and NEAT...why so many? All had issues...read on). Frankly, the Dekor and the Champ both smelled (and ""smell control"" is the reason I want one of these), so those two now serve as garbage pails in other areas of our home. 

The Genie is good at controlling odor, but the top is a pain to use, and the top on my Genie broke after about 2 months, so another one bites the dust. 

As for controlling odor, Genie and NEAT are both the best (they both seal off the bad stuff with different ""sealing-off"" mechanisms that the other models just don't have). And features other reviewers have commented that they like about the Genie are also in the NEAT system:

-put a dirty diaper into a clean bag every time
-plunge the top to contain the smell and section off the mess
- change the bag every few days to a week. (Our 16-month old is in daycare M-F, so we only change our two NEATs once a week. And never a smell. Ever.
-easy to replace the liners. Takes 30 seconds. (No smell when changing it, either).

Plus...
-the handle/plunger on the NEAT is easier to use one-handed than the Genie. Just push and pull. No grappling to get the top off or the bag to grab the diaper and start twisting (with a dirty diaper in one hand and a squirmy baby at the other).
-less plastic is wasted because it pushes straight down. The Genie rotates plastic on plastic which sends more down the chute.  

As you can see, I've dumped a ton of money into this wisdom. But now, I finally have a stink-free environment in my son's room, and so far, nothing on the NEAT has broken (I'm only afraid that because it's an underdog, they're going to discontinue it, and then the refills will be hard to find).  - If that happens, I would try another Genie and hope the lid holds out.  

I rank the Genie #2 out of all of these models"

I chose Larry the Lion and he is a big hit with my 3 1/2 month-old daughter. As she's grown, she's discovered new aspects of Larry which keep her fascinated. His bright colors are quite captivating, and his squeaky tummy usually makes her giggle. She also quite enjoys playing with his ""crinkly"" mane, and now that she's teething, I think she really appreciates chewing on the 2 rings and the purple star that are attached to his paws. Larry is already our ""stand-by"", fail-safe toy when all other toys fail to pique her interest. A thumbs-up from first-time parents"

The intstalation was easy.  At first I thought the gate was broken becuase the latch didn't meet and the upper end stuck out farther than the lower ends.  THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY.  I just want to make that clear.  When you fasten it to the wall, the pressure pushes the top together so that it can latch.

Use of the product was a litlle hard.  The latch requires you to push in two buttons (pinch them between your index and thumb) pull it to the side (left or right depending on a few things) WHILE holding the buttons.  And pushing it forward or towards you.  It sounds hard.  And at first is.  But you'll get the hang of it.  Using 2 hands if you can makes it easier.

Quality of the product is great.  It has withstood a lot.  But keep in mind I have a 5 pund puppy not a 10+ pound child.

One other thing I MUST note is that there is a bar along the bottom that touches the floor.  It is VERY easy to trip over.  And when you do, it hurts.  Don't let this factor alone deter you from buying this gate.  It's a good and relativly inexpensive product and one of the only decent pressure mount gates out there that I could find"

My low back and shoulders we really starting aching. So I decided to see if their was something else out there and I found it! I was torn between the Playtex hip hammock and the Ellaroo. The playtex carrier had so much good feedback that I thought I would love too. I decided to get them both and give them a try. I took the hip hammock back immediately. The material was scratchy and uncomfortable. It felt so synthetic and looked cheap and ugly on. I wanted something I could wear out and still look stylish. When the Ellaroo arrived I was so happy! The fabric is soft and beautiful, it has a really natural feel to it. Now the real test will my son love it too. He did! The second day he actually feel asleep in it. I am able to carry him around for a long time with out feeling crippled afterwards. It is great for shopping as well. It folds up small and goes on in an instant. My son wont deal with sitting in his infant carrier while I grocery shop so I would always end up pushing the cart, holding him with that seat in the way, and minding my 3 year old at the same time. I know you moms can relate. Now he is content riding on my hip and things are a lot smoother for everyone! I highly recommend it!
Just checking back in- my son is one year old now and I am still using the carrier on a daily basis. We both are comfy and happy. Now that he is walking it is great to keep him up when I don't want him crusing and touching everything like at the doctors office. If I was just holding him he would just squirm away and get down. The carrier has also gone through several washings and is holding up just fine. My husband jokes that one day my son will be wearing me in it! haha"

Fitch,"Arlington, TX","We have three children, ages 2 mos to 3 years, and we use this stroller with all three. The seats fold down flat enough that, with use of the seat belt and a head support, our infant does just fine in it. Our 2 year and 3 year old love it because they can sit side by side and talk, share snacks, etc. The only problem we have had with it is that, in 18 mos worth of serious wear and tear (i.e. a dozen plane trips, two vacations, and weekly use at the zoo), the clip that holds it together when folded has gotten warped and so sometimes pops off. The cure? We wrap a luggage strap around it when flying- the rest of the time it is no big deal.

We actually have a double jogging stroller (which cost 3x as much) that, while we loved it for about 2 mos), we haven't used since our second child was 3 mos old. It is big and bulky, and it much more difficult to maneuver. The Jeep double umbrella stroller has been great"

However, I can't give it all five stars either...

For one, this pacifier is really bulky compared to other pacifiers. It almost looks like the nipple you would put on a bottle...it's that bulky.
Second, there is an attatcher that attatches to the pacifier and clips to the baby's cloths so the pacifier doesn't fall on the floor, and that is even more bulkier than the pacifier. So using the two of them your baby is almost consumed with this pacifier. I guess my biggest beef with this pacifier is more cosmitically. It's an ugly pacifier.

Besides it being ugly, it's a pretty good pacifier. I like that my son didn't have a problem with nipple confusion due to using this. From the moment he was born he just had a high need to suck and I just couldn't spare my breast for the whole entire day, so we had to give him a pacifier. He never had a problem using this pacifier then nursing on me. "

I would have to agree that the con is the lack of a handle.

Fletcher ""blessed mom of six""","CA, USA","Ever since our first child was born, I have had trouble breastfeeding.  I produce a copious amount of milk and find it is extremely difficult to teach my tiny newborns to latch on properly.  Therefore, I have relied heavily on this little electric Medela pump for all six of our newborns.

I have read several reviewers say that the pump is sufficient only for occasional pumping sessions, but that has not been my experience.  I actually stopped breastfeeding two of our newborns entirely until they were each about six weeks old and could latch on properly without damaging me.  I used this pump to express milk seven to eight times a day for those six weeks and never had a problem.  The motor kept on going strong until the last baby.

Now, all that said, I will say that I am planning on purchasing a double pump for our seventh, due in ten weeks.  I anticipate the same struggles with breastfeeding him that I have had with all the others and I would like to be able to pump both sides at once.  Pumping then feeding baby from a bottle can consume my entire day, and pumping quickly will be a welcome help. "

I chose this one because I orginally intended to only use it occasionally and I didn't have much money.

Then I developed a Candida (yeast) infection in my nipples that simply would not go away.  Nursing was too painful, but pumping was bearable, so in an effort to continue providing the milk nature helped me make I used this pump.  Sure, the suction wasn't industrial-strength, and I had to do one breast at a time.  However, the pump did the job in almost the same amount of time my son finished his bottles, and I was even able to pump a little extra for longer-term storage.  I was able to use this pump with steady efficiency for two months straight...and my son never once had any formula.

If you are planning on returning to work, I do not recommend you purchase this particular pump.  Go ahead and get yourself the time-saving double pump.  However, if you really are going to use this just occasionally, I would recommend this product"

You just unfold it and it locks into place.  Closing is just as easy with one hand.  The seats recline separately, the front wheele swivle is wonderful.  I can easily push this stroller with one hand.  I have been able to get through all doors, but I will say that there have been a couple places that was a tight squeeze.  There is a good basket under the stroller but there is a bar above it so you can't put anything too big.  I love that it has seat cushions that you can remove and wash.

Watson ""Love, Love, Love Elvis!!!""","Scottsdale, Arizona","We originally wanted a stroller/car seat combo, but we received this as a shower gift. We love it! Our infant Graco Snug Ride carseat actually fits into the stroller (facing whomever is pushing). My husband loves the iPod connection, it works well as best I can tell. The tires are easy to inflate, I was able to figure out the air pump to inflate the tires with out any instructions. I also find that it has a lot of storage capacity for shopping. It is not super easy to steer with one hand as I sometimes have to do when my baby wants out. The stroller is heavy to lift in and out of the trunk and it does not fit in all cars. It can be awkward to lift and stowe ( watch your fingers )and it takes up a lot of space. It does collapse using one hand, but its not as if you could do it while holding your baby or anything else so it might as well be two handed) Also, I find that it is not the best a steering in small isles in stores, it tends to get hung up. However, it will ride over most terrain quietly and with little disturbance to your little one. It has two cup holders in near the handle, but I find that they are usually too small. I read once that they were designed to fit a Starbucks cup--My Avent bottles do not fit well nor do bottles of water. Overall, I would recommend this stroller, its well priced, durable and functional."

It was easy to put together and is very quiet. Since its brand new there hasn't been time for it to get squeeky! My only complaint was that it seemed to lean to the right until I walked with it for about a mile. Then it corrected itself and I think it is nice. The other thing was the left back tire rubbed one time on the break that sits up above when unlocked. But that could have been some uneven ground. I have the Sport model that doesn't come with the MP3 thing I think. I'll just listen to the birds and ambient sounds instead.

Since I needed it ASAP I could not wait for shipping so I called local stores. It wasn't at a few baby stores, which surprised me but I found it at Babies r US. I wanted the original one without side enclosures but could not find it. I guess there's a good reason they changed the design and I trust it was from wise consumers input. Anyway, setting up the tent part was a snap but affixing it to our crib was the challenge. We have a convertbable 4 in 1 crib that has a headboard higher than the drop rail side. This means the front and back vertical poles aren't even which causes a problem when trying to secure the super strong velcro fasteners.It would leave it crooked and possibly able to slide since the corners would not be resting stable as the must be. We found a way to level it, since I was not gonna give up. My hubby mounted an old broomstck behind the backboard even with the front and we got it level, well rested and snug on the crib perimeter.My complaint of taking time and effort is based on good safety so I say it for preparation not to disway your purchasing. The velcro hoops are so tough to pry open and then fasten it worked me out. Also, when inserting the mattress we found it much easier if two people do it so they can get it flat and then drop it into the net rather than trying to sinch down the sides. The enclosure is soo snug that it will make it hard to  adjust if you drop one side down first.  All that to say, my son loves it and was so eager to get back into his crib lastnight. I was a at peace knowing he wont fall trying to climb out again"

The colors are vibrant pastel pinstriped shades of blue, sage green, and tangerine with touches of bright yellow.  I like that brand new from the package, the material is touchable and isn't stiff as a board.
While this is generally listed as 'gender neutral' I think buyers should know there is a *lot* of blue in this set.  While that doesn't matter to us, I know some parents prefer more yellows, greens, oranges, etc... for true gender neutrality.
The embroidered details (Humpty Dumpty, Cow Jumping Over the Moon, etc..) on the quilt, bumper pad, diaper stacker and hamper are just beautiful.  they stand out but are do not take away from the prettiness of the fabric.
The accessories are cute but I think if I had paid full price for the hamper & lamp that I would be less pleased.  The material of the hamper is great, but the wooden structure is very flimsy.  I foresee this getting put inside the closet once baby is crawling or it will easily be pulled over.
The lamp has a story book with Hey Diddle Diddle (cow, spoon, dish) on it - very cute - but up close you notice it was not painted well.  From a slight distance you don't notice it, but it does bug me a little considering the price.
The mobile is cute, but I do not care for the fact that the baby will only see the bottoms of the stars, moon and cow.  Not nearly as exciting as the ones that position the animals/shapes down towards the baby. Would not be my first choice for mobiles (I prefer the geometric symphony one), but since I got this as a package deal I will likely use it.

Overall:  
*the material is nice quality & touchably soft
*the colors & embroidery are beautiful
*the colors do lean a bit more towards a traditional 'boy' room versus a neutral room with light blue as the main color for the bumper pad, the dust ruffle, the hamper and the valance
*hamper, lamp & mobile not as high quality products as the crib set

I would recommend this crib set to friends & family sans hamper, lamp & mobile.  The nursery rhyme theme is classic & well put together here by Lambs & Ivy.
I rated this 5 stars simply for the crib set.  For the price and the amount of items included it is a great deal.  If I were rating the accessories I would not give them more than a 3 for just being average"

We started with gas drops and that nipped the problem in the bud.  Then a couple of weeks ago, feeding time turned into a battle zone.  Screaming, back arching, twisting and writhing, spitting formula while passing gas, burps sending formula up along with air.  We were desperate.

So I ran out and bought these bottles.

The Good:
The moment we switched, the screaming stopped.  HOORAY!  We still get a little screaming if we didn't get the bottle assembled properly and we have leaks, and it seems slightly harder to get burps out of baby, probably because there's less air going in so it takes longer to build up a good solid burp.

The Bad:
These bottles in the 3 pack only come with the stage 2 nipples.  The flow on those was too fast, baby was drowning.  I bought a bunch of stage 1 nipples and WHOA, we went from 125 mL per 30 minutes to 45 mL in an hour.  I tried letting baby build up her sucking strength on these stage 1 nipples for about 3 days, then finally, out of desperation, came here to read reviews and see what others had to say.  I bought the narrow Dr. Brown's Level 1 nipples.  Baby's sucking had evolved by the time I got those home, and unfortunately, she sucks so hard after having used these crummy Playtex stage 1 nipples that she drowns some more when we use the alternative nipples.  This solution would have worked well had I got these nipples the DAY that we noticed how slow the stage 1 Playtex nipples were.  Needless to say, I thoroughly read through the instructions since the screaming had stopped and I was able to process information again.  It recommends that you bring the nipple tip where the hole is closer to where baby's lips come together, meaning, don't allow more than 1/2 the nipple in baby's mouth while she's sucking.  This has worked perfectly and we are now back to 100 mL in 30 minutes. PTL!

The Ugly:
In addition to needing a stage 1.5 nipple desparately (Come ON Playtex, Puuuuhleeeez!), the parts are a bit awkward.  Not like Dr. Brown's, but you have the nipple, the ring, the bottle, the disk, and the vent cap.  Lots of pieces to clean and keep up with, but easy to handle if they keep your kid from screaming at you for hours on end.  Also, you are not supposed to use a bottle warmer on this.  Guess what, I tried it anyway.  Sometimes a bit of formula will leak thereby requiring cleanout of the bottle warmer.  But it isn't too bad and we have been using the bottle warmer anyway, seems to be working out just fine for us.  Take my advice-ASSEMBLE THE BOTTLES WHILE BABY's SLEEPING, YOU CAN'T SLAP THESE THINGS TOGETHER DURING A SCREAMY BABY EMERGENCY OR YOU WILL HAVE A MESS ON YOUR HANDS (and everywhere else).

Bottom line is that our baby is eating again.  So I would recommend, I just take away one star for the bad/ugly portions of my review.

Edit:  These bottles WERE a TEMPORARY answer to our prayers.  However, we have switched to Avent bottles and they have worked great for us for two weeks now.  My advice to parents looking for bottles to solve feeding issues-buy the smallest number possible and give it 5 days.  If it looks good on day one and is the same kind of good by day 5, it's safe to sink more money into it.  But if it isn't going to work out, it will be obvious by day 5 or sooner that you haven't found ""The Answer"""
B00006966I:good_bottle_overall:m._mcqueen,B00006966I,Playtex VentAire Newborn Gift Set: Baby,baby,1 of 1,4.0,Good bottle overall,"December 19, 2006",M. McQueen,Kentucky,"When I registered for my baby shower, I inadvertently registered for the regular Ventaire bottles as well as the Natural Shape bottles (which is what I was wanting), so my review will discuss both types.

NATURAL SHAPE VENTAIRE
For starters, the Natural Shape bottles are good for babies who are breastfeeding, because the milk doesn't flow out when the bottle is tipped over.  The baby really has to suck to get it out, and it has to open its mouth wider due to the size of the nipple.  

Feeding my son with a stage 1 nipple took a REALLY long time.  Approximately 40-45 minutes.  However, I tried a Stage 2 nipple when he was about four months old, and the milk flowed out pretty easily.  So quickly in fact that he got really mad and refused to eat because he was getting choked.  I switched back to Stage 1 nipples, and also began relying heavily on the regular Ventaire bottles.  He is now 5 months old and we have switched to Stage 2 nipples in the Natural Shape bottles, and he is doing well.  He tends to finish a 6-7 oz bottle in about 10 minutes.  These bottles are a lot wider than regular bottles, and he has a harder time trying to grasp and hold these bottles.

REGULAR VENTAIRE 
Now for the regular Ventaire bottles.  I found these bottles to be the better of the two for us.  Although I had initially breastfed, and chose the Natural Shape bottles for that reason, I had to quit breastfeeding at four weeks.  So the issue of having a nipple that wouldn't confuse the baby was no longer a concern for us.

The regular Ventaire bottles had no flow issues, even with Stage 1 nipples.  He finished his bottle faster with this type of bottle and seemed to have no problems with the speed of the flow.  We switched to Stage 2 nipples a couple of weeks ago and the transition was smooth.  I didn't notice him getting choked, and he doesn't have to gulp as quickly as he does with the Stage 2 nipples on the Natural Shape bottles.  These bottles are also slimmer, which makes it easier for him to try and grasp and hold the bottle.

Now for the operation of both types of bottles.  They have a plastic disc that fits into the bottom ring of the bottle, then the bottle screws on, and finally the nipple in its ring screw on top of that.  On the regular Ventaire bottles the disc fits snugly into the bottom.  On the Natural Shape bottles, it has to fit into a little notch, and it is easy to think it's in right only to find out that its not (ie, when the milk starts leaking out).

We heat our bottles in a pan of water on the stove, and the bottom rings have a tendency to hold water.  So if you use this method, you need to tap the bottle sideways on the pan to shake out the water in the ring, and I usually hold a dish towel up to the edge of the ring as well and tip the bottle so that all the hot water comes out.  If you don't, when you tip the bottle to feed your baby the hot water will run down onto your hand (or the baby's hand if s/he can hold the bottle).  This isn't really a reason not to buy the bottles, just something to be aware of.

Finally, some people have wondered if babies swallow less air with this type of bottle.  I have two older children that I used standard bottles with, and I have seen no difference between those and these Playtex bottles.  My son still burps just as much as the next baby.  Occasionally during feeding you can hear some air leaking out, but overall, I really don't think it makes any difference"

It is well-made and sturdy; it didn't tip when my son got on or off. I think the main thing it did was to give my son the confidence to use a potty - his feet stayed securely on the ground and it was stable and didn't slip around. He had no problem getting himself on and off of it and he liked the 'responsibility' of dumping the contents into the big potty (I liked that it was easy for him to do that, and easy for me to clean the  bowl afterward)"

It's comfy, and the fact that the splash guard is a unibody construction with the removable pot is a godsend, in terms of how easy it is for my son to get on and off the chair. Within days of his first success, he was able to use this potty with no help and carry the pot in to me in the next room to show off his latest success! However, we didn't find out how truly great it was until we tried to buy a second potty for upstairs use. We've purchased two others. One had a splash guard so low and poorly designed that my son's ""privates"" landed squarely on top of it every time he sat down. Another had a high splash guard, but it was soft and movable and flopped down underneath my son every time he sat down. He's become very upset each time we try a new terrible potty and I feel awful for putting him through it. No more. We're buying a 2nd Baby Bjorn right now and I'd highly recommend that anyone about to embark on the potty training journey with a boy do the same. Simply the most well-designed potty chair out there"

At first I thought I'd like the IV more, because it seemed as though the fit better around the leg, but I changed my mind quickly.  Not only do these fit just fine, but they are MUCH MORE DURABLE!  After a few washings, the IV began to loose shape and the velcro began to warp (and I cold water wash and line dry).  The BUmmis look just the same as when I got them (except for some stains).  These covers will last me through the next few babies, I'm sure of it!  My only complaint is that once your baby begins to push the weight limit it takes a little practice to get the velcro tabs to stick right.  When my daughter weighed 14lbs. if I didn't fastened the tabs in just the right spot they would come undone, but it didn't take long to figure out and correct.  After comparing these covers with others (my IV and the Bummis original the a friend of mine used), these covers COME OUT ON TOP!

PS - I did wash the covers in cold water at first to make them last longer, but it's best to wash covers in hot water to disinfect.  I started washing the Bummis in hot water (with my diapers) and they're still holding up fine.

We loved our Peg Perego infant seat but she was clearly outgrowing it and uncomfortable. So far she loves this seat and I love the safety profile and color. She enjoys riding in this seat as it has plenty of room and fits her size well. The only 2 flaws that I find I personally dislike is 1. that you do not hear a distict ""click"" when you buckle the 5 point harness. For me this is juat a reassurance that it locked. 2. I dislike the rubber strap covers and may consider cutting them off. They make the straps harder to maneuver. I do like the velcro attachments on the side that allow you to pull the straps apart when you put the baby in. This is a real time and effort saver. Overall we really love the seat. We also purchased the Graco Comfort Sport car seat for our secondary car and it is a good seat overall but not as nice as the Britax. Plus the Britax goes to 65 lbs and the Graco only 40. Britax is definitely worth the money and the better seat for the primary car"

So I return the neutral color and went for the Floral pattern, which I love looking at and so does my husband!  The price was more than I thought the ""next level"" should cost, but well worth it.  I spent a good amount of time at the store looking/feeling the other car seats.  This model is very durable, good feel of the material, and it's going to last!!!  My only disappointment is the velcro tabs, which is a great idea to hold the straps to the side to allow you to place your child in the seat.  The velcro tabs are located about an inch too high. "

Knight ""new mom""","Atlanta, GA","I *LOVE* this product.  It's a far better velcro swaddler than the other brands because it uses bigger patches of velcro.  In comparison to a blanket, this is much easier to use and provides much more durable swaddles.  I'm quite good with a blanket, but by six weeks of age, my son could wriggle out.  On the other hand, at three months, he's never wriggled out of the cotton flannel Swaddleme.

However, even in cold weather, the microfleece is too hot.  Several times I've felt under the blanket to find my son sweaty.  It's even worse when we combine the swaddle with a sling.  On the other hand, the cotton knit (solid colors) blankets are too stretchy - my son quickly converts his knit Swaddleme into a toga, leaving both arms flying free.  The cotton flannel (gingham prints) has less stretch than the other two fabrics, and plenty enough cover to keep a baby warm at indoor temperatures.  It is trickier to find, but worth the search.

The microfleece Swaddleme does, however, make a great non-swaddle blanket on cold days, particularly when the baby is in a front carrier.  The velcro is quite versatile. "

Gehring ""jogging mama""","Kentucky, USA","Shortly after I found out I was pregnant with our 2nd child, I bought a SwaddleMe on a whim.  I knew the benefits of swaddling a newborn from having done so with our 1st child, and the SwaddleMe caught my attention with its design and overall ease of properly swaddling a baby.  At that time, I didn't know exactly how handy this little blanket/wrap would be.

Our baby is now 2Â½ weeks old and this product has become one of the most important baby items we own.  Our daughter was fussy and just couldn't seem to settle down...until I pulled out the SwaddleMe and wrapped her up in it.  The instant change in her personality was unreal.  She's now a happy and content baby and the fussy crying has all but stopped.  The only time she doesn't ""wear"" her SwaddleMe is during diaper and clothing changes and in her carseat - any other time of the day, she's snuggly wrapped up.

Swaddling a baby with a regular blanket can be a bit tricky, but this specially-shaped wrap makes it super easy.  The velcro tabs ensure that the baby can't accidentally loosen the wrap and unswaddle him or herself.

I highly recommend this wonderful blanket/wrap to anyone who is expecting or has a newborn baby"

I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep, then put her in her crib... and she'd flail her arms, wake up and cry, and I had to start all over! What a nightmare! 

Then I figured out that since her arms wake her, it would make sense to wrap her in something so she couldn't move them as much... so I started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets. It worked! It became much easier to get her to sleep. But then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again. 

When she was a little over a month old, somehow I came across SwaddleMe blankets on the Internet and immediately bought it. It worked great! It was so easy to wrap my daughter in it, and it stayed put. My daughter started sleeping so much better! 

I wish I found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me from so many sleepless nights! 

2 years later, my son was born, and thankfully I already knew about those blankets from the start. He goes to sleep great in the SwaddleMe blanket! Out of curiosity, I tried to put him to sleep without this blanket, and his arms wake him right away - exactly the same as my daughter!

Joseph,,"So when my son got to the toddler stage, I was worried about how to keep him warm in his stroller.  We live in the city, so travel by stroller is a way of life.  He loves to be outside, but really dislikes being covered up - you can see the source of needing this product!  Overall, we have found this product to be very good - it is machine washable, it is warm for my son (16 months at the time of purchase), there is room for him to grow into it a bit this winter, it fits our Maclaren Quest stroller nicely, and it is attractive.  The only downsides we have noted are that we wish it had one zipper up the middle, instead of having a zipper up each side.  The reason for this is that we think it would be tougher for our son to get his hands out of the bag this way - he is nothing short of Houdini-like, however, in his ability to get himself out of outwear and protective items like this bag, so it may not matter at all.
The other thing is that is does not attach to the stroller as securely as we would like - it has a tendency to slide down the front, and eventually, usually on a rainy day, the bottom of the bag drags on the ground a bit.  However, going back to the fact that it is washable, this is not a huge complaint either.  This may also be a function of the stroller with which you are trying to use this.
I would recommend this product to anyone with a squirmy toddler who loves being outside as much as my son does"

The peel-off backing is difficult to remove from the tape with out tearing the potty topper.  It takes a bit of time to get off, and if you have a toddler dancing around the bathroom stall, doing the pee-pee dance, you don't have the luxury of a lot of time.  Also, when the 'deed is done', and it's time to remove the potty seat cover, you again need to be very careful, or the tape will tear off the cover, and remain on the toilet seat.  Then you have to pick it off with your fingernail - YUCK!  I think a 'post-it note' kind of stick-in-place would be much better than the double sided tape.  The seat cover doesn't need to stick to the seat forever, just long enough for my toddler to tinkle.  Other than that, this is great.  After my toddler finished, I used it too, and found it to be very comfy.  It was cushiony, and provided a warm layer over a cold toilet seat.  I didn't have to worry about anything leaking through, as it seems to be water-proof.  It was large enough to cover the enitre seat, even those large public toilet seats.  
I will continue to use these, as they do provide the layer of protection I am looking for, but I will need to be extra careful with the tape, until something better comes on the market"

For a couple years we've traveled extensively with our big bulky stroller and while that was great for holding carry-ons, it was a pain to move around.

So this one is fine for what we use it for: quick trips to the park, moving our two year old around the airport and to toss in the back of the car just in case we need it at the mall.

It is a rough ride and kind of squashes him on the sides (he's now 31 pounds) but like I said, it is not our main stroller. I'm 5'5"" and I find the handles to be at an awkward height but my 5'11"" husband thinks it is fine.

I didn't have problems with the handles being too short (I'm 5'7""), but my husband did (6'3""). But overall, the only way it could have been better would to be to have one little cup holder.

The 1st Guidecraft book display help us teach our son to respect his books.  He took such good care of them (like putting them back in the display instead of throwing them on the floor), that we have been able to introduce paperbooks to our 18 month-old, and he doesn't try to tear them apart.

I think this type of book display is more practical for children's books than a traditional bookshelf, due to shapes and sizes"

I put the liner (I use the cheaper soft bags) directly into the bottle.  Then I screw on the collar and pump adaptor.  I pump directly into the bottle then screw off the adaptor and screw on a lid (nipple ring with a plug in it).  Then when the baby sitter goes to feed the baby, she does not have to take off the collar and risk loosing the bag of milk.  She just screws off the top lid and screws on a nipple (using a contrasting color nipple ring with the plug for a lid may help distinguish which part should be unscrewed).  (This also solves that problem of having the milk raised above the readings on the bottle.)  

Only thing I don't understand is why they don't give you more of the plugs that go in the lids.  You wouldn't need the lids if they would just give you the plugs, you could put them in the rings that go with your bottles....

I know this is confusing; you kind of need to be looking at the pieces to understand what I'm talking about.  For occasional bottling, 1 newborn gift set and 1 breastmilk storage kit is more than enough for what I need.  My babies definately take to the nurser nipple easier, so that is how I ended up with this system.  Everything washes in the dishwasher, so clean up is easy"

Whelpley ""queen piddle""","San Diego, CA","I absolutely love this storage system!  After showing it to one of my girlfriends, she replaced everything she used for baby #1 with Playtex and used the Playtex system for baby #2.
It is a very clean and simple system and minimizes the risk of contamination since you do not have to transfer milk from one storage device to another.  It worked perfectly with my Medela Pump in Style; you use the same bag for pumping, storing and feeding.  I have a deep-freeze chest freezer and used this for storage.  I followed the manufacturer's suggestion to double bag for freezing.  I never had any problems.  If you want to see how much your baby is eating, with clean hands, simply lift the bag out of the ring and drop it directly into the bottle shell (the ring is heavy-duty enough that it lifts out easily).  Remember, when you are breastfeeding baby directly from the breast, you don't see how much baby is getting.  Dr. Sears says, ""A baby who is getting a sufficient volume of milk will usually have at least 6-8 wet cloth diapers (4-6 disposable diapers) per day after the initial three days of start-up time.  Enough wet diapers tell you that your baby is safe from dehydration.""  Everyone has different preferences, but I honestly can't see how anyone could be dissapointed with this storage kit.  I only purchased two kits because most of the time, I fed directly from the breast, and eventually, dd wouldn't take a bottle, but for moms who plan to return to work, I would recommend more kits.  I really only used my kits in the beginning when I was pumping a lot because I had so much milk"

Kim,"LA, CA","This seat is a wonderful transition from our daughter's Roundabout.  The reasons why I could not give it 5 stars are the following: poorly designed cup holders; an early tear in the fabric; no secure anchoring.  

Cup holders: we've already spilled juice that's been left in the cup holders.  They are completely useless and should have been better designed.

Fabric: though the material looks resilient, a tear has developed near the lower left corner where her leg sits... I am assuming that this is because the chair is mounted behind the driver's seat, and therefore it gets a lot of traffic as our daughter boards and disembarks the car - nonetheless, we expected something a little more durable.

Anchors: the seat wobbles around and doesn't really hold our daughter in place.  She is often reaching over to pick something up, and the seat nearly topples over.  I am not sure why this wasn't considered in the design.  It makes it easy to remove and install, but I'd rather have something a little more stable"

She was way too tiny for the Jupiter.  The shoulder belt kept sliding off her shoulder and her head wasn't supported when she slept in the car. Another thing i didn't like about the Jupiter was that the padding under her bottom felt too thin and she complained her bottom hurt after long car rides.  Then we tried the Graco.  It is a good seat.  But no head support unless you lay the seat back a ways.  I didn't like the plastic seat belt guides because it hurt my daughter's cheek sleeping on it.  Next we tried the Parkway (Britax).  This booster is by far the best booster on the market in my opinion.  I am a huge Britax fan.  All my kids have been britax babies.  My 3 year old and 4 month old currently sit in the Marathon (britax).  This booster has enough padding to keep the kids comfortable, the head rests keep their heads from flopping.  My daughter likes the way the fabric feels (she is very sensitive).  Even though the Graco booster seat looks like the Parkway, and the Graco is $50 less than the Parkway, I still didn't like the fact that the red seat belt guides (on the Graco) looked like they would hurt to rest my head on. Britax thought of everything with this seat.  I HIGHLY recommend this seat.  Fork over the extra cash and splurge on your child's safety!! You'll be glad you did"

Khan,"Windsor, Ontario.","I initially tried the Avent wide-neck bottles for my newborn and didn't like them. Those bottles leaked, the nipples gave my son suction blisters on his lips, he needed extensive burping, I didn't find the graduations on the bottles to correlate with any other measures at home and my son seemed to have a hard time getting a hang of how to suck against the negative-pressure that builds up in the Avent bottles. Dr Browns bottles solved all these issues. I am extremely happy with them.

You need to get used to washing the small parts but once you have a routine going it's well worth the effort. It takes me under 20 minutes to wash six bottles (I prefer not to use the dishwasher). The small brush which comes in the starter kit and the multi-pack varieties is essential for cleaning and lasts for about 6-8 weeks of regular use. I recommend going straight for the 8oz bottles and buy the 9-pack which is available at other websites. When warming these bottles, if you find the fluid going up into the vent, just loosen the collar, the column of liquid goes back down and tighten again. If breastmilk is stored in these bottles in the fridge, the fat content does tend to stick to the plastic of the vent. You will receive Level-1 nipples with the starter kit/multi-packs, however you may want to graduate to Level-2 at 3-months of age, Level-2 at 6-months of age and the Y-cut nipples for any thick liquids (e.g milk with cereal).  The caps snap on loudly which is the only 'con' I can think of. Use the travel disc to avoid leakage when transporting milk.

My friend's babies with refulx did well on these bottles. My son doesn't have reflux but I can't imagine using any other bottle for him. Highly recommend them and would definitely buy agai"

Once we started him on this bottle, he started eating exactly as he should and has not had a problem since.  We also had to use Nutramigen formula which also helped with gas and reflux, but for us it was the nipple and the ease of use for him.  The downside for us was that they don't fit well in our dishwasher so we hand wash all of them.  When we go out we put dry formula in each bottle and carry bottled water with us.

HELPFUL HINT for all Dr. Brown bottles: When pulling nipple thru the collar, everytime run your finger around the base of the nipple inside the plastic collar to make sure it is fully seated before screwing nipple and collar on to the bottle. Eliminates leaks completely. And do NOT over-tighten collar onto bottle. Again, will prevent leaks. We learned all of these tricks the hard way! :)

For a long time we never used the sensor pad.  We felt we didnt need it.  A few weeks ago our daughter started rolling onto her stomach in the middle of the night unbeknownst to us.  We would turn her only to find her moments later, or even hours later, on her stomach.  We finally let her sleep on her tummy becuase it was obvious that was where she wanted to be.  So the pressure pad is so sensitive that it picks up a 3 month old's breathing.  we have only had a few false alarms but that was becuase she was way over in the corner of the crib.  Hope that helps"

I sleep much better at night knowing that my baby's breathing is being monitored.  The instructions indicate the sensor pad should be placed under the mattress directly under your baby with no bedding or padding in between.  However, I've found the sensor will work even through a mattress, bedding, and a one inch thick sleep positioner.  It's SUPER SENSITIVE which is GREAT!  One thing to keep in mind - You should not have a ceiling fan on at night or have a strong draft in the room (such as an AC vent blowing directly onto your baby's crib).  The unit will pick up air movement in the room.  I highly recommend this product! I would not be resting at night as peacefully as I am without it"

I knew those days were over once my new baby arrives --after all her big sis was 3 before I stepped out of the house without a huge diaper bag. But, at the same time, if my memory serves me well, a bulky bag made hauling around baby and her other gear, etc. on a daily basis even harder.

So I was thrilled when I saw this bag. It came in the mail today (from another merchant) and like another poster, I've been trying it out. It fit a decent amount of the gear I expect to carry in it --a few diapers, change of baby clothing, etc. And so far, it feels very comfortable.

Potty training must be one of the most challenging things to teach a child, every little thing that can make it a bit easier is great!

There's no need to go downstairs and leave the baby crying until you get her bottle ready.  It takes some time using it to get used to the right temperature since the amount of water it states to use in order to heat up the bottle sometimes does not warm the bottle enough or sometimes heats it up too much. I don't go by the amount of water stated to use for each bottle size.  Regardless of the size of the bottle or the amount of milk in it past 4 ozs, I fill the vial with water up to 9-10 and push the button.  From time to time I take the bottle out and check the temp. Once it is the way I want it to be, I just take it out, shake it, and feed the baby, letting the rest of the water evaporate on its own. This way I know I will always have a warm bottle since once it is turned on and shuts off, you have to wait 10 minutes to warm it up again.

But babies react to this little guy like no other toy I've seen.  It was really the first thing that my daughter ever responded to outside of food and people.  She used to fall asleep holding some part of Seizure Dog's anatomy and would wake up playing with one of the various dangly bits.  The high-contrast and bright primary color scheme really draws infants' eyes, especially from generally (and appropriately!) sedate and relaxing nurseries.

We now buy Seizure Dogs for all of our friends with babies.  The next one we get will be the 6th one of these we've purchased, so I'd have to say we highly recommend it"

Scheck,,"While we were preparing for the arrival of our daughter, we were hoping to use these bottles because of the convenience, so when our pediatrician recommended them, the decision was made.  These bottles are wonderful!!!  They don't have to be scrubbed inside with a brush like one-piece bottles.  We just throw them in the dishwasher and they're done.  Our daughter has reflux, and the silicone slow-flow natural latch nipples work well for her.  Our doctor (along with other doctors in the same group) says that these are the best bottles to cut down on gas.   

I would highly recommend buying the premium nursers (featured here) instead of the older original nursers that are slowly being phased out.  (We have some of each.)  The premium lids are a MAJOR improvement-they're easy to pop on and off one-handed, unlike the original lids that you have to pry off with your fingernails.  You can interchange all the parts from both systems (use any holder with any ring with any nipple with any lid), but I think the premiums are much better.  Also, the premiums come with the silicone nipples, but the originals usually don't.  

The liners for these nursers are very inexpensive, especially if you use the coupons that come with the bottles or if you buy the store brand liners (they work just as well).

The only downside to this system is that there isn't much room at the top of the liner to put in a full 4 ounces of water plus powdered formula and shake.  But that problem can happen with any bottle, and I don't think it's a big deal.

GOOD NEWS for those who use these bottles! I just discovered today that you can buy extra rings and lids on www.teebop.com.  (I got the info. from Playtex over the phone.)  I plan to get some extra premium lids to take the place of the few original nurser system lids that I have (and to make up for the ones I will inevitably lose along the way).  "

I have used it since the day I brought my son home from the hospital. It helps a baby to develop focus and tracking skills and increases alertness in the first couple months. It then helps with hand eye coordination. You can dangle an assortment of toys from the arches. We never purchased any of the extra ones you can get because I'd just add some of his other toys with the clip-ons you'd use with a stroller. It is hard to find an educational toy for a newborn that can be interactive as well and last! This fits the bill. You can lie on the floor and talk to them about what they are looking at..sometimes my baby is just happy to have his playtime and can play independantly for about 20-30 minutes. It is portable. We have folded it up and taken it in a suitcase with us 5 times now! Because it is so lightweight and folds up easily it is great for travelling. Then you can set it up in your hotel room or at grandma's house and baby is in a familiar environment to play in which gives you some hands free time and baby some fun as well. It has amazed me how much older children play with it to! Thanksgiving and Christmas at Grandma's all the nieces/nephews from ages 4 to 14 were playing with it on their own and with the baby. Now at 4 months I think my son gets a little bored with it because he likes to be sitting up. Yet he will still play with it for a good 15 minutes ( it may not seem like much but trust me on this, if you want to enjoy a nice cup of coffee/tea in the morning while it is still hot this is a good thing!). I tend to rotate his toys now so I think this will still bring entertainment for up to a year. Toddlers we have had over like to crawl under the arches and past the dangling toys.."

I was a little concerned at first because for such an expensive pump the motor only has a 90 day warranty.  I plan to keep my daughter on breastmilk until she's at least one and wanted a pump that would last.  I tried one of the Avent manual pumps, but I had to be engorged before I would get a few ounces out of one side (nothing out of the other).  The Medela pump is so much easier and does all the work for you.  The pump has held up so far and I'm really happy with it.  I bought extra shields and bottles to pack with me to take to work, and keep the rest at home.  The only downside I saw to these bottles is that they are made to fit only with Medela products.

Since my son was premature I had to pump exclusively in the beginning, and I can say without reservation that this pump works just as well, and quickly, as the hospital pump.  It empties my breasts in 10 minutes, it's easy, and it travels well.  Also with certain bras (not the Medela bras, as they seem to require some type of adapter) you can pump hands free by simply hooking/securing the nursing bra cups over the breast pump cups.
One last comment I will make which speaks to quality, is that I ordered extra membranes and tubing to have available ""just in case,""  but have yet to need them as the original ones are still operational.
I can - and DO - recommend this pump to all nursing moms, and if you think this one is expensive, consider two things:  1. the value of your time and convenience, and 2. the total cost after you end up replacing the cheaper one when you find that it doesn't really meet your expectations or breaks down"

I'm so glad I did.  The Avent doesn't have a battery pack so I don't know how you'd use it on a trip unless you don't mind standing in the middle of an airport bathroom pumping.  I, myself, prefer the privacy of a stall.
Also, no one can tell its a breast pump.  The backpack is very stylish and I was able to fit additional items in it so that I could use it as my only carry-on.  The design is very innovative which you learn the more you use.

We tried Playtex Drop-Ins and were frustrated about 6 weeks in that feedings were taking an hour with the Slow nipples.  The Fast nipples drenched our son in formula.  We moved to Avent with a Stage 2 nipple and found ourselves in the 50% of people who can't get them shut properly.  Loved the nipple shape and speed, couldn't deal with the leaking.  We tried Playtex Ventaire.  Although this bottle claims to not let air in through the nipple, we apparently couldn't get these closed correctly either.  Air entered through the nipple at every feeding and caused gas and spit-up problems.  We eventually made our way back to the Drop-Ins, our son now old enough to handle the Fast nipple, we like these the best.  I still feel reviews are beneficial, but know that your kid will let you know if he or she needs a change.  Find what works for you and go with it.  I give the Drop-Ins 4 stars.  If Playtex would put out a Medium flow nipple, it would be 5"

She originally used the nurser bottles for supplementation while I was breastfeeding(low supply).  They told me to pump so I got cheap regular 4 oz baby bottles to pump into so she could drink directly out of.  She started having all kinds of stomach upset.  We then tried the Dr. Browns bottles.  They were good but she had trouble with the nipple.  We switched to the wide neck Dr. Brown bottles, which she did better with, but still didn't like the nipple.  Finally I got back out the playtex nursers.  Upset stomach problem got better.  She still has reflux, I think always will, but the gas is only occasional now.  Don't waste your time or money with other bottles.  Easier to clean too.  

You can't microwave these liners, but what I do is mix up a days worth of formula in a pitcher that I keep in the fridge and pour into the liner just before ready to feed,  I then put the liner with the formula in a glass of hot tap water.  It only takes a minute or two to warm up.  Then drop the liner in the bottle and you're ready to feed.

My favorite nurser bottles are ez feed with the slider to get the  air out.  They are sometimes hard to find but are really easy to use.  One comes in the newborn set or you can purchase them individually at BabiesRUs or Publix Grocery store.

If there were more than 5 stars these bottles would get a higher rating.  Can't say enough good things about them.  Also easy to travel with"

He had no problems going from my nipple to these and I liked that you could get all the air out of the bottle. Now that my son is on formula I do find it difficult to prepare it in these bottles. It is almost easier to put it in a seperate cup and mix the water and formula. It can be done it the bottle but it is a little difficult to mix it well. I have now mastered how to put the formula in and how long to shake it but it took some practice to get it right without the formula clumping a lot. 

Warming the bottles is also a problem since you cannot microwave the liners (or so it says) my mother did it once without realizing you aren't supposed to and nothing bad happened but since it advises against it, I wouldn't recommended trying it out. Now that my son doesn't really care for warm milk it isn't an issue anymore anyway. 

I still love these bottles and the fact that if I have enough nipples to change out, I don't have to worry about having a ""clean"" bottle on hand since I can just drop in a new liner. I currently have about 6 extra nipples in case this happens but it hasn't yet but it is nice to know that the option is there for us."

Playtex bottles came back into our home right away, and never had another problem. 
I just couldn't believe that they worked so wonderful. They are so much easier to wash, being the pre-sterilized liners just pop right in, and the larger nipple looks so much more comfortable than those tiny nipples that some bottles have.
My sister in law had her first baby in November, and I swore to her that they worked like a charm. I bought her tons for her baby shower, and she started on them, mixed with the breast, and was also amazed that they worked miracles!

I'm fine now that my son drinks regular milk, but when I had to mix formula it was hard. You can actually only mix 6 oz. of formula in the 8 oz. bottles.

For safety reasons, we never let go of him while sitting there.  When he can sit up on his own, we will sit the potty on the floor.  Eventually he will out grow it.  We also purchased the BabyBjorn Potty Trainer, eventually he'll use that next. In the meantime the next older child is able to use it.  

I like that this potty is all in 1 piece.  So easy to clean (no crevises to worry about).  We dump the contents into the toilet.  Add a little water, to the potty, from the sink (the potty easily fits into our bathroom sink to catch the rinse water) & dump rinse water into toilet.  

The size is nice for storing...it won't take up a lot of room.  The size is nice because (eventually when he is older) he'll be able to get on & off it easily himself.

I would have prefered this item in white instead of blue...but at the time of ordering the color blue was the best option  (After an additional item was purchased with my order, I was also able to qualify for free shipping through Amazon).  The colors available would not be the fault of the manufacturer but who I purchased it from.

I was unable to find this at any of the stores in my local area.  We would have had to drive 50 minutes or more away from our home to purchase it at a certain baby store.  Then we would have also paid sales tax & our costs to drive there.  I was pleased with this purchase through Amazon"

This one stood out for value, simplicity, safety, and convenience.  At first, I considerd a convertible booster seat that also has the latch system along with 5 point seatbelts, but decided against it because my son at his age and weight (3.3 yrs, 35 lbs) does not need all these extra features in an extra bulky be-all car seat.  

The latch and 5 point features are intended more for a recent 3 year old, while a toddler from 3.5 years to 10 won't need it, so why bother with all this extra stuff?  You don't need the added bulk and complexity for features that will only be used for .5 more years.  

The B510 premier is the top of the line and latest from Compass, which has more durable fabric, wider side supports, and a carry bag.  My son loved it at first sight, and it works great.  There is no neck support though, so you may need to buy one of these separately for long road trips.  My son was literally propping his head up with his arm on the arm rest when he passed out in the car.  The price of the B510 was $[...] with free shipping, and given the free carry bag which has a retail value of $[...], it makes this booster seat about $[...], which is the price of the older B500 model.

The only thing I have had to get over is that booster seats in general are not secured onto the car seat with a latch, but instead, rely on the seat belt to keep my son and the seat in place.  When driving around without the kids, seats like this need to be secured even if a child is not sitting in it.  The base of this seat doesn't look like it'll rip into my car's leather seat, and the headrest adjusts vertically easily.  I will need to buy a seat protector anyway though, since my son uses the car's seat as a step stool to get into this booster seat.  Also, you will need to train your kids when they can unbuckle the seat belt because it's easily reachable.

The only shocking thing to me was that this seat comes with an expiration date, and is not recommended for use after 7 years from date of manufacture.  Therefore, it's not meant to be kept forever and used as a hand me down for siblings"

My baby was getting uncomfortable being swaddled at about three months, so we decided to make the switch to sleep sacks. We were worried that with her arms free that she might have a hard time falling and/or staying asleep. This was true at first so we started by only putting her in these during the daytime - in a light cotton one. After about a week she was not waking early from her naps anymore and after two weeks we tried her in it at night - and she slept straight through the night (as she did when she was swaddled). So the transition was painless and she seemed a much happier baby to be able to reach her hands and move her arms.

While I didn't notice shrinkage I did notice that the zipper does bunch up a bit, but this hasn't been a problem. Sometimes my daughter sucks on it if it gets close to her mouth, but she has to reach for it - it doesn't cover her face at all or trap air that she could rebreathe. 

I didn't like that these don't have sleeves so I tried Carter's sleep sacks and found the sleeves to be too short and hard to get on my daughter. Those sacks only come in one size which my daughter has already outgrown at four months (14 lbs, 24 inches). She has also outgrown the small size sleep sack, but the medium size fits her perfectly with some room to grow.

I didn't want to use fleece at first since it is polyester. I wanted to use cotton. But we've found that she sleeps longer and seems to prefer he heavier fabric of the fleece one.

Also, we only bought these in blue even though we have a girl because the color is calming to our easily overstimulated baby. 

We've washed these many times and they look just as good and hold together just as well as they did originally. 

We've also found you can put your baby into the next larger size without it being so big that they can get their arms out or that it bunches up around their face. So after everything we've tried we've loved these sleep sacks from day one"

You have to open up the parent receivers and plug in the battery pack before usage, then Charge the system for 16 hours. DO NOT TURN SYSTEM ON WHILE CHARGING FOR THIS FIRST TIME!!! 

I did a lot of research on monitors and found this one to have pretty good feedback on several parents' websites. With most items, there are pros and cons... see below:

Pros:
-You will not pick-up any feedback from the neighbors. This is a significant improvement from monitors in the past. ABSOLUTLY NO INTERFERENCE! 
-Great reception. You will have no problems picking up your child with this. I can take it outside and work in the yard, with confidence that I will know when my baby needs me.
-Interchangeable AC power cords make it easy to move the system around to different rooms in the house. 
-Lightweight and compact system. 

Cons:
-The biggest issue is battery life. HORRIBLE BATTERY LIFE, TYPICALLY ONLY 3-4 HOURS at a time! The battery drain on this system is almost a deal breaker in my husband's opinion. This system comes with the options of 1 or 2 docking stations, I HIGHLY RECOMMED the one with two stations because the system is constantly running low on batteries and and can recharge while the parents portion is on the dock. Or the second receiver can be used while the other is charging on the dock.     
-With any power interruption the child's unit shuts off. The parents unit beeps and flashes red to inform you of the issue, but it can be irritating at 2:00 A.M. to have to get up to turn it back on. Graco really needs to find a way to have the system stay on at all times that it is plugged in. 
-Belt clip does not work well with normal amount of movement. The system is better left unattached to belt, unless you want to be constantly picking it up from the ground.
-A bit expensive.

A little of both... Pros/Cons: 

-Sound: Pro: Great sound, very clear. In fact I can often hear dogs barking outside with this monitor.  Con: Picks up on every little sound because it is so sensitive. For the light sleepers, on the softest level still can be very loud. 
-Loud, every 5 seconds, parents warning: Pro: Beeping will let you know that system is not functioning correctly so you can fix the system. This was nice for us one day when the baby's system had fallen and came unplugged. If the system had not beeped, we would not have known. Con: Annoying beeping while searching for signal... a startling fact in the middle of the night. 

*Overall the system does what it should, but there a few area's that could be improved. I gave it 3 1/2 stars but rounded it up.*"

It has rubber wheels a cup holder and few other changes.  I like this stroller but I am not thrilled with the quality.  The wheels don't look all that sturdy and the stroller has some play as you turn corners. Since this is our third double stroller (2 used ones before) I think this is the way double strollers are so they don't weigh a ton or cost a fortune.  For the price, this is definetly the best double stroller out there.  I love the hinged front tray so you can easily get a toddler out.  My [...] son loves the sit n stand options and it collapses very easily.  Putting the back seat on and taking it off takes a little time but not too difficult.  The second sunshade is also a great option during the summer.  This stroller is going to be especially wonderful at the zoo and the mall. "

Thank goodness we had the opportunity to try one out before we bought it!   With the Joovy, if you have an infant carrier in the front seat, there is no room at all for the older child to sit on the jump seat.  Also, for some strange reason, the jump seat slides back and forth which seems very unsafe.  So if you have an infant in a carrier and your older child wants to sit, the older child is out of luck.  What's the point of that?

With this stroller, the older child has 3 options - sit in the back seat, sit on the jump seat or stand on the platform.  The back seat can be removed fairly easily and stored in the basket underneath and my little girl (who is tall for her age) has plenty of room.  She sometimes dangles her feet over the foot rest but this is not an issue.  Our infant carrier easily slides into the front seat and is secured with a belt. 

This stroller opens and closes easily and is very easy to control as it steers beautifully - it's not nearly as long as I thought it would be but both children have plenty of room. Since it has the footprint of a single stroller, it fits through doors and entranceways with no problem. It is a little heavy when folded but I don't think I would find a stroller with these features that's not.  The basket is nearly impossible to get to but I can live with it.  Overall, I'm thrilled with this purchase and every single time I use it, someone stops me to ask about it.  One woman even said, ""That's the most practical double stroller I've ever seen.""  I have to agree"

The only problem (one I see with many crib toys right now) is that it doesn't fit my crib. It has 3 ties that are meant to be attached to the spindles of a crib. The problem is most cribs now (such as mine) have solid ends, and you can't tie anything to them. This toy is meant to be used at the end of a crib, and it simply won't fit. If you have a crib that has slats or spindles on the ends then you will be fine. I don't, so the only way for me to use this toy is to hold it while my baby kicks at it.Fun for him, but not for me."

It was a bit tricky getting it installed in the car (I recommend reading the instructions, and having an extra set of hands to help you install it) but all carseats can be a bit tricky.  

My 7 month old son loves this carseat because it sits higher up than his first seat and he can see outside (this makes our road trips MUCH more pleasant).  

There are lots of places for you to adjust the straps, buckle, and headrest so you can really make the seat fit your baby.  I am not sure how well it would work for a newborn because it doesn't recline as far as carseats that are only rear-facing, and it might make it harder for your little one to take naps and keep his head in a comfortable position. (Plus, it is SO nice to have a carseat with a detachable base for a brand new baby so you don't have to wake them up when they are sleeping).  But if you only want one carseat, I am sure a neck support pillow in the carseat would work great for newborns.

My favorite feature of this carseat is that I won't have to keep buying more carseats (and then find a place to store the old ones) until my son is old enough to ride without one"

I bought them on a whim and boy was a glad. They help get my milk started because they apply a light pressure which also helps extent the nipple. They keep things (such as a bra) from rubbing against very very sore nipples. Another great feature is the air vents at the top of the cups. They are there to get air to nipple, (you don't want them getting dried out, that just makes the pain of feeding much worse). Determined breastfeeding mom's these are fantastic until your milk supply comes in at a steady pace.

They do not look flattering under a TIGHT fitting shirt (loose is always best anyways) but what does when you are breastfeeding for the first few months as things are adjusting. I felt that they looked better that two huge wet spots from leakage"

It helped relieve soreness while breast is in bra. It keeps the sore nipple suspended in midair and off of rubbing on your bra.  It also helps the nipple stick out a little, which I found made attachment (of baby's mouth to nipple)easier as a first time breast-feeder.  You do need to check the shield now and then to dump out any milk (or some may save it). The only way I see a product could improve in that area, would be to have a bottle size attachment to your boob and whom of us would really want to walk around with that? 
  There are holes in the top of the shield to allow air circulation. For me esp. at night I would put a nursing pad over the holes so that it would help soak up any leakage. But by FAR this product is worth it.
  I'm due soon with baby #2 and am back to buy more. I gave mine to a mom friend who was ready to give up breastfeeding her very hungry son who ate all the time and her breasts were unbearably sore. She swears these shields are the reason she didn't have to give up and is extremely grateful.

Post-pregnancy they helped relieve engorgement because they exert a small amount of pressure on the areola.  This helped my baby latch on better b/c the breast wasn't soooo full. (I have a lot of milk).  The shells catch milk really well, and if they are sterile you can even save the milk.  

The other great thing about these breastshells is that they prevent sore nipples from rubbing on your bra.  I'd put a little lansinoh on my nipples, then the breastshells, then the bra.  Just felt better.  Only precaution: Make sure you put them on with the holes on the top or else you will be soaked, and they really can't be worn outside your home. They are obvious and unattractive"

The good news is if you use breast shells when you need them for the above mentioned maladies- you won't have to use them for long because you will heal after just a few days even if you wear them part time. They come with little curved white sponges that you just drop in the bottom of the shell.  These sponges absorb the milk that leaks so that you don't have to worry about it comming out of the vent holes at the top when you bend over. I just would rinse them with soap and water to clean and let air dry I think each breast shell set come with four sponges and you can buy more if you need them but 4 was enough for me. NOTE: don't use them to collect milk to give to your baby as one reviewer suggested.  The milk collected in a breast shell is to be discarded as it states in the package instructions.

Our street is full of parents with babies and on Sundays the street looks like a stroller racing track. That was great for me and my wife. We were able to see and test many strollers as they all seem to be on our street and in the area. I was lucky to push some other brands that are more expensive and I must say this stroller just felt better then the other strollers we tested. This stroller is fully loaded with all the features a parent and child could ask for. I especially like the individual lower recline feature. The stroller rolls with such ease and the rain cover being included is a great idea as they cost around [...] which takes the base price up on many other strollers. Our little guy's both a year old now (they are twins) have a great time in this stroller and seem to be very comfortable. I was thinking of purchasing a model with front swivel wheels but I just did not like the way the swivel wheel felt. I tested three different brands. The one I liked sold for more then [...] and compared to this stroller I just could not justify spending that kind of money. The other two front swivel wheeled strollers that I tested had a rattle feel to the front wheel area which I was so surprised about considering they both sold for more then [...]. I am not sure if that was because they were 12 inch wheels or if it was the designs. This stroller is one of those purchases I am very pleased about and it has held up perfectly for us over the last year

The sound quality is good at low volumes, which are appropriate for a crib at bed or naptime, but quality deteriorates quickly once you raise it at all.  So, if you are planning on using this for yourself, think again - but that's not what it's designed for.  I do agree that the no-A/C adapter option stinks, but having caught our baby holding on to the IPod charging cord when the IPod was in this device, I realize that having an A/C adapter would just be a hazard - rechargeable batteries would be a great addition - that's the only reason I'm giving it four stars.  Our baby LOVES to look at the lights.  The 15 minute timer is great too, as that's all he really needs.  I'd buy it again, and plan on getting it for friends with new babies"
B000GB0O0O:ilove_the_icrib!:e.t.,B000GB0O0O,Munchkin iCrib Sound System: Baby,baby,2 of 2,5.0,iLove the iCrib!,"January 18, 2007",E.T.,"Fremont, CA United States","After throwing my First Years crib CD player literally in the trash can (don't get me started on what a complete hunk of junk that thing was), I was on a search to replace it. That is when I came across the iCrib. You really can't beat the price - I'm guessing it is reasonable since most of the controlling is done from the iPod itself. Granted I have only had it a few days, I cannot rave enough about it! It mounted perfectly on the crib and I think the sound is fantastic (I have only tried classical and not music with lyrics so I cannot comment on that sound quality). 

I inherited my husband's older iPod Shuffle after I gave him a Nano for X-mas. I searched and searched online but could not figure out whether the iPod Shuffle would work with it. Muchkin's customer service verified that it would because it came with a few adapters to accomodate different MP3 players. Now, I don't really think they made one to specifically fit the Shuffle, but it did fit well enough in the ""small"" adapter they included so I was happy (see the picture I posted of the Shuffle in the iCrib). The iCrib itself has 3 modes - light only (iPod is off), light and iPod, or just iPod. You can also have it play for 15, 30 or 60 minutes before it shuts itself off. The light is actually what I would consider a ""light show"" with the light slowly changing colors which I think is rather calming as does my baby (or at least it seems). 

The only things I would change about the iCrib is that I would really like it to have the option of playing longer than 60 min. I would also be happier if it had the option of providing a steady, soft light to serve as a constant night light (no ""light show"") to guide me during the middle of the night feedings. Otherwise, I am thrilled with the iCrib"

She was enchanted by the nightlight display and soothed by the music. Bella is easy to please, Mama is a harder nut to crack, a product has to meet several criteria to be deemed developmentally appropriate, or at the very least not harmful to her children or those of her readers.

Cost is important, with all the available products on the market for babies and children you want to get the most for your dollar.[...]

Quality and safety are essential, not only do you get a system with superb sound; Munchkin has added a volume control device to the unit to protect baby's delicate hearing from undue noise levels. I love this feature, because many baby products and toys have been found to be so loud they reach levels high enough to cause permanent hearing damage. Bravo to Munchkin for the added protective feature. 

 Extras are always nice when spending your hard earned dollar, this unit offers a nightlight feature, a delicate display of changing hues bright enough that mom or dad can check baby in the crib, soft enough to encourage sleep. The iCrib can be used with or without the nightlight. The iCrib also has an auto shut off allowing for 15, 30 and 60 minutes of play. 

Ease of use is important when you are running a busy household. Set up and installation is simple, and if it easy for me, anyone can do it. You pop your MP3 player into the back of the iCrib, then hang it on the crib railing with the adjustable Velcro straps found on the back of the sound system. The unit can also be used for travel or enjoying in another room as it has the ability to stand on its own.

Munchkin's iCrib was found by Bella and me to be an excellent product. It exceeds our expectations for cost effectiveness, quality, features, and ease of use. The recommended age for the iCrib is 0 and up, making it a wonderful gift either for the holidays or a baby shower."

It looks complicated to put on, but with  a few practice runs you will soon become a pro. I just started carrying him facing out and he is really enjoying it. This carrier is a great investment since it works for all ages (newborn - toddler) and there are so many different ways to wrap it. There is even a wrap for nursing, and one for carrying twins!

What we like about it:
- The Moby wrap was able to be used the day we brought our preemie baby home from the hospital. 
- The Moby wrap swaddles your baby snuggly to you.  If your baby likes swaddling as much as our does, this is the baby carrier for you.
- It spreads the weight out evenly across your back and shoulders and feels much better for longer periods of time (in comparison to our Baby Bjorn).   
- There are a variety of ways to wear your baby with this carrier.  We have used it 4 different ways so far.  Being able to pull the cloth completely over her so she can sleep soundly is a plus.  The instructions are easy to follow and while it looks difficult to put on, it really is quite simple after you've practiced it 3 or 4 times.
- The Moby wrap is easy to clean with being machine washable and dryable and there are no parts that can be broken or lost.

What we don't like about the Moby wrap:
- If you plan on wearing your baby to go grocery shopping or other things out in public, you need to put it on before you leave the house.  It can be difficult to put on in the car or in places where you do not feel comfortable with the wrap touching the floor (parking lot, public floor, etc.).  This is not a big deal, but important to remember before you run out the door.  During the cooler months, I put the Moby on, then my coat.

Bottom-line:  The Moby wrap was an excellent purchase.  Putting our daughter in it and walking around or bouncing on an exercise ball was one of the few ways to calm her during the height of her colic.  Our daughter is now 5-months old and still enjoys the Moby.  We expect to continue to use our Moby wrap for many more months"

You dont have to worry about the nipple confusion etc that you might have with a shield, and previous review is right, most of the time I would easily forget they were there and would have to check to make sure.

There is no way I'd be able to maneuver the tandem stroller on the busy city streets.

Then I tried this Aria Twin Side-By-Side stroller, and it felt so much better then the tandem - it was so light and easy to maneuver.  So I purchased it, and I really like it.

It says that the stroller is from 6-month-old and up, but I successfully use it with a newborn - the seat reclines almost fully, and the newborn lays in it and sleeps.

This stroller fits through all standard doors and most supermarket isles. The basket is large and fits a lot of stuff. Walking in the city with my 2-year-old and newborn is pretty easy with this stroller.

Especially as a mom of toddler and infant.  It handles like a dream all the bells and whistles are fabulous.  Folds like a piece of cake.  Which I can't say about my perego.  The basket drops down so you can access it without changing the rear seat position.  My 3yr old thinks it is the coolest thing ever and she loves the fact that her baby sister is right behind her.  Yes it is a little heavy, but I am a small woman and can manage just fine.  After all my oldest weighs 28lbs.  It is a little longer in person than in the photos - (no big deal)  We all went for our first family stroll after dinner last night it was amazing.  Handles fantastically over bumpy sidewalks - no need to prop up the srtoller to get over a bump.  So STURDY - feel like both my girls are snug and safe.  Love that the five point harness is attached to the seat, unlike the perego.  Really if you have to children (particularly a baby and toddler) this is the way to go!!"

Turner ""goodyearchic""","Buckeye,AZ","I owned the Quattro Tour single stroller, and was so excited when the Duo version came out.  I ordered it without ever seeing it, and it has definitely lived up to my high expectations.  Simply stated, this is a heavy duty deluxe version of a Duo Glider - worth the extra money if you can afford it.

The seats are large enough for growing children - I have a one yr old and a two yr old, and I foresee they will both fit in the stroller for a couple of years.  I ""test drove"" all other double strollers at Babies R Us and Baby Depot, and they all seem to have low seat backs, which won't give any head support if the child falls asleep.

The stroller itself is heavy, so if you have to lug it around or upstairs, keep this in mind.  I keep mine in the back of my truck, so just getting it in and out is no big deal.

I read other reports stating it is hard to steer, and I have had no problems with steering at all.  One thing I can say, is if you are a tall person, this stroller is awesome because of it's higher handle grips.  I am 5'9"", and my husband is 6'4"" and we both use it with ease.

The underseat basket is large, and there is an additional ""cubby"" under the front seat great for extra storage.  Parent cupholders and child trays/cups are designed well.  Fabric is high quality.

The only minor thing I am annoyed with is the low quality seat restraints (""Seat belts"").  My single Quattro Tour and DuoGlider both had high quality padded seat belts with much better buckles.  This one has very low quality nylon straps and marginally acceptable buckles.  

(I also received my box in very poor shape - open & crushed on one side. I only noticed scratches to the stroller, so didn't feel it was worth going through a return process for cosmetic issues.  What is up with the shipping???) 

***ULTIMATELY*** After hours of ""test drives"" and quite a bit of research, I would recommend this over all other equal and higher dollar strollers.  It is overall very high quality, and for those worried about style, it is a very sharp looking stroller in person"

I saved money by buying them at thrift stores - about half of them I bought still in the boxes and the other half barely used. I ended up switching out the older nipple design (square top) with the newer nipples because I liked the design better. It seemed to me that the newer design is more correct for suckling. I also bought a lot of new boxes of liners at the thrift store too! My daughter suffered from mild gas, but nothing major. I liked these bottles because of the liner idea and my best friend had used them.

I wish the nipples would have come in more than two stages though because when my daughter hit about 4 months, the slow flow were too slow and the fast flow were too fast. I ended up putting straight pins in the slow flow and boiling them with the pins in to open the holes a little more. It worked fine! The only time the bottle ever leaked was when I used the drop-in liners and that's because it wasn't seated right on the rim of the bottle. Many reviewers complained that the drop-ins don't hold a full 8 ozs. and they are correct. To solve this problem, I simply stuck with the standard liners and I don't buy the Playtex brand. I buy the Parent's Choice (PC) brand at Walmart. Another thing to be careful of is the measurements aren't always correct. I bought the Target brand 4 oz. liners and realized (after several bottles) that the 4 oz. mark on the liner was only 3 ozs. The PC liners are correct!

All-in-all, I like these bottles but am getting tired of the liners. I am currently reading reviews of other bottles and considering switching with our next child. I'm really liking what I'm reading about the Dr. Brown's, but will possibly try a couple other brands as well. I'm realizing that saving tons of money isn't always what's best for my daughter. We'll see!"

I have used them with all 3 of my children with great success and my oldest is almost 15.  Gas was never a problem and my babies hardly ever spit up.  Everyone always commented on how nice my babies always smelled because they never had that sour smell that babies that spit up so much do.  I worked in numerous daycare centers and any time a parent had problems with a gassy baby that spit up all the time I always recommend Platex Nursers to them.  9 x's out of 10 their problems were drastically reduced thanks to Playtex.  I am now pregnant with my 4th baby and though I plan to breastfeed as much as I can if I need a back up bottle or nursing doesn't work for some reason then Playtex will be my bottle of choice.  Of all the new bottles out there on the market Playtex will still be my number 1 bottle of choice.  If there would be any drawback at all it would be the cost of the liners.  But I often got lucky and would find some at yardsales or on sale and would stock up.  Also some store brands carry liners just as good.  I had a few plastic bottles around just in case of running out but my babies didn't like them nearly as much and I could always tell a difference in their happiness because they would get gassy again.

The instructions don't give you clear enough directions and I ended up putting the latching piece on upside down the first time. The pictures were pretty useless, but once you figure out the right way to install it goes in in a snap. To make it more stable you can keep the gate locked to swing only one direction which makes it extra stable against kids puching on it. 

We had to move our once our kitchen remodel was done and it came down simple and went up in a new door way really easy. 

The latch itself on ours has to be pushed down as it will not latch into place by itself now but it is a very solid gate. And for being over 2 years old it has held up great. The latch handle can't be opened by anyone with small hands as you have to squeeze both sides so anyone with kids under 2-3 who can open it have installed it wrong. Make sure the latch is hooked to the wall properly. "

This was a great find!  My son is almost 5 months old now, and he doesn't want to leave this bassinet (but it is definitely time, he is big for his age and is really outgrowing it).

Things I am happy about:

* I am able to see him without having to hardly lift my head at all, and can pick him up without having to strain or get out of bed... WONDERFUL!

* This is the mini co-sleeper, and is small and unobtrusive.  Fits nicely next to my side of our bed, with not a whole lot of extra room in that space.  Easy to tote around when traveling as well, once broken down is quite compact.

* Folds up very easily, similar to a pack-n-play but even easier I think, once you know how to do it (take the mattress out, press the buttons on the rails and fold).

* Has a great little place to store extra blankets, the instructions, the carrying case, etc, below, in a zipped-up compartment.


Things to note:

* The mattress is a bit hard (basically like a pack-n-play mattress, a board topped with some padding and a polyester or whatever material cover), so I top it with the sheet it came with, along with a blanket that I tuck tightly under the sides.

* The mattress does not sit flush with the side rails.  The lowered side rail sits at the same level as your bed, and the baby mattress is a bit lower than that... so the bassinet is not exactly an extension of your bed, you cannot just reach across and scoot baby to you (I thought it would be like that, but it isn't)... but actually I like this a bit better after all.

* They sell leg extensions that raise the bassinet to the height of your bed if need be.  We needed the extensions, and after putting them on the lower side rail was at the same level as our bed.  The extensions made the bassinet a bit wobbly, which worried me some, but turns out it is just fine, even with my 2-year-old bouncing around in it!

* Our little one did end up with his head against the side on a few occasions, but like someone else wrote, the one side is mesh, and he was just fine.  You kind of have to make sure the mattress lies level in its spot, kind of hard to explain without a visual aid, but basically the board in the mattress creates the level surface, underneath it is just a mesh screen that has Velcro to connect the sheet (which also has Velcro) in the right place.

Hopes this helps in your decision-making!"

Otherwise it was great to have & I was able to use it until my daughter was 8 months old (by then she could crawl out so it was not safe to use). It was nice to have her close for the middle of the night breastfeedings. And since we only have a queen bed, it was good to be able to put her into it after a feeding so my husband & I could have more room in the bed. Finally, for the middle of the night diaper changes or clothes changes (my daughter was a HUGE spitter upper) it was wonderful to have everything right there where I needed it. It was like a second changing table. I used it as a changing table while I was sitting on the bed. If I was standing, it was uncomfortably low. I had to bend down too much. (I'm 5'10"") One more thing-it's great for when your baby wants to nap. I rolled it close to the window when she was a newborn so she could get some sunlight to help rid her of jaundice."

This is one of the most beloved of all the toys that we bought our nephew, and he has lost the cars over the years. So I may buy it again just to get them back for him ... he loves it so much that when I called the other day, he was playing with the empty garage. 

The garage doors can get off track momentarily, but it's easy to fix. If you teach a child -- and the adults who play with him -- to put the cars back in their garages each time, it becomes a marvelously portable toy with which to play for hours. We gave it to him around 21 months and now at almost five, he still likes it. It's especially gratifying to see such love for a no-tech toy from a kid who constantly receives toys that light up, beep, and do other 21st-century tricks. Here is a simple toys that brings hours of fun for years and years"

* The velcro straps at the bottom aren't long enough so they don't stay done.

Knight ""new mom""","Atlanta, GA","I *LOVE* this product.  It's a far better velcro swaddler than the other brands because it uses bigger patches of velcro.  In comparison to a blanket, this is much easier to use and provides much more durable swaddles.  I'm quite good with a blanket, but by six weeks of age, my son could wriggle out.  On the other hand, at three months, he's never wriggled out of the cotton flannel Swaddleme.

However, even in cold weather, the microfleece is too hot.  Several times I've felt under the blanket to find my son sweaty.  It's even worse when we combine the swaddle with a sling.  On the other hand, the cotton knit (solid colors) blankets are too stretchy - my son quickly converts his knit Swaddleme into a toga, leaving both arms flying free.  The cotton flannel (gingham prints) has less stretch than the other two fabrics, and plenty enough cover to keep a baby warm at indoor temperatures.  It is trickier to find, but worth the search.

The microfleece Swaddleme does, however, make a great non-swaddle blanket on cold days, particularly when the baby is in a front carrier.  The velcro is quite versatile. "

I didn't like the Symphony at all b/c the diaphragm that goes on the machine has to be really tight or it won't have good suction (which is most of the time).  I'm on my third PIS advanced.  With my first child, I had the PIS advanced backpack, first generation, and pumped for a year.  The amount of milk was adequate (had enough frozen away for extra month after I stopped).  I just didn't like the faceplate (I broke 3, where you attach the tubing to the faceplate), and the storage space for the backpack is very limited.  Then I bought the PIS advanced shoulder bag with my second child.  The storage area is better but the faceplate is still the same.  Then the PIS advanced limited edition came out.  I saw it and fell in love with it.  So I had to get it.  It's the nicest one thus far and long overdue.  The motor sits in a separate bag and the tubing can fit in the side pocket.  There is no danger of breaking the faceplate. I can just carry that to and from work.  I have two sets of parts, one for home and one at work). The bag has lots of storage space and best of all, it's chic.  They have blue, chocolate and black.  It also doubles as a diaper bag for me.

As for hands free pumping:  the only reason I was able to pump for a year fist time and now 11mo and still going is b/c of the hands free pumping kit.  You have to get the Medela softcup bras (they're comfy anyway) that supports handsfree pumping.  There are 2 tabs inside on the bottom and one latch on the top.  You don't need to buy the whole hands free pumping kit; you just need the loop and hook attachment (part #3007073).  That hooks onto the top of the bra where there is a latch.  Then you tie a rubber band (thicker kind from any office supply store) around the tabs (3 of them, two sewn in the bra and one from the loop and hook attachment).  Then you put the breastshield with connector with bottles attached on your breast.  Then you loop the rubber band separately around the connector (the part where you're suppose to attach the tubing).  Connect the tubing, Viola, it should stay there snugly.  You don't have to hold them anymore.  You can also use this method with the softfit breastshield.  If you have larger breasts, use bigger rubberbands or link two together.  Now you can massage to get more milk, eat lunch, type on the computer, whatever (just can't lie down).  You can buy adapter for avent system and pump directly into their bottles, or other brands.  And there is no need to pump every 3-4h after your milk supply is established... that's insane. In the first few weeks it may be necessary to establish supply. I pumped 4 times a day and was able to get min 30oz a day (I was bottle feeding breastmilk exclusively), then slowly decreased to 3, to 2 to 1 as my baby got older.  The key is to pump all the milk out (with massaging and squeezing your breast) and then let it run 1-2min longer.  Also, use the maximum suction you can tolerate (this will increase and plateau as you pump).  If you want to decrease supply, just pump shorter and longer period of time lapse in between pumping.  If you want to increase, pump longer and more frequently as well as drink more water/eat more.  I could increase and decrease my supply at will, even without breastfeeding.  

I pumped directly into 9 oz or 11 oz avent bottles using the avent adapter (avail at Babiesrus).  There are other systems out there.  I used the lansinoh milk storage bags to store my milk.  I store about 10-12oz (max 12oz) in each bag, squeeze all the air out, and deep freeze it for 6mo.  I know lansinoh suggest less than that, but it can be done as long as you get all the air out.  The trick is to use the side of a table, push the milk up to the ziplock and squeeze close the ziplock as the air is pushed out.  Since there are two zippers, a little milk can leak out of the first zipper to help get all the air out.  The bag will expand in the freezer just fine.  Once it's frozen, just don't nick the bag (b/c it's easy to damage it) and it will stay fine for 6mo in a deep freezer.  Even if you do damage the bag, it's ok.  it's just a pain when you thaw it. When you thaw the milk, you might see a little precipitate, but baby likes the milk just like it was fresh.

Happy pumping"

Due to medical problems early on I had to exclusivly pump for child #1. The pump worked great. I used it several times a day and it was very effective and comfortable. I used it for about 3 months straight after she was born. I stopped using it not because it wore out, but because pumping several times a day for months was so much work that I couldn't keep doing it. My determination ran out before the pump's did! After that I packed it up and planned on using it again if I had another child. 

Child #2 was born early December 2007 and I was very pleased to find that my Medela pump was still in excellent working order. Child #2 was a professional breastfeeder from day 1 so I only used the pump when trying to boost my supply or to relieve pressure from engorgment when the baby wasn't hungry. I'd say I used it a few times a week for the first 2 months. After 2 months I had to go back to work and my Pump in Style came with me. I've been working for a few weeks now and I use the pump twice a day. It works as good today as it did 3 years ago. The quality has not gone down one bit. I plan on feeding child #2 exclusivly breastmilk as long as possible and I'm confident that my breastpump will allow me to do so. 

If you plan on going back to work and pumping, or if you plan on having multiple children then this is a great pump for the job. It LASTS. Its expensive, but better to spend the money upfront, get a pump that works great, is effective, comfortable, and will last you through the years than to throw money away on a cheaper model that you'll end up replacing. 

The pump is so great that I'm willing to bet that it'll last right through child #2 and if we decided to have another child, it will be ready to go again in a few more years."

Plus, the bag is good-looking and you wouldn't even know it's a breast pump. And the pump itself works well.

What I was not thrilled about is that the bottles didn't come with nipples and the Medela nipples are not easy to find on their own. I had to buy a separate pump and store starter kit (4 bottles, caps, nipples) to get a decent supply. Also, the pump is a little louder than I thought it would be but if you zip the pump's compartment while you're pumping, it does cut down on the noise. Another thing is that I expected there to be different speeds of pumping like there was in the Ameda hospital pump I rented for a couple of weeks but even at $319, it has only one speed (although you can adjust the vacuum strength). 

Last, and this isn't directed specifically at this pump but at all pumps that can pump both breasts simultaneously... I don't think they're worth it. I don't really even pump both breasts at the same time anymore because it's not easy to sit there holding both cups over both breasts on top of adjusting the dials and possibly holding or trying to soothe a baby. I constantly broke the suction seals and dripped milk on my lap. And I spent so much time readjusting the cups and trying to get comfortable that I could have just pumped one breast at a time (which I do now). Fortunately, the Medela pump works pretty fast magic on me."

So I rented the Medela Symphony for a month ($90 + starter kit). That pump was amazing but at 90 a month not so practical. So I bought the PiS Advance. Although it's not as efficient as the hospital grade Symphony this pump does an amazing job. It's much quiter than the original and has the 2 phase suction. Not only is the 2 phase suction more efficient, I have found that the initial short suck phase preps my body for the more intense longer pulls that follow. For most I'm sure the original is fantastic but if you're very sensitive the Pump in Style Advance is what you need (unless you want to shell out $90 a month. The Symphony retails at around $1250.00.

Having this car seat/stroller is great if you are travelling with small kids; they sleep comfortably in it and makes for more efficient transfer between gates. I share the observation that others made regarding its inability to take bumps... for that reason it is not a good choice beyond travel and maybe use within a shopping mall.

It's not the best carseat out there, and is a tad inconvenient in some areas, but the ease of converting it to a stroller and taking my little girl into stores with it, far outweigh the other annoyances.

One thing I will say - when the carseat is in the rear-facing position, it does tilt forward a bit for my liking.  When my girl falls asleep her head is usually hanging forward because of the forward slant.

The seatbelt has to go over the top of the seat, so you have to reattach everything every time you put your baby into it and that can get a little annoying.

The stroller part is great though.  And it's SO EASY to adjust the tightness of the straps.

Despite the small wheels, it's actually a very smooth ride on concrete and bumpy parking lots.  Much smoother then any shopping cart with her carseat in it, ever was - lol.

We looked at strollers from Mountain Buggy, Valco, Baby Jogger, Phil & Ted, Dreamer Designs, etc. (we were willing to spend a good amount on a quality stroller, but we were not about to go for a Bugaboo).

We decided on the Bob Revolution and we have been very happy with it.

PROS
1. It is very easy to push over all kinds of surfaces and up hill as well as to steer with one hand.
2. The canopy is by far the best we've seen on any kind of stroller.
3. The front wheel swivels 360 degrees and can lock.
4. It folds/unfolds easily.
5. The seat is roomy and seems reasonably comfortable.
6. The shock absorbers do more than on the few other strollers that have shocks.
7. For a stroller of this size/category, it is not too wide, so we can bring it into small shops and navigate tight aisles and turns easily.
8. Although not compact, at least this stroller folds up to a decent size that is easy to fit into a car - most strollers in this category are much longer and a little wider than this when folded up.
9. Wheels are easily removable.
10. Not too heavy - lighter than similar strollers of this type.
11. Plenty of accessories available.
12. Good, rugged build quality.
13. Wheels are made of sturdy plastic = nothing to rust.

CONS
1. The seat does not recline very far, and it requires you to adjust two straps (one on either side of the top of the seat back).
2. The footrest is not adjustable, and I would have preferred a metal/plastic kick plate.
3. When you fold the stroller, it is a little awkward to carry because the front wheel sticks out and you can't keep it folded up without rigging the wrist strap - a simple locking mechanism would be better.
4. Storage basket could be a little bigger.
5. Handlebar is not adjustable, however it is high enough for me (over 6' tall).
6. Seat could use a little more padding.  Our son seems to be more comfortable in our little Combi.
7. No included accessories.

Keep in mind that this kind of stroller is typically stored in a garage and not folded up all the time.  This is an excellent stroller and worth the money.

FYI, here's the main reasons why we selected this stroller over similar ones from:
Mountain Buggy - canopy doesn't provide much sun protection, too big when folded, seat seams uncomfortable (hammock style, limited padding = squishes the child's shoulders in); great build quality though and easy to fold up.
Valco - too difficult to fold up, expensive; fancy stroller with good padding; optional toddler jumper seat looks uncomfortable for toddler if used more than briefly.
Phil & Ted's - seems less sturdy, fabric footrest too close to wheel so kids can actually push and impede the front wheel; optional second seat is innovative design, but sacrifices the storage area.

Alternative: We were'nt able to actually see/test one, but the Boogie by Zooper looks interesting because it has a great feature set, adjustable footrest with kickplate, full reclining seat back, and comes with great accessories.  Apparently, the 2006 model has been redesigned to be lighter and fix some issues in older models"

We didn't want to leave him in the car seat for an hour because (1)he would get restless and (2) the babies can get flat spots on the backs of their heads from frequent pressures of car seats/swings.    
The Bumbo allows you to sit your child (if they are unable or unstable sitting on their own) in front of you so you can face them and interact with them without having to support them.
We took our child to a baby class and all of the babies had one of these.  It really helped free up parents' hands so they could play with the children versus holding them up.

After the first two months though, I decided that the Isis was rather uncomfortable to use, and the massaging breast shield kept losing suction and leaking milk out the back, so I started researching pumps again.  

I knew I wanted a Medela, but some of their pumps weigh in at 8 pounds, and I knew I didn't want anything that NEEDED to use the complimentary ""stylish backpack"".  When I found the Swing, and read the reviews, I knew it was what I wanted.  It is nearly as compact as hand pumps, but uses the same two stage action as the more expensive Medela pumps.  It is comfortable to use, I've had no problems with leaking, it seems more efficient and in general I just really like this pump.  You can use double A batteries to power it, which is great if you are traveling (Airport? Camping?)  The best part though, came about five minute ago when I realized that the threads on the Swing match the threads on the skinny Airvent bottles that are the only ones we can get DD to use!!  No more random bottles, and no more pumping in to one container and then pouring into another container to use"

I LOVE THE SWING. THe Swing is as efficient, if not more, as the SYmphony. THe fact that it is a single pump does not bother me at all because it is so efficient I am done pumping in 20 minutes - both sides. It is so lightweight and portable that you can go anywhere. After a month of being tied to the huge Symphony every three hours, it was a wonderful and welcome change to be able to go places with the pump.

Renting it cost $[...] a month if you can find a place to rent it.. I did and used it for a month.. I honestly was not totally impressed for the price. Then I read up on the swing this pump ALSO (like the symphony) includes the Medela 2-Phase Expression Technology - the new standard for unsurpassed naturalness, comfort and efficiency. AND after buying it.. I liked it BETTER then the symphony. Infact I think it works just about the exact same, which is crazy of Medela when the price is SO different. I have tried the Medela Pump in style as well as the Avant Isis and this one is the best. 

I would highly reccommend this pump. 
POSITIVES:
This pump is portable. Comes with a travel bag, runs on batteries OR you can plug it in. The pump itself is about the size of a Hardees Hamburger. The breast shield is soft and very effective, you can control the speed and it has the letdown mode as well that automatically turns on after a few minutes. The breast shield is soft and comfortable, the suction and speed is the same as the symphony, the pump is SIMPLE to use, FOUR buttons-you can't NOT figure it out easily! It is FAST and emptys your breast totally. 

NEGATIVES: (I have to stretch on this one cause I love the pump) It's not quiet, I don't know why the other review says it is.. It's actually louder then I thought it should be.. but not louder then the Medela Pump in style or symphony. But just not ""quiet"" I don't want you thinking you are going to get something you can pump with at the front of a mini van and noone in the back is going to hear..  
It's a Single Pump... I know.. DUH.. but it is a negative, if only they made a double with this size base, I'm almost tempted to buy another. 

I highly reccommend this pump, as a mom of three, I've tried a lot of pumps.. I think Medela is selling this pump short saying it is like the pump in style, I think it is comparable to the symphony!"

(My mom used a similar method with me in 1977 and recommended it) It worked really really well! He took a bit longer to learn to go poopoo at first, until I realized that HE thought he was ""making messies"" if he went in the toilet. I solved this by taking him around the house and showing him that the dishes go in the cupboard, clothes in the closet, toys in the toy box and poopoo in the toilet. He totally got it after that.
He only had a couple accidents that I recall. I reminded him to go pee pee quite a lot at first, which I believed helped. I stopped all liquid drinking an hour to and hour 1/2 before bedtime and had him pee right before bed and right after getting up. 
I would highly recommend this prodect to everyone who's ready to potty train. :"

I used this lid lock with my toddler from 10 months until 3 years. The best thing about it, is that it works well, but does not have to be attached with adhesive, so it can be installed and removed easily for use or cleaning. I think that the previous reviewer must have had a strange potty, or more likely, just had it installed improperly.  If used properly, it clamps onto the rim of the potty without being permanently attached.  I found it was difficult to remove, and couldn't remove it just by pulling.  It also doesn't rattle if it's installed on the front half of the toilet and NOT under the little buttons that keep the seat off of the rim.  I have tried it on a variety of toilets.  We were able to have a spare for travel, so every toilet was safe.  I really can't understand what went wrong for the previous reviewer.  I wish I could help her try to install it so it would work. There are two sizes of clamps to fit different sizes of toilet rims, I found I had to use one for our very old upstairs potty and the other for the more modern downstairs potty. You HAVE to clamp them tightly on the rim though, or it won't work, and would certainly rattle.  Maybe that was the problem.

The base is a clamp that's adjustable to fit the rim of the toilet tightly.  Then there's a swing-up/down latch that clamps over the lid and seat keeping both of them down.  You have to lift two buttons at the same time as you lift the latch, I found I could easily do it with one hand while holding a newborn, but my toddler, who could easily defeat all of our cabinet, drawer, and door locks just couldn't do it.  Because I did it one handed the trick wasn't obvious.

Well, I recommend this to all my friends, and will buy more for my new house"

I actually liked the idea of this bouncer because the puppy is more upbeat rather than soothing like the other bouncers so my baby gets some playtime.  By the time he gets tired, the puppy and music shuts off and he sleeps peacefully in the vibrating chair.  My ONLY minor complaint is I wish the ball on the toy bar cracked or squeaked.

Dufek,USA- Arizona,"both my 4 year old and my little daughter 5 month old hate having their noses suctioned! My little girl has reflux and spits up a lot,  due to that she always has quite some Milkbuggers up her nose and to add to that, she's teething like a Mammoth right now which makes her congested as well. First she wanted to sqirm away, but the hummingsound that comes from it and the nice Tune it plays destracted her! Since it vibrates quite a bit I first touch her cheek with it so she knows what to expect and she immidetly calmes down and today started even to giggle because it tickled her nose!

The long and short tip are both very soft and have no sharp edges and the suction is very gentle. Yes, I do agree that it won't suck crusties out of the nose but even with a bulb,  hard stuff should be soaked for a couple of seconds with a squirt of saline up the nose to soften it. Once you do that the bigger buggers will come out with the big tip!

I personally find the Bulbs to invasive and the aspirators in Hospital pretty strong, so strong that not even the stuff will use them unless the Babys oxygen drops due to stuffiness in the nose! I KNOW I just spent 1 week in the hospital in February with my duaghter due to RSV, and yes those aspirators there shouldn't be used  unless there is no other way (but even there they use always saline first to soften the stuff and then use the suction)

Oh, by the way, the Aspirator comes with a handy little sack to store the tips and the easy to take apart and clean Aspirator! sure, the Suction is not as strong as the Hospital one but the Hospital cannot be used as often as you want to, this one is gentle enough and even fun for the little ones while giving them relieve and can be used as needed it is that gentle!

I was surprised to learn that babies can't clear their own noses until they are about 3 years old.  I tried using the manual bulb aspirator but my little one would get frustrated and I would have limited success clearing his nose.  It usually took several attempts to get into the nostril and once there, I was only able to get good suction about 1/3 of the time.  Maybe others have better luck than me but these are my stats.

I ordered the NasalClear about a week ago.  I was concerned that the vacuum might be too strong for little noses or that the tips would be too invasive.  The vacuum is very gentle.  I prefer the shorter, stouter tip as it seems less likely to go too far up the nostril.  Either tip is certainly shorter than the one on the manual bulb.  The suction, while being gentle, is very effective at cleaning the nostril.  I was surprised by how much a little nostril could hold.  That being said, the NasalClear comes with a collecion cup that has a max fill line on it that seems absurdly large.  I have yet to get even a drop into the chamber (there is quite a bit of storage space in the tubes leading to the chamber that does get filled) so I can't even imagine filling it.  

I don't find the music feature to be very important.

It's a great product that works well and doesn't irritate my baby.  So far, there hasn't been a tear caused by NasalClear--which is a huge improvement over the manual bulb"

1) You can angle it so that it custom fits your space. You can also make it longer or shorter without having to buy extensions.
2) It has a gate, so you don't have to continuously step over it or take it down.
3) Its soft mesh material means fewer bumps on the head for our little one.
4) The gate slowly closes after you walk through it (but it doesn't latch shut, FYI).

Cons: 
1) Although the gate can be opened with one hand, it's not the easiest (you have to move a button and then lift up, not a huge deal, though).
2) Its also not the easiest to close (have to lift up and then push down).
3) It's wall mounted (not pressure mounted), so it leaves holes in the wall.

It makes traveling so much easier now that I can leave baby without a big bunting and know she'll be warm and cozy. The zippers are great - almost 6 months of use every single day and not a problem. I have washed it several times and it looks like new and has held up wonderfully. I have used it on windy days, when I was a bit sceptical about it being windproof, and it stood the test. Moving it from the carseat to the stroller is a sinch with the velcro closures in the back. I don't have any cons to list this has been such a great item for us"

Our crib arrived in an almost perfect condition. The only reason I did not give it 5 star rating is because one piece that we're going to need when we convert to toddler bed has a chip in it; it is not too bad though. Also, assembling the crib was not a problem at all for my husband and one of our friends. Following the instructions, they were able to assemble in about 1 and 1/2 hour. 
As I said before, we're very satisfied with our selection, now we're just waiting for our baby girl (due March 21, 2006) to see how she likes it.

We found this one to be the most versatile and the least likely to catch his fingers in the tray. I also like that it has a five-point harness. I see that a lot of people had problems with their babies reaching the tray. Our son is very tall, so this wasn't a problem for us. I also find it easy to clean, the straps come off and are machine washable and I use a damp cloth to wipe it down. It folds up nicely to go to grandma's house and it's nice to have so many levels of adjustment so that we can feed from the couch if necessary. The chair leans back for those times that he eats from a bottle or wants to snooze in his chair. It wheels easily from dining room to kitchen to living room. I know that it's pricey, but it supports kids up to 50 lbs, so I plan to use it for a while and it's durable enough that I'm sure someone else will get plenty of use out of it after we're done."

"B000B5HELW:great_bag,_stylish_and_functional._:sister_big_bones",B000B5HELW,Combi Urban Sling Diaper Bag Black: Baby,baby,12 of 12,5.0,"Great bag, stylish and functional. ","November 9, 2006",Sister Big Bones,Jersey,"I have purchased several diaper bags and received several at my shower. As a person who loves pocketbooks, I'm horribly picky about any bag. But a diaper bag especially should be functional and stylish. The COMBI urban sling is just that. At the time of this writing, I've only had it a week, so I can't speak to it's durability. 

What you can't see in the pictures on this site are the many pockets in the bag. The front flap closes messenger-style via velcro. There's a zipped pocket which spans the width of the front flap inside the front flap. 

Upon opening the front flap velcro, there are two pen holders and two compartments/pockets which will fit a wallet, or checkbook or even diapers if that's where you want to put them. 

There is a zipped compartment on the side of the bag which holds one bottle. This is the only drawback; that only one bottle can go in the insulated compartment. However, in the part of the bag which is the deepest, there are two deep compartments and one zippered compartment on top of a spacious inside. The bottle thing was remedied for me by putting another bottle on the inside compartment in a ziploc bag ( to keep the temperature). 

The shoulder is heavily padded in the middle of the bag, which is a joy on my shoulders. And the key holding section is convenient as well. 

On the back of the bag is a compartment which holds a large changing pad. This is one of the best features as the changing pad itself isn't bulky and taking up oo gobs of diaper bag space. 

I took this bag to the hardest possible test site: the suburban mall. This was his first trip there and I was able to pack two nine ounce bottles, wipes, diapers, a change of clothes, his medicines, disposable changing pads, a receiving blankie (albeit thin), my wallet and essentials and still had pockets in the bag that were empty. With the rubberized shoulder pad I didn't have to worry about the bag falling off of my shoulder as it rubbed against my shirt. (I know I'm not the only one who is sick of readjusting bags on their shoulder over and over). And the way it is designed, it leaned flat on my hip instead of jutting out. Made turning those store corners with a stroller much less difficult. 

And the bag came in super handy on his doctor's visit yesterday in the middle of heavy rain. The material seems waterproof. 

I really love this bag. As I'm on maternity leave now, I am using it strictly for the baby. However, as someone who works in social services and is often at meetings and in the field in neighborhoods, I can see using this bag transitioning to work upon my return. If it holds up, it also seems the perfect bag for those theme park trips. Overall it was money well spent. "

First, it doesn't look like a diaper bag.  It can pass for a purse and looks very sporty.  I don't feel like a frumpy mom while carrying this.  Also, it carries quite a bit without looking bulky.  I regulary carry wipes, diapers for my infant and my potty-training toddler, plus at least one change of clothes for each child in the two larger compartments.  I still have room for my keys, wallet, cell phone, sun glasses, and a hair brush in the two inner zippered pockets.  

I only gave it 4 stars because the shoulder strap needs a little more padding.  But, overall, it is a great diaper bag. "

I mounted the camera for the widest possible angle -- near the ceiling in a corner of his room -- and now I can check on him all night long.

I especially like the time-out feature that turns off the display screen after a few minutes but leaves the audio monitor on when the monitor is operating on its battery. The display is turned on by a big button on top so if you hear something that you want to check out, just push the button and the room is in view. It's very nice.

They are great most of the time.  I freeze about 10-12oz in each bag (yes, they say no more than 6oz, it's a myth). 12 is the maximum I found tho. The trick is to make sure there is no air.  It won't leak b/c the bag will expand, unlike plastic storage containers.  I use the straight edge of a table, push the milk all the way to the top and zip it as I push the air out.  Don't worry if a little leaks out b/c it has a double zipper.  Then I freeze it on a flat surface singly.  After it's frozen, I put 8-10 of these in a big gallon zip lock bag and date the outside and put it in deep freezer.  It's easier to organize them this way in deep freeze.

The bad thing about these bags is that once frozen, the plastic nicks easily if you drop it, scrape it against something, etc (as with all frozen containers).  Lansinoh had really bad problem with leakage before but they've improved.  Just thaw the bag in a container in case it leaks.

It doesn't need any tools to assemble it, just to open the battery compartment (small flat head screwdriver). The instructions are clear and easy to follow.

The walker itself looks cheap but actually I was surprised how sturdy it is once put together. I do have to say that the washable seat for this is a little tough snapping into place so I won't want to remove it much to wash it... still that is a small price to pay for safety.

the front wheels are casters which rotate in a complete 360. the back wheels jsut go forward or backwards... this is a safety feature, as are the traction strips on the underside of the walker. The baby will only be able to move backwards at first, but with a little time, s/he will be cruising all over.

I am a little concerned about the activity toys on the tray. From the reviews, it looks like baby may bang her mouth a little. If that is the case, it will take me 2 minutes to detatch the toys and save it for later when she has more control. Also, the sound for the toys is actually not bad. Most toys have 2 volume settings; loud and louder... this one (in my opinion)actually has 2 real volue conrols... soft and medium.Still If I ever get annoyed at the noise, I can turn it off by flipping the switch... or just let the battery run out.

the worst part of the whole thing is adjsuting it to different height levels... I found it easier to turn the walker upside down and adjsut it that way... still, my thumbs will be bruised for days for all the pressure it took to adjust.

Hope this helps... definately worth the $40"

This is the best seat protector I found for several reasons:
- It doesn't smell. I had to return everything I had bought at Babies R Us due to a heavy rubber smell that never went away even after airing the products for a week.
- It's made of two pieces so it can be used in stages. Use the bottom piece only when using a rear-facing infant seat, or both pieces when using a front-facing car seat.
- It's made of two pieces so it fits any height car seat. I have a Britax car seat which is really tall. The other seat protectors did not reach all the way to the top of my SUV's seat, so the car seat rested directly on the leather, but with this seat protector, I could raise the back piece as high as I needed it to fully protect my SUV's seat.
- It's thick enough that even after months of use, there's no marks on the SUV's leather seats.
- It has indentations in the bottom portion to accommodate car seats using the latch system.

A note on the height issue: A friend of mine bought the Duomat 2-In-1 Car Seat Mat, which he found to be very nice as well and it did not smell. He had to return it however due to the fact that the mat was not as high as the seat of his Honda Odyssey, and his Britax Marathon car seat at the very top rested directly on the Honda seat with no protector in between"

I received it as a gift and I'm so glad that I registered for it. True, the velcro isn't too strong, which makes it slip if alot of heavy items are placed on it. However, I used the strategy that another reviewer used and tied it to the crib with some pretty ribbon and it works wonderfully. I have powder, lotion, baby oil, vaseline, some shoes, as well as a package of diapers and a few more items stored in it and it is holding up fine. I think this organizer can be a very useful and convenient way to keep the much needed items close at hand, especially if you are lacking storage space. I would definitely recommend this item to anyone and I'm so glad that I did finally register for it.

I love that the entire thing is hard plastic, without any fabric--all you have to do is wipe and go.  No staining or mildewing or anything like that.  We have 2, one to use and one to spare and that's all we need.  The mechanism for clasping is very easy to hook and unhook (for mom or dad), but  is secure enough that your little one won't easily pull it off.  It's also adjustable for little necks and bigger necks alike.  We've used several types of pocketed bibs in the past, but now that we've found this one we will never need another kind.

I never experienced sore nipples with him. My second son is a whole different story though. For some reason my second son just didn't want to open his mouth wide enough to get a good latch on, so that made for excruciatingly sore nipples for me for about the first two weeks of nursing. It was torture - pure torture. A nurse at the hospital gave me these gel patches to help with my sore nipples and I must say, I don't know what I would have done with out them (I probably would have given up on breastfeeding). I tried the nipple cream and that did help a bit, but these gel patches are really what made breastfeeding manageable for me. I healed faster wearing them than I did with the nipple cream. If you put the patches in the fridge for a couple of minutes then put them on they feel really great. 

This is a wonderful product and I attribute them to getting over that huge breastfeeding hurtle for the first two weeks.  "

Good clear signal even between multi-floors.  Durable hand sets with a easy to use switch between the base (the babies room) and the other hand set.  Easy to use. durable and reliable. Good volumn control. Good response from manufacture and from Amazon when a switch went bad.  Can't ask for more than that even if it cost twice what I paid.  I strongly recommend this set and product. I have used others and they can't touch this one. My babies and more importantly my wife's emotional well being were a serious consideration on finding something that would make them feel safe and in communication.

Downsides:
A little annoying is the loud beep you hear before speaking.
And the rechargable battery (on the two parents units) don't hold very long. After a couple of months of use, we have to recharge them now every three days - we use them about 4 hours a day.

We have a more expensive, larger, ""safer"" stroller with more features, but we have found we never use it and always use this one.

Collapsing the stroller to pop into the car is a breeze, and there is an adequate shoulder strap for you to carry the stroller when you are doing portage over rough ground.

We take the stroller everywhere. We've used it on well-groomed trails for hiking, museums, restaurants, we've even used it at the beach, and we've used it on the Paris Metro. This is a great stroller for train and subway travel.

The wheels have a lock feature which allows them to rotate, or swivel, and the rear wheels have a brake mechanism which is a little awkward to release, but I find that comforting rather than frustrating: I want solid brakes.

There is a small basket in the back of the stroller for a baby bag, purse, and a few groceries, so this again is an excellent stroller for when you are just running out for a few things or going on a small picnic. If I was an apartment dweller in the city, this is the stroller I'd get.

The only bad feature: this is not a stroller you can run with! Don't even try.

The harness is excellent, but takes time to adjust it correctly so that it is not too snug nor too loose. This is a super lightweight stroller, but is a quality product with excellent engineering and design. It is not like those flimsy twenty-dollar throwaways and just has the MacLaren name on it: this is the real deal. We have used it for two kids, still works like new.

I suggest reading the directions before tossing these sippy cups in the trash.  I cannot get over how many parents assume that the Avent line is alot of ""hype"" just because they failed to read directions.
As for the complaints about mold and sour milk...that's just gross.  Wash the sippy cup after it's used.  I'm sure any other brand would get moldy and smelly if you left it in your trunk all summer...not Avent's fault!
Anyway, as for the green spouts being stiffer than the white ones and more difficult to clean...OK, maybe for the first few times because they are new; but they WILL get more pliable.  I spoke to an Avent rep at the Baby Fair in Edison, NJ and she suggested buying new spouts every month or so (same for nipples with Avent bottles).  They do wear out...especially if you're using the same two or three sippy cups every day.
I just bought (and tried) the ""sport spout"" and although it is quite a mouthful of liquid that comes out, our son has no problem with that spout, either.  No leaks so far.
All in all, read the directions and you will see the leaks disappear like MAGIC!  Good luck"

The soft spout on these cups is great, and made transitioning to a cup SO easy for us. My son hasn't taken a bottle since his first birthday, and never missed them a bit. There are two levels of spouts, one harder one softer. I've tried other soft spout brands, but have had leaking from the collars. Avent cups NEVER leak as long as the valves are inserted correctly. Our little guy will use any brand or spout type, but these are his favorite and nice on sore gums.

I really recommend these cups despite the extra valve pieces (which I simply pop in the dishwasher in a basket). You'll never have spills on your sofa or carpet"

When I brought it home my son instantally fell in love with it for the shear fact that he could move around pretty freely he really enjoys it. It is a little basic in design and I have found that the toys do not stay put for very long they are not made very well and are very basic. My main problem with this walker is that it is a pain in the butt to put away it doesn't fold up easily and it doesn't stay folded for very long. I also am having problems ajusting the height of the walker my friend put it all the way down and now I can't get it to go back up so my son's is basically standing all by himself when he is in it (which I am not complaining about)

I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep, then put her in her crib... and she'd flail her arms, wake up and cry, and I had to start all over! What a nightmare! 

Then I figured out that since her arms wake her, it would make sense to wrap her in something so she couldn't move them as much... so I started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets. It worked! It became much easier to get her to sleep. But then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again. 

When she was a little over a month old, somehow I came across SwaddleMe blankets on the Internet and immediately bought it. It worked like a charm! It was so easy to wrap my daughter in it, and it stayed put. My daughter started sleeping so much better! 

I wish I found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me from so many sleepless nights!

My advice is to purchase only one of these before birth and then if your baby enjoys being swaddled then purchase more, if not you can return it or not and not feel bad that it was only $9.99. 

Also remember once babies can move their hands around more freely they should not be swaddled."

As such, she simply didn't fit into her regular car seat anymore.  To be honest, I was a little apprehensive about switching her from a car seat to a booster seat before the age of 3, but she was VERY uncomfortable in her car seat and would cry whenever we stuffed her into it.  So, I bit the proverbial bullet and bought this booster.  One feature that really interested me in this seat was portability.  My father lives out of state so we will be doing a lot of traveling.  I wanted a seat we could easily check on an airplane.  This seat fit the bill.  The seat is not as compact as I would have hoped, but it is no bigger than a small piece of luggage and could be easily carried onto a plane.  However, I think this seat will be a little cumbersome to ""carry on"" if you are trying to manage getting onto a plane with a 2 and a half year old and everything else that comes with her (coloring books, portable dvd player, snacks etc); so I will more than likely check this seat.  As such I am going to order the carrying case (I saw in some reviews that some folks checked the seat in the box it came in, but I find that to be too cumbersome). As for the seat itself, my daughter LOVES it.  She is very comfortable in it and calls it her ""big girl seat"" -- no more fights getting her into her seat!!! I LOVE that it has a compartment to store the owner's manual in so that you always have it at hand. Also, even though it is not a five point harness, I feel my daughter is very secure in it.  I love that it has the wrap around headrest, and the height couldn't be easier to adjust -- we figured it out before we even opened the manual.  When you thread the shoulder belt through the ""catch"" under the headrest, it positions the belt correctly over your child's body so that he/she is not choked by it.  (Make sure you pull the belt all the way out and then let it slowly wind itself back until it is taut over your child -- this will lock the belt in place).  I would have given this seat five stars if it folded down a little more compactly and/or came with the carrying case (it has a built in handle, but if you are going to check this on a plane, I would feel more comfortable having it in something to protect the fabric from ripping, staining etc).  Overall this is a GREAT product which is comparably priced to other full booster seats which don't fold.  I have recommended this to my friends"

Walts,"Rochester, NY, USA","Years ago with my first child, I learned to hate those clichÃ©, oversized diaper bags, especially when most of my outings were short errands. Why bring what amounts to a piece of luggage on those short trips? This diaper bag is the ULTIMATE in functionality for brief jaunts, holding a truly amazing amount of stuff, but holding it stylishly, to boot. It may look small, but I can carry three or four diapers, a small container of wipes, a change of clothes, a nursing shawl, a burp cloth or two, spare baby socks and a hat, a teething ring or two, a snack, my wallet, keys, Palm pilot, a tube of diaper rash cream, and a few other odds and ends in there with no problem. There are lots of zip compartments to keep it all organized. I get a lot of compliments on it, which is strange considering it's a diaper bag. In fact, a woman stopped me in the store the other day and wanted to know where I'd gotten it, because it was ""exactly the purse she'd been looking for""-- she was shocked to learn it was a diaper bag! It's sporty enough that my husband and 13-y.o. son don't mind carrying it, either. If you're going on a day trip, you'll need something bigger, but for those typical ""quickie"" errands, you can't beat this bag"

I liked that the Buggy Bagg *completely* covered anywhere the baby might touch.  It comes with a pillow but frankly the padded back and seat were so comfortable that I never needed to use the it.

I'm glad we bought both! The thicker Urban has been great in the colder weather.  It's thicker, and so stiffer, than the Lite, which makes it easier for me to zip up in the carseat and then fold the 'flap' down to leave my daughter's face exposed. In windy, cold or nasty weather I bring the flap up to cover her completely for the short outdoor time between car and destination.
The Lite is flimsier, and was perfect for early Fall and I'm starting to use it in the stroller for warmer winter days.  I personally prefer the stiffer Urban, but the Urban is so much warmer than the Lite I'm glad to have both.
Switching the 2 is very easy and takes only a minute or two.
With both versions, we just put on a hat and the baby is ready to go! No jackets or snowsuits needed.
We also have a set of Cushy Straps (cute fleece animal-shaped covers for the stroller/carseat straps that cushion the straps AND help keep the child's head from lolling around) and those help keep the top of baby from being too exposed when you have the Bundle Me folded down or partially unzipped"

I also use it on my stroller during walks, and even in 40 degree weather, my son is able to take a cozy nap while I get my exercise.

It attaches very easily to the carseat, and I can leave all the extra blankets at home (except for a light one). This particular model is wind and rain resistant, which is nice for keeping my little one dry. It's a great concept; kudos to whomever invented it!

I do have 2 complaints though. First, it's not as effective for younger babies. My daughter is just 7 weeks old, and I don't zip up all the way. This keeps the fabric out of her face. I will use one light blanket until she is bigger and the Bundle Me is a bit more snug around her.  Secondly, the zippers aren't as smooth as I'd like them to be. They occasionally catch the fabric on the inside, so zipping up is sometimes more work, and always when I'm in a hurry!

But overall, I'm glad I bought this. It's nice having a barrier against the wind, rain and cold with just one item"

So far, the Clean Shopper is working pretty well for us.

The fabric is thick, so it doesn't make a tiny package.  It also doesn't fold up neatly, so you have to kind of just wad it up.  It isn't cushioned, but if it were it would be huge, and I have enough issue trying to carry my son, a cart cover, my purse, and whatever else I might need.  Besides, he doesn't really need cushioning.  Even at 7 months, he's perfectly comfy on the thick bedspread-like fabric.

The Clean Shopper comes in a thick plastic bag (the sort of thing bedspreads or other linens come in) that zips closed.  It's a snug fit to get in there because of the wadded nature of the bundle, but it works fine.  The handle is short and taut, so isn't of much use.  A longer strap so it could be shoulder worn or hung on a stroller would be better.

The loops work well, and it's a relief to have a clean place my son can sit and play with anchored toys.  He can't throw the toys in the floor, and he stays entertained.

There are velcro tabs on the front that can be fastened around the front of a shopping cart or high chair.  This keeps it in place better.  The leg holes don't match up exactly with whatever he's sitting in, but it doesn't cause a problem.

My main problem with the Clean Shopper is that the belt strap does not attach to the seat.  It's a completely seperate piece.  Unless you are careful to snap the belt clips together, looping the belt around a part of the seat, you will end up losing the strap.  Somehow I've lost mine after only a few uses.  I kept it rolled up inside the thing when I removed it from a cart, and it probably fell out in a parking lot somewhere.  When handling a baby, your purse, whatever is in your cart (or trying to eat at a restaurant), it is very easy to overlook such a small item.

Since the website sells replacement straps, it seems they are aware of the issue.  It's a shame they don't have velcro tabs that stick it to the back of the shopper, making it harder to lose the strap.  I've ordered two replacements in black, so I can see the strap more clearly against my blue Clean Shopper.  I will also make certain I buckle the strap clips.

It's a good seat cover overall, definitely worth having.  Just be careful of the strap"

Those who say there is no cushioning, that's not really the purpose of the clean shopper!  It's purpose is to act as a buffer between you and the cart.

Other than that, this thing is wonderful!  My daughter was a summer baby, so we usually just used receiving blankets.  But we got this in the fall and were able to use it all winter and into the spring.  It kept her warm enough, even on the cold days.  I would probably suggest getting the heavier version for newborns in the winter, but this worked great for our older baby in the winter.  There's no need to worry about blankets or extra layers of clothes or snowsuits.  The Bundle Me Lite stays attached to the carseat, all you need to do is zip it up, and you're ready to go!

Also, I find the volume at the low setting very soothing and helps me fall asleep.  I've read the posts that mention the filters being hard to find.  However, they are very easy to find.  The evenflo filter is the SAME EXACT filter as the Holmes HWF62 filter which is available in many places since Holmes still manufactures humidifiers which require this filter.  I just purchased a ""colorcheck"" by Holmes filter from Walmart and I still have an original evenflo branded filter from last year.  I put them up to each other and they are the SAME EXACT dimensions.  Actually, I prefer the colorcheck over the original evenflo filter because I think it lasts longer before needing replacement.  If you look at the bottom of the evenflo humidifier box, it will say that this humidifier was manufactored by Holmes for evenflo.  Therefore, it would only make sense that a Holmes filter would be compatible with this unit"

There is no dampness or residue left after using this humidifer for a length of time because there is no vapor.  After buying others like this, that draws dry air in and releases cool and moist air, I was skeptical to spend the money on this one because I found the others not to work well at all!  When running this humidifier for the first time, I could actually notice a difference in the humidity level in my daughter's room after running it for about an hour.  This did not happen with the others.  Yes, it is a loud unit but you get used to it and it does a great job of draining out all of the other noise in the home for my toddler while she is sleeping.  I have never had a problem with the filter or finding replacements, nor have I had a problem with my toddler taking it apart.

I registered for this item and received it at my shower. My son is 5 1/2 months old and was severly congested. I took the box out of his closet and set up the machine. After the first night (about 10 hours) he woke up for the first time in 2 weeks able to drink his bottle with out me using saline drops and an aspirator. I am continuing to use this product every night and every morning is much more pleasant. As for the noise level I do not find that to be an issue. I don't have a problem hearing my son cry or even move around on the monitor. I feel the noise is actually soothing for the child and helps fade out other noise in the house.

I love that the 5-point harness comes off the back so my son can sit forward in the seat.  The back lays all the way down, unlike my Graco.  The basket is a good size, but difficult to get things in and out of if the baby is laying down.  We have no trouble keeping the cup holder in the tray.

That was fine and dandy but the service rep was incredibly snotty and didn't want to take anytime to bother making sure it was the correct product would have rather just had me send it back. Bad for business I'd guess. Not to mention they do have a serious issue letting people know when items are out of stock. It was IN stock when we ordered and magically out of stock the day it was to be shipped, then when I went to cancel the order via phone (48 min on hold!!) they said oh it had already shipped they couldn't cancel the order.

But the best part about the pump, is that you can buy different-sized breastshields to use with it. I needed a larger one than what came standard with it. It makes pumping more comfortable. The first few times I used it, I considered switching to an electric pump because I wasn't pumping much milk. But the more I pumped, the more milk I produced. This breastpump is worth every penny.

Because of the temperature of the water, it causes condensation in the protective plastic bubble, so he can't see the mirror anyway, so what's the point in that one?  Nevertheless, he kinda looks at it in the middle of his bath and probably thinks, ""Hey, I was there a minute ago...""  He picks that one up, holds it up to his eye level, struggles to find himself for a second, laughs, and puts it back in the water and picks up another turtle.  Go figure.

It was extremely easy to use.  No, I didn't usually install it with one hand while holding my daughter (although I did a few times - it's not that hard); I normally parked near a cart, put the cover on & ran the belt through, THEN took my daughter out of her car seat & placed her in the shopping cart.  (Why carry your baby & heavy diaper bag through the parking lot if you don't need to! :-) ) 

It was a bit stiff to get into the stuff sack at first, but after one or two washings, it was a cinch to put it in the stuff sack when we were finished using it. 

It fit all the shopping carts we used, including the oversized ones at Costco.  It's held up well to repeated washings - a bit faded, but still looking fairly bright.

There was hardly a time that we went shopping that someone didn't come over & say ""Oh! I wish we'd had one of those when my children were small"".  Overall, we were very pleased with this product"

I loved these. I loved how simple it made it to store my milk. Straight from the Isis Pump to my fridge/freezer. Simple. Yes, the defrosting takes longer than some alternatives, but I always had a bottle in the fridge while one was defrosting. I found warming it in a boiling pot of water to work the best for quick defrost. They do take up more room than the bags when storing, but I think the convience outweighed that problem. I stored milk in the fridge and freezer and learned to rotate so room wasn't a terrible problem. (If you do this, it is important to label and date the containers) This also saved me from defrosting last minute. I had some leaking issues from time to time, but figured it out. If you tighten the container/bottle too much it will leak. Simple fix...don't over-tighten.

I can take this in and out of the car easily with one hand. I've never had an issue with the steering as others have stated.  There were some complaints about the harness.  It sounds to me that they just did not read the directions.  I use the 5 point harness everytime I put my daughter, now 20 months, in the stroller.  The harness is simple to use and is very secure.  The stroller hood is easy to keep clean/dry.  Any liquid that drops on the fabric just beads up, you can wipe or flick it off.

I even ran over this stroller with our minivan and it works as well as the day we bought it.  The snack tray bent, but that was the only dammage to stroller.  I was easily able to order a replacement.

The only complaint I have is the lousy adult cup holder hanging from one side of the handlebar.  It doesn't stay in place, and my water bottle slips out easily. I did see this stroller at Sea World last weekend.  I saw a Peg Aria with a tray and cup holder that extends to each side of the stroller just below the handlebar.   Check with Peg.

ANOTHER GREAT FEATURE is that there is a mechanism in this warmer that keeps the wipes pushed to the top so you never have to reach down in there to get wipes - a hard to find feature with warmers!  They do not brown and they are perfectly warm for about 10 seconds out of the warmer - plenty of time to wipe their bottoms off!  We HIGHLY recommend this warmer - it is THE BEST in our opinion as new parents"

Very good quality and the colors on it would go great in a lavendar or pink room.  We did our daughter's room in a dark pink at bottom with white chairrail, light pink above chairrail and white crown molding.  Add in the wall decorations and other accessories and its tooooo cute.

WON'T TRAVEL AGAIN WITHOUT IT!,"January 12, 2007",MOMofTHREE,"Colchester, CT USA","We just came back from vacation over the holidays and used the TOTEaTOT for the first time.  It was a lifesaver!  I purchased it right before we went away because I had been agonizing about how we were going to manage all the logistics of maneuvering through the airport with all of the gifts were were bringing along, plus our luggage and ourselves, without losing one of our kids in the process!  
 
It worked just as it promised.  It was easy to attach the suitcase to the car seat.  Our son was happy as a clam getting wheeled through the airport.  We could easily bring his car seat on the plane without having to lug it through the airport!  A car seat is a must-have on the airport for a happy child and happy neighboring passengers!  We were able to carry our gifts as carry-on because we didn't want to check them, and we brought a carry-on suitcase in case our other checked luggage was lost, we'd at least have the essentials for our little one and the rest of us.  
 
We had no problems with it at all.  It had pockets for us to store my son's bottle, and we were able to use the backpack portion of the TOTEaTOT to hold his diapers and some toys.  I read another review where they experienced an issue with a buckle, but we had no problem at all, and in fact, I was worried that we were perhaps over-weighing it because all the stuff we had hanging off our roller suitcase (besides just the TOTEaTOT, car seat and our son, like my handbag, and a laptop computer), but again, no problems at all.  Just lots of smiles and curious faces in the airport!  
 
I'd highly recommend it. "

I use the med/large ones on my 24 pound baby. She was able to fit into the small ones even until she was about 20 pounds. A close fit, but they fit. The med/ large ones are a better fit for her.

When you first get them the are thick and fluffy - so soft! After some washes (in Washing Soda and Borax) I found that mine aren't as soft, but they are still very nice. They are thick. My baby is a heavy wetter and rarely soaks all the way through these. 

The picture on this website makes it look like the front of the diaper isn't contoured, but it is. It is just not as wide in the front as in the back, as it should be. If you like you can just use these with a pin on either side and they'd work great without anything else, though there is no elastic to prevent leaks out the side and the outside would get damp. 

You also can't tell from the picture that there is a rectangular doubler sewn into the inside of these - with one line of stitching right down the center to hold it in place. It is the full length of the diaper. I think I would have rather had it stitched on both sides so one side wouldn't accidentally get folded over the wrong way, but then perhaps that would have caused bunching problems.

I use the Bummis Super Whisper Wrap diaper covers with these and they fit perfectly. 

I have no complaints. After numerous washings they haven't started to fall apart like some others do. I really like them"

1 Light weight
2 Mesh/breathable fabric for warm weather
3 Handles are tall enough for woman in heels, or husbands.
4 Nice colors
5 Easier to steer than other stollers. (can use 1 hand)
6 Folds flat and has carry handle

Bad:
1 Too light to put your bag or purse on the handles, will tip with no baby in it.
2 Doesn't recline
3 Sometimes the 5 point harness takes more effort to unclip

Overall, this is a good investment. Turns out most parents will end up using thier compact 'umbrella' stoller way more than the deluxe, super gadget stoller. It's so much easier to use these simple light weight strollers, than their bulky, wide, heavy counterparts."
B000BZ6BAM:the_only_stroller_you'll_keep:mamabear,B000BZ6BAM,Maclaren Volo Saffron Orange Stroller: Baby,baby,3 of 3,5.0,The Only Stroller You'll Keep,"September 8, 2006",MamaBear,"Jacksonville, Florida","When I was pregnant with my son I received one of those big, bulky strollers as a baby shower gift, but after my son grew out of the attaching car seat he quickly grew to hate the stroller - as did I.

After much research we bought the Maclaren Volo Carbon Stroller with mesh backing (we live in Florida so the mesh was perfect for our climate) and I am sure I will never own another stroller.  I remember cringing as I spent the $100 but we now joke that it was the best $100 we ever spent.  It really was.

We have traveled all over the country with the stroller - it's lightweight, extremely collapsable and comes with a shoulder strap that was a genious addition.  The wheels don't stick like cheaper umbrella strollers, it can take a beating and still keep going.  At 4 years and 42 lbs it still carried my son without a squeek. (Ok we did WD-40 the wheels once in the 4 years we had it.) The mesh backing made cleaning the stroller a breeze.  It can easily be steered with one hand, and we personally loved the shape of the handles and the handle padding  - pushing other strollers feels so awkward now.  The basket underneath is incredibly handy and carries a surprising amount.  It folds easily with one hand and foot.  

My son doesn't use a stroller anymore but the Volo still looks and works perfectly so we are saving it for our next child.  

Bottom line, this stroller is worth every penny you pay for it.

The ONE and only complaint I have about the stroller is that it would be nice if the seat reclined for younger infants.  If you are thinking about purchasing this stroller for younger infants consider spending the extra $ for the model that does recline.  A sun visor might be something to consider too"

I'd keep everything else about it the same, and I would definitely recommend this stroller for someone who travels with her child as much as I do (once a month at least)"

Here is a copy of my communication to them:

""I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for making such a superior product.  As a mother to a 2 Â½ year old and an 11 week old, I own several thermometers and performed my fair share of temperature readings.  A few months ago I purchased your QuickRead digital thermometer to keep in my diaper bag as a spare.  After using the product a few times, I have decided to replace all other thermometers I own with more QuickReads.  From end to end, what a great product!  Here is what I love about it:
- Extremely quick readings
- The shape of the tip allows for perfect insertion
- Tip is also flexible, allowing for ""wiggle room""
- Button is the perfect size and easy to trigger
- Most importantly, the readout faces the reader - not the tush it's reading!

A digital thermometer is a parent's necessity.  Unfortunately, the only way to find out which one works best is by trial and error.  I am so glad I finally what I consider to be the best one on the market, and I thought I'd let you know what a good job your company has done."""

Only when she could finally get up and crawl did she tire of the mat. 
My only criticism is of the ""musical"" toy that dangles. It does have a switch on/off which is great. However, the volume of the music is LOUD! Many a dark night I tried to tiptoe past it and had a heart attack when I accidentally tapped the toy & the music blasted. ALso, the sun-mirror comes off easily and is hard to prop up.

I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep, then put her in her crib... and she'd flail her arms, wake up and cry, and I had to start all over! What a nightmare! 

Then I figured out that since her arms wake her, it would make sense to wrap her in something so she couldn't move them as much... so I started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets. It worked! It became much easier to get her to sleep. But then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again. 

When she was a little over a month old, somehow I came across SwaddleMe blankets on the Internet and immediately bought it. It worked great! It was so easy to wrap my daughter in it, and it stayed put. My daughter started sleeping so much better! 

I wish I found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me from so many sleepless nights! 

2 years later, my son was born, and thankfully I already knew about those blankets from the start. He goes to sleep great in the SwaddleMe blanket! Out of curiosity, I tried to put him to sleep without this blanket, and his arms wake him right away - exactly the same as my daughter! 

I consider this blanket one of the most important baby items you could buy. It should be a must for a new mother who wants to get some sleep"

We started off using just the receiving blanket but as she got bigger she would escape from it or kick her legs free and it would end up like a donut around her waist by morning. She still at 4 months sleeps better with her arms restrained so we have continued swaddling and the SwaddleMe is perfect for that. It's very easy to get her into but doesn't constrict her legs as much as the blanket used to.
My only complaint with the product is that there needs to be a large area for the velcro bears to attach to. To wrap it tight enough to hold her arms leaves the bottom bear with nothing to attach to. She may just be on the smaller side for this Large version but she had definately outgrown the Small one because she could no longer straighten her legs in it"

The Diaper Genie was so hard to use and didn't do anything to stop odors. My son's room smelled as if we threw the diapers in an open garbage. We replaced it with THE FIRST YEARS CLEAN AIR DIAPER DISPOSAL SYSTEM. It's awesome!

The greatest thing about it is that it can store about 6-7 days of my son's diapers without NO yucky odors. WOW!! It has a ""clean air"" venting system which is totally 100% silent. I actually though it was broken because it made NO noise! It runs on D batteries that last about 9 months. There is a little light that briefly flashes to let you know that the lid is secure and the vent system is working. It uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags--saving us money. 

The only drawback is that occasionally you will shut the lid and it won't fully secure. You'd know that by two clues, the first being that the little green light won't flash. Later you'll get the second clue--your baby's room will start to smell! I now check to see if the light is on each time I put a diaper in to make sure the lid is secure.

We love this product so much. Our son's room smells clean with no poopy odors, and we save money by using our own tall kitchen bags. It's also very easy to change--no confusing bag twisting.

I highly recommend using this diaper holder, it's the best"

My daugther made it clear very early that she preferred me to a bottle and refused all bottles and pacifiers. She does know how to use a sippy, and will take one no problem. Recently, I pumped some milk to take with her when her grandmother was going to watch her for me. This is the first time I had pumped since she was really little, and I had gotten rid of all the bottles that fit the pump, besides these. I had meant to give them to my sister but forgot about having them. I pumped into the bottle to take with, and Mom transferred it to a sippy there. When it was time to go home, there was still a lot left and it was transferred back to the bottle to come home. It was placed in the fridge and I had planned on giving it to my older daughter today so it wouldn't go to waste. When I went to get it, I could't find it and I discovered Kathrynn sucking away at it. She had almost totally finished the three ounces. One of her siblings had decided to be helpful by giving her the bottle and an oatmeal cookie. I was floored seeing her actually using a bottle. And it wasn't because she was desperate. It hadn't been that long since she had nursed. 

She absolutely loves this bottle. I tried again later with a bit of pear juice and she took it no problem although she pushed away any other nipples I handed to her. I had no problems with this leaking. I'll still stick with sippys. I have more of those, and it just seems silly to go buy a bunch of bottles and nipples when I would be taking her off bottles in four months anyway. But I definitely recomend them. My sisters little guy really likes them too, which is why I had meant to give them to her. These are the only bottles she uses, and she does use formula."

The lactation consultant suggested the Soothie products to improve my daughter's latch because of the long round nipple shape that's more natural for nursing babies.  It's too soon to see if it made a difference, but my daughter LOVES the soothie bottles and paci's now!  It took weeks before she'd take a Mam and over a week before she'd successfully drink from a Gerber bottle, but she took to Soothies instantly and in 5 mins or less prefered them to the products she'd been using for months!  They're so much easier for her to suck and hold in her mouth.  The price is great too, about 1/2 the price of the same set with Avent products.  

My 2 complaints are: 1) the leaking bottles and 2) the pacifier looks weird and doesn't attach to a pacifier keeper.  The leaking can be fixed by getting the part where the rim of the bottle meets the nipple wet to create a full seal.  Also, it helps to ""swirl"" the formula to mix instead of ""shaking"" it... it takes a bit longer, but you end up with less mess and less bubbles"

The slipcover that comes with it is very pretty and easy to take off to wash. It also comes with a zippable pillowcase that you can fold the whole thing into to make one nice round pillow.

Here's why we're keeping this one forever, or at least until our kids are done having kids: &#60;br /&#62;
&#60;br /&#62;
1. It's sturdy--no balancing needed.&#60;br /&#62;
2. Also, one-piece construction means no chasing pee out of crevices or finding it in surprising places. We empty, wipe with TP, and wipe with a Clorox wipe.&#60;br /&#62;
3. Facilitates a modified squat position, which makes pooping easier. (Success = compliance!)&#60;br /&#62;
4. Got a boy? Your walls will thank you. This design is more effective than splash guards or turning Junior backwards on the Big Seat.&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;br /&#62;
Note: We also have the one-piece Baby Bjorn model. It's smaller, so it works well at Grandma's house"

The directions were easy to follow, all the parts were included, and we had it up in about an hour.  (Even for two old grandparents.)

DeJong,"Tri-Cities, WA  USA","     I searched online for sage colored crib bedding for weeks before my daughter was born and finally settled on something close. I was satisfied that it matched well enough to maintain the cuteness of her nursery (of utmost importance) and was affordable at the same time. I had seen the breathable bumpers but opted for the ""cuter"" bedding, confident that my child would be safe.
     
My daughter started sleeping through the night at 8 weeks which meant I was not going into her room for 7-9 hours at a time, depending on the night.  Even though I swaddle her for sleeping, she still manages to travel around her crib during the night as well as during longer naps.
     
One morning when I heard her wake up, I went into her room to find that she had wiggled her way down to the southwest corner of her crib and her face was pressed up against the ""adorable, nursery-matching, affordable"" crib bumper.  I jerked that bumper out of the bed and ran down to order a breathable bumper.  
    
Since I put it on her crib she has been pressed up against it two or three times and is able to breath.  I am delighted because I think it's actually cuter than the one I had before and I don't have to worry at all (at least about that!).  It's a very clean look and the green gingham matches the crib skirt I got perfectly.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the fit.  It comes in 2 pieces:  one for the side of the crib that moves up and down and one for the other 3 sides.  This leaves 2 openings, one at each end of the front of the crib, that an arm or leg could potentially get stuck in.  It hasn't been a problem for us yet as she has quit the southwest travelling and now just spins in place. However, I would much rather risk a let getting stuck than having a suffocated baby.  I have no regrets about buying this and am advising all of my pregnant friends to consider the breathable option over the puffy ones"

This crib is so much more attractive than pack-n-plays but functional and lasts so much longer than other cradles or bassinettes.  One of the biggest advantages is that it fits through doorways, which the pack-n-play does not, and I had wanted something I could roll around from room to room.  This was useful when she was a newborn and we wanted to keep her in the room with us, or just push her to the next room where we could hear her.  I also plan to use it to roll around the house when she is older and is using it to play in.  The nice thing about it is that it works just like a regular crib with the side that lowers and the mattress level which has two settings.  The other reviewer is right, you can push it up to your bed if you want a co-sleeper type of bed, and you could even lower the side down for easy reach of the baby.   I have not used it this way but it would be the perfect thing if my baby got sick.  Tho other thing I love about this crib is that as a sleeper or play area, it lasts much longer than a bassinnett or cradle - as long as a pack n play- I believe up to 50 pounds.  Finally, it is really nice looking, and since we have it in our master bedroom, I wanted something that would be cute and not bulky or would stand out too much.  This one is really attractive.  Negatives:  The mattress is pretty wimpy, which is why I gave this 4 stars.  But she, at just 6 months, is still sleeping on it at night and seems to be very comfortable in it.  For the next baby, I will probably look around for another mattress.  The other negative is that the crib does not travel too well - unlike the pack-n-play.  It does fold up for easy storage, but unless you have a minivan or SUV, it is still pretty large to store in a trunk - it does not fit into our volvo 4-door car trunk.  I would also recommend buying one of the port-a-crib bumper pad sets (around 40-50.00) from Babies R Us because they fit this crib the best.  I bought the 15.00 Koala Kids bumper pad and it is too big and buckles around the bed, so I only recently started using the bumper pad for fear that she would press up against it at night.  But you need a bumper pad with the crib as they get older because they start sticking their legs and arms out the slats while asleep.  Nice crib - good choice.    "

Very easy to put together especially at 8 1/2 months pregnant. I love that it reclines and the height is adjustable. It's on wheels which makes it easy to manuever throughout the house and it folds up very easily which makes it easy to store out of the way while not in use. Everything seems to be great about this chair. Our daughter won't be using it for a few months since she isn't even here yet but I'm sure she'll love it as much as I do already

I would have given five stars but to unfold/fold it you need two hands which sometimes isn't too ""handy"" when you have a crying baby in one of the them.  The seat adjusts up and down so your child can sit right at the table with you.  As stated above, the legs fold together so you can store the chair when not using.  The chair cover is also easy to take off when it needs to be cleaned(which we do in the tub) and is attached with snaps.  My little one is ten months old, 19 pounds, 27.5 inches and not even close to outgrowing this chair.  I definitely recommend this chair.  Hope this helps!"
"B000CENF3I:overall_really_great,_only_1_big_con:a._thompson",B000CENF3I,Baby Trend Baby Trend Flex Lock Car Seat Galaxy: Baby,baby,1 of 1,4.0,"Overall really great, only 1 big con","April 9, 2007",A. Thompson,"Salt Lake City, Utah","I have had two kids use my Evenflo carseat.  I HATED it. It was like they never even tried it out to see how well its features worked.  I finally got so sick of it when my 2nd child was 4 months old that I ordered a Babytrend Flexloc.  At first I was seduced by the high safety ratings, but even after that Consumer Reports article was rescinded, I still liked a lot of the features.

Pros:
-very comfy seat, good padding 
-the canopy is twice as long as my Evenflo so it can cover baby almost completely
- the canopy stays in place; it doesn't fall forward or backward behind the seat
- the tightening mechanism under the baby's feet is easy to reach and VERY easy to adjust to make the straps tighter or looser depending on what baby is wearing
- the harness mechanism is very easy to adjust (the shoulder strap height). My Evenflo had to be rethreaded every few months and even my mechanically inclined husband said it was horrible.  The Flexloc is just a dial on the back that you turn--it's a breeze.
- The seat can be transfered between cars without the base.  It can be strapped directly to the car by using a seat belt on the car seat or by using the LATCH system if your car has it.
- the triangular handle has a nice grip and is easy to hold in any position
- this carseat is lighter than my Evenflo
- The cloth is very wipeable, not as absorbant of spills and stains as my Evenflo


Cons:
I found a few minor cons that definitely would not deter me from buying this carseat, and one that might (depending on how I can resolve it once I contact Babytrend).
- The release button to take the seat off its base is at the toes under the seat.  It's a little harder to reach than the ones behind the head if the carseat is backward facing.
- As others have said, the buttons to move the handle are a bit stiff, but not horribly so.  I was prepared for them to be way worse.
- The handle is thinner and doesn't FEEL as sturdy as my Evenflo when carrying baby around, but it hasn't had any problems
-This is the one BIG one that I have to check with Babytrend on:  Twice when I have turned a corner sharply, the carseat has tipped to a 45 degree angle!  I have tightened down the seatbelt as much as I could, putting my full weight on it and using the seatbelt retracting mechanism.  But maybe I'm still not doing it right.  The base is narrower than my Evenflo's was, so maybe that's why?  So I need to contact Babytrend and see if they have any suggestions.  Until then, I guess I'll take the corners slower!

Overall, I have felt like this seat was a MAJOR improvement over my Evenflo and even over the Graco Snugrides I checked out at the store.  It was intelligently designed to be easy to use and adjust as baby grows. I would recommend it for sure.  Just make sure you strap it in tightly or use the LATCH system if you have it"

We NEVER leave him unattended in his jumper and we've had no problems. For the first week or so he just kind of hung around in it, moving around in circles. He's finally gotten the hang of jumping and he also realizes that he's the one controlling all of the sounds. The only drawbacks I see with it, and the reason I can only give 4 out of 5 stars, is that the volume setting goes from loud to EXTREMELY loud. I wish there was one more quieter setting. Also, as with any doorway jumper, there IS a bit more potential for injury than with stationary jumpers. But as I said before, if you monitor your child, said child should be fine.

Anymore than that and I recommend an Exersaucer. I mean, how long can you just jump before it gets boring. Just put the jumper in a wide doorway and you won't have the problem of the baby hitting their hand against to doorway or whatever people complained about. And for god's sake, when your kid is over like 20 pounds move on to something else. All it all, I think this was a great investment"

I did a ton of research before we bought this one and I can say I am very pleased with it.  The straps are really easy to use and do not tangle, it tighten with a pull of the strap in the front.  Getting it in and out of the car is also pretty easy.  All you have to do is grab the handle on the back of the seat and lift up.  To get it in the car you simply place it in the base and listen for a couple of clicks to make sure it is in securely.

The only things I have found that bother me is that the baby seems to have a hot and sweaty back whenever I take him out.  The material doesn't seem to breathe very well.  Also, I have had a few grocery carts that it has not fit into.  I found that if I lowered the handle bar all the way back I could sometimes make it work.  Worst case, I just place it in the large part of the cart sideways.  

I have the Peg Perego Pliko P3 stroller and it fits into it perfectly.

Be sure to have the installation of the car seat checked.  We thought we had it in our car correctly and when we brought it to the police station to have it checked, they showed us it was in wrong. "

I chose to order this item for her birthday during a free shipping promotion after seeing the poor choices of play food offered in my local toy stores.  It's disappointing that most play food available is fast-food branded (i.e. McDonalds)!  Even the ""knock-off"" tubs of play food are primarily junk food - hot dogs, donuts, cupcakes, ice cream cones, etc.  I chose this set because it consists of the foods my daughter primarily eats - fruits and vegetables, eggs, cheese, bread, etc.  

Some of the pieces are solid plasic, and some are hollow, which leaves a greater question of durability.  But even the hollow pieces are made of a very thick, rather ridged plastic which I think will stand up OK over time.  I am not even able to squeeze them myself.  I also like that the foods are on the small side and actually fit in the small pots and pans sets available right now (although we set aside a few questionably small things, like the carrots and mushrooms, until she is older).

My husband and I both use it, and it works great on our 3 year old boy.  (The beeping of the thermometer makes him giggle, even when he's sick.)  

As far as the probe covers go, we've found that it works just fine without them.  We use rubbing alcohol to clean off the probe tip in between uses, just as we always did with the old-school mercury thermometers our parents had when we were growing up.  Yes, the instruction book for this ear thermometer says that the probe covers help ensure accuracy, but we haven't found that to be a problem.  Keep in mind that this thermometer is ONLY for use with babies OVER 6 months old because the ear canals of newborns aren't large enough to accomodate an ear thermometer.  Exceptionally accurate temperature measurements are very important for newborns (so use a different type of thermometer - not an ear thermometer), but usually all we really need for older babies, children and adults is a measure of ""normal"", ""a little above normal"", or ""significantly above normal.""  In my opinion, if the temperature is over 101, you ought to be calling your pediatrician anyway.

If the probe covers really do matter to you, pull out that instruction manual and READ IT.  It specifies that you can use any brand of probe covers and recommends a particular model number of Walgreens brand covers.  In my opinion, The First Years company is being VERY helpful with regard to the probe covers - the instruction manual does not say ""You must buy ONLY our brand of probe covers.""  Instead, they make it clear that just about any brand will work (as long as the style is similar) and even specify a brand that is readily available from a particular national drugstore chain.

The factor that DOES significantly affect accuracy is how you hold the thermometer and the ear.  The instruction manual includes both descriptions and diagrams that show how to hold the child's (or adult's) ear and insert the probe tip.  It's VERY important that you use the right ""ear-holding technique"".  For smaller babies, you pull the back of the ear STRAIGHT BACK and hold it while inserting the probe tip.  But for older children and adults, you pull the top of the ear UP and hold it while inserting the probe tip.  When I neglect to hold the ear in the proper position, I always get inaccurate results.  (I know for a fact that my normal temperature is not 95 degrees, but that's what it reads if I hold my ear incorrectly.)  When I hold the ear in the correct position (depending on the age and size of the person whose temperature I'm taking), I get very accurate results.  

My guess is that the people who have complained about the accuracy of this thermometer did not read the instructions, because the diagrams in the manual show you quite clearly how to hold the ear and thermometer.  Also, some of the reviewers mentioned getting inaccurate results on their young babies (e.g., 3 months old).  Remember - this thermometer is NOT for babies under 6 months.  It's not intended to be used for newborns, so you shouldn't expect accurate results when you use it on a newborn.  Plus, I can't imagine trying to stick the probe tip into the ear of a newborn.  That would hurt!

So, my bottom line is that this is a GREAT thermometer, as long as you use it properly.  And, the probe covers really aren't a big deal.  Get well soon!  :"

It is so easy.  Just be sure to hold the top of the ear straight up then insert the probe, this should give you the right angle.  As for the probe covers, you can use any generic cover.

I originally had this same type bathseat for my son, minus the little elbow rest, but when trying to purchase the same one 7 years later I see that it is no longer available.  The great thing about the other one was that when putting your child into it, the front would rise up and snap shut.  With the Safety 1st Tubside Bathseat, you have to slide your kid into it.  

Also, be very careful if you have a ""climber"".  My daughter loves to try standing in it.  Fortunately, the elbow rest makes it secure, so there are no fears of the seat tipping over, just your little standing monkey.  You will still have to remove your child in order to wash their little bottoms"

Finley,"Seoul, South Korea","My baby loved this car seat from the start.  We've used it through all stages, including rear-facing, and now forward facing with my currently 19 month old toddler.  The seat is easy to adjust as baby grows, and easy to install using the Latch system.  The removable infant padding was perfect.  Biggest bonus is the adjustable crotch strap with padded cover shield to prevent chafing and scratching between baby's legs.  I'm due with my next baby in a month and have already added a second one of these to my baby registry.  A wonderful car seat...you will not be disappointed.  (Note that this seat is quite heavy, and best for permanent installation in a single car.  I would not recommend it for repeated swithching to other cars because of it's weight."

Barber ""Nor Cal Mama""","California, USA","It took me several weeks before I finally opted to purchase the Decathlon rather than the Boulevard.  I was very interested in the extra side-impact protection that is only available in the Boulevard model but was concerned about whether or not my large 4&1/2 month old son (who is in the 95th percentile in length and weight) would need the adjustable crotch strap positioning that is only offered on the Decathlon.  

I am so glad that I purchased the Decathlon!  It turns out that my son DID indeed need to have the crotch strap adjusted to the last slot (he would be sitting on top of the buckle in the Boulevard at this point which would have made it impossible to buckle and very uncomfortable for him).  If you're purchasing for a thin toddler rather than an infant or chubby/big baby you might not have to worry about that. 

I love the extra padding (which is removable, unlike the pads in the Boulevard) and the soft cover (which is machine washable unlike that in the Boulevard). He seems to be VERY comfortable and I know that he is safe.  I know that it doesn't offer as much side-impact protection as the Boulevard, but it does offer some (definitely much more than a conventional car seat) as it is made to far exceed American safety standards. Plus, if your baby is placed in the middle of the back seat than that offers some additional protection as well.

I was also concerned about the size of the car seat and whether or not it would fit comfortably, rear-facing, in the back of my Toyota Avalon car. It does. Perfectly! My husband is 6'4"" and doesn't have to move his seat up to accomodate the car seat in back (something I was very concerned about). AND I can see out of the rear-view mirror with no problem. It DOES NOT block your view at all.

It's very easy to install and, if done so properly, doesn't budge. It is a little tough to adjust the straps when it's installed rear-facing but not too difficult... and even if you had to take it out to adjust the straps it's no-biggy because the carseat takes only a couple moments to install EASILY and it's not like you'll have to adjust them on a daily basis or anything. 

I am very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend the Decathlon to anyone looking for a SAFE, COMFY and ATTRACTIVE carseat that will take them from the chubby baby stage all the way through the toddler years. :o)"

I have a two-year-old son and a five-month-old daughter and both kids like facing forward. I also like the side-by-side style. I couldn't see myself pushing a ""stretch limo"" as I've heard it called. It's easy to maneuver, I can fit down most aisles, and it fits in the trunk of my compact car with a full load of groceries. Drawbacks: the canopy could be a bit higher, (my son thinks it's a game when I pull it forward and immediately pushes it back), the seat covers are velcroed in place and tend to slip when I put the kids in, and I need to fold it before it will fit through the front door of the house. I've also taken it on two cross-country plane trips with layovers. Baggage handlers in general aren't very gentle and the front bars come off fairly easily when the stroller is folded. One now has a small rip in it, but I'm lucky it didn't get lost. Overall, I've been happy with it"

The only reason I got this to begin with was because when I removed the old traditional fluffy cotton bumper pads, which I realized weren't safe, my 4 month old would squirm around, and his legs or an arm would end up sticking out of the slats and he would get stuck. So I realized I needed something to block the slats. I was happy to find this new breathable bumper to keep his arms and legs in the crib. My only concern was whether or not I'd be able to easily change the crib sheet once this was installed. And I can! My husband secured this bumper (velcro pads) extremely tight all the way around. Spend the few extra minutes to do that (it takes 2 people) and then you will not have to remove the bumper to get the sheets off! I can even completely pull the mattress out of the crib to get the sheets off easier if I need to, and the bumper stays in place since it fits so snugly against the sides of the crib. It's almost like it's not even there. I HIGHLY recommend this product"

She didn't care for the stroller and who would?  With the hip hammock she was carried around, able to see everything at eye level (instead of looking at everyone's knees) was close to mommy (or daddy) and got cuddled constantly.  I would walk the mall for hours with her in there, She slept in it and I could sit down with her in it and rest or even feed her.   I loved that I never needed to take it off, but even when I did it's so simple!  

The trick to getting it to fit well is to make sure the waist strap is very snug and the child should be slightly in front of your hip, not actually on the side.  I put my girl in, make sure she's evenly positioned in the middle of the ""seat"" and then pull her closely to me  while adjusting the shoulder strap.  You do have to pull it nice and tight, but not so tight that it rides up on your neck. I recommend trying it at home at first and getting it just how you like it-then only undo the front strap to take it off.  Otherwise you will have to pull at front and back when you're ""out"" and that's difficult.  I found the best positioning for baby and mom is to have the baby's back arm under the mother's arm which is then draped over the child's back and can then easily ""hold"" the bottom of the hammock or just hang free.  I found that I didn't actually have to ""hold"" my daughter while she was in the hammock.    

My big complaint is that the strap gets twisted in the padding and eventually there is no fixing it.  I wish they would put a non slip gripper on the bottom of the strap so it doesn't slip toward your neck.  I think this would fix the bunching of the padding that happens.  

However, I loved this thing so much that I'm just going to buy a new one for my second child.   I know I will get my money's worth!  It saves my back and shoulders.  I have tried the front carriers and just can't stand to have them on for more than 15 minutes.  [...] "

Because of the seat styling in the Civic I had to put rolled up towels under the sides of the base to stabilize it but I had that problem with the infant seat. The belts are easy to fasten and very easy to adjust since it has a button to push for slack and a strap you pull to tighten. We are happy with the seat and would buy another if we needed it, [..."

(I purchased it in the Cobblestone design) It's wonderfully made convertible car seat, and a much better value as the higher-priced alternative car seats. We had a Britax before purchasing this one, and I think I'll definitely stick with Evenflo! This is one the best-rated car seats, and less than HALF the price of Britax! 

It's super sturdy, great safety features, everything you'd want in a great car seat. It is a little bigger than I expected, and had trouble getting it in my car, but we used to have an infant car seat so I didn't keep that in mind that it'd be bigger because the baby's bigger! 

Also, for first-time parents, I would DEFINITELY recommend getting a convertible car seat instead of an infant car seat. Infant car seats are only a maximum of 22 lbs, and the baby will usually reach that by about 7 months! I paid $200 for the infant seat, and hardly got any use out of it! And convertible ones will go until the child reaches 40 lbs. A MUCH smarter and more economical choice."

","August 8, 2006",George,,"I wanted to write a review for this seat, because after much researching, I couldn't really find any helpful information.  I have a Britax Blvd. for my 15 month old daughter in my Honda minivan, which she is very happy with, but it couldn't fit in my husband's Dodge Ram 2500 truck.  It was too tall and would leave her in too much of an upright position.  After looking at the back's of a lot of other car seats, I felt this on would be a good fit without losing too much of the comfort for my daughter.  It fits very nicely in the extra cab and my daughter seems very comfortable.  It is very easy to install and it's very lightweight.  After lugging the Britax seat all over the airport and on and off the plane on a recent trip, I will be looking forward to traveling with this one instead.  The straps do not come with any covers, but that is an easy fix.  Adjusting the straps to fit her was very easy and there are multiple options to move them as she grows.  Overall, I think it will be a great seat to have as an extra.  The Britax will still be her main car seat; I don't think you can find a better seat than that one.   

If you need a seat to fit in the back of a truck, this is a good one"

I decided to buy the Titan because it also had good safety ratings and was lighter than the Triumph.  As a second seat, we wanted something more lightweight and portable since it would be moved between my husband's car and grandparents' cars.  

It's very easy to use, equally as comfortable as the Triumph, but slightly less plush.  I find the more simplistic harness adjustment much less of a struggle with the Titan.  That was my husband's #1 complaint about the expensive Triumph.

Barnum,"Seattle, WA","Our daughter has been in this seat since she was 7 months old. It is FANTASTIC!!! She is now 3 1/2 and I recently invested another $50 into the seat. I replaced the harness and the HUGS and was fortunate to find a new cover on clearance in a children's shop in Seattle. It now looks like brand new! We use it in a 2001 Toyota Tacoma double cab, a 1996 Chevy Suburban, and a 2003 BMW X5. In the Toyota and the BMW to get proper fit we have to remove the head rests. NO PROBLEM! As for the wieght, I am ok with having to lug a heavy seat if it means my child is as best protected as she can be. When you get the seat into whatever car you want it in, my recommendation is to literally climb into the seat with one knee pushing as much of your weight into the seat as possible. We do this when installing ours and it doesn't move a millimeter...... Our daughter is always comfortable in the big cushy seat, doesn't slump when she falls asleep, can't escape from it, and I never deal with twisted straps! Well worth the money, the *inconvenience* of the weight and size. Crazy that people would spend the money on this knowing it is the safest seat and then just because it is heavy put your child in a piece of junk in another car. An accident is only going to happen in the car with the best seat?? Think again!! Take the time to do it right!

He can finally sit up like a big boy the way he wants to now that he is 5 months old and is a supported sitter.  I like the fact that I can recline him if he falls asleep, which is usually the case in the car. I am sure he also appreciates the incredibly soft fabric - I know I would like to sit in a seat that soft.  Considering we travel 4-6 hours to visit grandparents, his comfort and happiness is very important to us in a carseat.

My baby was getting uncomfortable being swaddled at about three months, so we decided to make the switch to sleep sacks. We were worried that with her arms free that she might have a hard time falling and/or staying asleep. This was true at first so we started by only putting her in these during the daytime - in a light cotton one. After about a week she was not waking early from her naps anymore and after two weeks we tried her in it at night - and she slept straight through the night (as she did when she was swaddled). So the transition was painless and she seemed a much happier baby to be able to reach her hands and move her arms.

While I didn't notice shrinkage I did notice that the zipper does bunch up a bit, but this hasn't been a problem. Sometimes my daughter sucks on it if it gets close to her mouth, but she has to reach for it - it doesn't cover her face at all or trap air that she could rebreathe. 

I didn't like that these don't have sleeves so I tried Carter's sleep sacks and found the sleeves to be too short and hard to get on my daughter. Those sacks only come in one size which my daughter has already outgrown at four months (14 lbs, 24 inches). She has also outgrown the small size sleep sack, but the medium size fits her perfectly with some room to grow.

I didn't want to use fleece at first since it is polyester. I wanted to use cotton. But we've found that she sleeps longer and seems to prefer he heavier fabric of the fleece one.

Also, we only bought these in blue even though we have a girl because the color is calming to our easily overstimulated baby. 

We've washed these many times and they look just as good and hold together just as well as they did originally. 

We've also found you can put your baby into the next larger size without it being so big that they can get their arms out or that it bunches up around their face. So after everything we've tried we've loved these sleep sacks from day one"

Little did I know, I would come to LOVE the SleepSack for it's warming capabilities. After a few months under their belt, babies get VERY squirmy in the middle of the night, so blankets are useless (and dangerous).  So I relied heavily on the SleepSacks to keep my little guy warm, even after the risk of SIDS passed. They come in fleece for winter months and cotton for warmer months, and they're generous in size, so they are not outgrown easily. I only wish I'd purchased them in yellow or white, in case my next baby is the opposite sex"

After about two weeks our son started wiggling and could wiggle all the way to the bottom where there were no side protectors and he could fall out.

Mitchell,,"I've been using these to store milk for 6 months now, and I LOVE them. (I use the 8  oz size) They stack together so they don't take up too much room in my bag in the morning. (I work 12 hour shifts 3 days a week-so need to take several every day) And they sit upright so they don't leak in my cooler or in the refrigerator at work (and avoids the gross-out factor with co-workers that the bags can have) I recently bought the adaptors to pump directly into them, and love them even more. Also, my husband has to handle the milk when I am at work, and these are way easier for him than the bags, so he wastes less milk to spilling, etc. My only comment is that you do have to be careful not to overfill them, as breast milk expands when it freezes, and can pop off the lid or crack the container. But this would be a concern with ANY storage container, bags included. Hate the way breast milk storage bags leak when they are thawing out, and no matter how flat you try to freeze them, they never stack up well, so you end up with an avalanche of bags falling out of the freezer. I love that these containers are sturdy plastic that can stack up in the freezer, and they don't require special handling to thaw to avoid contaiminating the milk. As to buying the bases and lids separately, the containers are not meant to be used more than three times before they are discarded, while the lids hold up much longer, so I'm glad I can only buy what I need at a time, so no wasted money or extra supplies to store. As to cost, other similar containers cost $3-4 each, so $15 for 10 lids and bases seems very reasonable"

Before I dared buy any kind of car seat for my daughter again I made sure that I read over every parent review I could find(So I thank those who have reviewed this before me, they were a big help). I found a few complaints that I had about about this carseat myself after testing it out in the stores. I'll post a few possible solutions that I've found. 

Complaint #1: It's too big to fit on top of shopping carts. 
   I don't like it, but apparrently you're not even supposed to put carseat/carriers on shopping carts. It throws off the balance of the cart and can cause the cart to tip over super easy from what I've heard. I think Graco actually makes them so that they don't fit for that reason.

Complaint #2: The metallic or nylon-like fabric is uncomfortable for baby
   My daughter hated the metallic and nylon fabric when I tried her into them in the store so we bought a pattern that didn't have it(Central Park). You can check gracobaby.com to see other patterns that don't have it. Thats where we found ours.

Complaint #3: The waist of the belts are at an angle leaving marks on the babys' thighs.
   My daughter got marks the first time she wore a sunsuit in it but now I just pull the dress part down between her skin and the belts. The angle though is so that the waist belts will sit at the pelvis(or as close as possible on a newborn), which is the safest and the ideal place for them to sit on the baby.

Complant #4: Its' too big to fit most cars
   I thought for sure it wouldn't fit in our car especially because our Snug Ride barely squeezed in the backseat. But oddly enough this thing fits better into our old beat up 1992 Chevy Lumina(the sedan not the minivan)than the snug ride did. And if you've ever seen those old cars you'd know that when the front seat(s) are pushed all the way back there's pretty much no room for ANY kind of rear facing carseat. With the Infant Safe Seat installed PROPERLY my husband can still put the front seats all the way back. And this thing still fits into cars better than ANY convertible carseat. Before deciding on the infant safe seat I had tried the Graco, Evenflo, Britax, and Eddie Bauer convertible seats into the car.

Complaint #5: It's heavy and bulky.
   It is bulky, but how else could it accomadate the higher weight and height limit. As for being heavy Graco says it only weighs 5 pounds more than the old(20lb, 26"")Snug Ride. In Babies 'R' Us I tried holding our old snug ride(26"",20lbs) and the infant safe seat in both hands to compare the weight and even switched hands, but couldn't tell a difference. I also tried my daughter in it and carried her around the store. I think because of the size it makes it easier to carry the bigger/heavier babies, because my 18lb 27"" daughter is a lot more difficult to carry in her now out-grown snug ride. And I like that even once I no longer carry her around in it I'll still have the convenience of a travel system beyond the first year if my daughter's sleeping. That's something that no other carrier (or convertible carseat) can offer.

Complaint #6: It doesn't fit in the over-turned wooden highchairs
   I made it a point to try the carrier in restauraunt high chairs when i got it. I have tried it at 4 different restauraunts and have not had any more trouble than i did with the snug ride. So far from what I've seen they've fit perfectly.

Complaint #7: The stroller that matches the carseat is quite large
   Most of the patterns only offer a Quattro Tour stroller to match it, however the 3 nicest patterns/models, Samba, G Collection, and Central Park also offer a matching MetroLite stroller, and the Fusion patter also offers a matching Mosaic stroller, however the Pierson pattern ONLY offers a matching Mosaic stroller. The Quattro Tour stroller is a FULL SIZE stroller so it is heavier, bulkier, and has more nifty features, than the MetroLite and Mosaic stollers. So keep that in mind when choosing a stroller.

Complaint #8: It's too big for newborns.
   The 3 nicest patterns/models of the infant safe seats come with infant head&body support, though it isn't the greatest and if it doesn't work for your baby then you can just buy the Kiddopottomus Snuzzler infant head&body support. It's actually reversible and made out of that super soft velboa material on one side and the other is soft woven fabric. I had to buy one for my daughter when she was born because she was only 6lbs 12.5oz. She was so small even her snug ride looked like it swallowed her up when I buckled her into it. I've actually seen other reviews recommending the Snuzzler for the newborns who're going in an infant safe seat.

Complaint #9: The head support that the carrier comes with doesn't work
   You even have to buy separate (double)head supports for the snug rides (even the ones that come with a single one) unless you buy one of the nicest snug ride models that comes with double head supports. The head support that comes with most Infant Safe Seats is made more for older napping babies. I recommend the Especially for Baby Double head supports if you don't get the Snuzzler because they're made of 100% jersey knit cotton, the back of the head supports are slightly padded, they're deeper than any other head supports I've seen, so they hold babys' head better, and you can get them in quite a few different colors to match your car seat"

The seat is wonderful - easy to install, good LATCH fit, foot on it to level the seat out, nice lining. 

Unfortunately, we are going to have to return it and get another seat for our soon-due newborn!  It's too long (head to foot) to fit comfortably in our car.  We don't have center LATCH points, so it has to go behind a seat.  The car seat is so long, that once it is installed and at an appropriate level for a newborn, the seat in front of it has to be almost completely upright and pushed forward more than is comfortable for a 5'7"" person.   For reference, we have a 2003 Subaru Forester.

Before you buy this seat, see if you can find a friend that has one...check it out in your car to make sure it fits! I didn't expect it to be a problem - it wasn't with our first child's seat that was smaller.  

So, the benefit of this carseat (rear facing to 30 lbs!) could be it's downfall for you if you don't have a large vehicle"

I did oooodles of research and this Boulevard seat looks very comfortable and I liked the height/weight limit. Only my son hates it. The issue is with the crotch buckle.  It's not that it's anymore further back than others, it's just that it's too short.  There needs to be an extra two inches of strap beneath it, like practically every other carseat on the market.  He grabs at his crotch (he doesn't wear diapers) and says ""ouch"" when I buckle it and/or refuses to get in the seat without a struggle.  The little pad thing they have attached doesn't appear to do all that much.

I did try this rear-facing to see if my 8 month old (29 inches, 20 lbs) had any issue with comfort and he didn't appear too. It seemed fine for him.

The latch straps, which shouldn't be twisted to attach, have to be twisted in order to attach to the seat in my minivan (there's only one way it fits).  I'm not impressed with that and will probably use the belt if we keep this carseat.

Also, something that bugs me is the buckles that snap into the crotch buckle, only one of them actually ""snaps"" in, the other doesn't give that ""it's buckled"" snap like its partner no matter what I do. After all the Britax hype I've read, I really expected a little better.  I like the lever adjustment on the Alpha Omega Elite's headreast versus the knob on this one.

While this carseat looks cushy and nice, and I'm sure safety wise it's top of the line, I think we're going to sell it and just get another Compass booster seat like I bought for our husband's car (my son LOVES that seat).  We've never had trouble getting my son to ride in a carseat until I bought this one and I can't wrestle a 3 year old several times a day into a car seat.  If you're buying this for an older child, you might want to have them try it out first to see if they find it comfortable"

My only complaint is it's hard to get it centered/level in the back seat when it is rear facing (I have a 04 camry and my husband a 06 corolla). The tether wants to pull it to one side or the other.  We also had to pull out the back support pillow in order to get the latches to click without cutting off the circulation in our daughter's legs.  But the cover is very luxurious - more so than you can see from the picture.  I was holding out for the Shannon cover but Britax kept pushing the release date back, and I needed to get a seat quickly as my daughter was outgrowing her infant seat.  I was very, very happy when I saw how pretty the cover is.

Other than the asthetics of the seat, it seems very solid and safe, and I am very comfortable knowing that it is keeping my daughter safe and secure when we are driving"

It is by far the easiest to use (I've used A LOT of car seats!) and has the best features. I really like that you don't have to take the seat out to adjust the harness height. The fact that this seat can be used forward facing up to 65lbs and 49"" is what sold me on it the most. I wish this seat had been around for my first child, who was off the charts for height, we had to put him in a booster seat at age 2 because he was too tall for any car seat we could find. The total side impact protection is another BIG selling point, no other seat has that! it is easy to install, rear and forward facing-I have used it in an explorer, escape and tahoe with no problems. People have said it is bulky, but it is not really any larger then other seats, just taller. Compare them side to side at the store and you will see :-) The seat is also very comfortable on long trips (8hrs with no complaints!). Another thing I really like about this seat is that the straps don't get twisted! We had a Alpha Omega and the straps were forever twisted and were such a pain! We have been using this seat for a year with no complaints what so ever. There are so many wonderful things about this seat I could go on all day. I had the seat inspected and the person told me that Britax IS THE BEST, far exceeding US safety standards. It is well worth the price for the peace of mind you will have. We also have the Britax Parkway booster seat with the total side impact protection and love it as well!
PS-  I have read from others that the seat cover is not machine washable, I washed it on delicate in cold water and it did no damage-looks as good as new"

She looks SO comfortable and hasn't fussed once since we have put her in it, she used to fuss quite often in the carrier. This seat has plenty of room to grow and makes me feel safe with her riding in it, this price is on the high side, but how could you compromise the safety of the most wonderful thing you have?!

I must abmit that the seat is quite bulky and probably wouldn't fit great in a small car, but I think it is perfect for our 4Runner. I have seen friends with other seats and I must admit that there is a definite difference in quality; Britax spared nothing! I wouldn't think of putting my daughter in anything else after owning this seat"

The bassinet has clips of it's own that go on the side and the tent's clips have to fit over the bassinet's clips.  Sometimes the tent's clips slide off.  One of them actually broke.

I bought this mirror because of the remote.  I have a Ford Freestyle with a headrest in the middle, so it fit perfectly and does not block my view.  I bought a mirror, so she would have something other than a carseat to look at while I'm driving, not so that I could look at her, even though I can see her from my rearview mirror.  I have used it from the passenger seat to see her, and to relocate a pacifier.  What I like about it is that once you turn it on, it stays on.  I don't have to turn it on every five minutes like some toys.  It also has adjustable noise levels, and lights and/or music, but you obviously can't do that from the front seat, so I leave it on the same setting.  I have had no problem with turning it on with the remote, I have it clipped to my sun visor, and it works from there (but the angle is right in my car, I guess).  The only complaint I would have is that the lights are hard to see in the daytime, but she seems entertained by what she sees in the mirror and the music, and at night watches the lights.  It's a little more expensive, but worth the money in my opinion. "

The doctor prescribed several creams and the rash would disappear only to reappear within a day. I was losing my mind. I wound up making a special cream that my doctor had given me the recipe for. Unfortunately it didn't work and the battle of the diaper rash continued on.

I tried all sorts of other creams (Weleda, Burt Bees, J&J, herbal salves...) and this all ended when I bought Boudreaux's Butt Paste! I put on one application and the rash was reduced to a slight pink area near the rectum. After the next application...Tada!! GONE! 

It has been 2.5 months ago and my daughter has not had a problem with diaper rash since. I have reccomended Boudreaux Butt Paste to all of my friends battling with diaper rash problems with their kids. They are all converted! Love the cream. 

As for the comment about not knowing the percentage of zinc oxide, it's right on the tube and in the information provided on the product page above. The cream contains 16%. Some children may have a reaction to the Peruvian Balsam. None of the babies that I know who are using this cream have. It's in the same family as vanilla and cinnamon and contains essential oils similar to those in citrus fruit peel.

I suspect that if you are sensitive to these oils your child may be too. Just like any product, use your best judgment."

Assembly took 15-20 min. Tried it right away with my 3 month old baby - she felt asleep 5 min after I put her in the stroller /at the reclined position/. The ride is smooth and soft, it's comfortable for me and for my baby-girl. The rolling pad will be really useful in the summer - we leave in Arizona.  The canopy isn't large, but it works - you can position it even in front of the baby so it'll protect her from the wind /from the waist up of course/! We love it and I highly recommend it. It's perfect for that price!!"

It folds up just as compact as a regular umbrella stroller yet it offers so much more.  The handle bars are cushioned and set higher up and out so your feet don't run into the wheels like other umbrella strollers.  The seat reclines just enough that baby can snooze comfortably.  My 11 month old daughter climbed right into it and fell asleep during our walk and slept for a while after.  The cargo bags are great for holding keys, cell phone and snacks so you don't have to concern yourself with a diaper bag on quick trips.  Even though the canopy isn't that large, it works well.  You can position it so the sun stays out of baby's eyes.  The wheels actually have suspension.  When I would roll my old umbrella stroller down the sidewalk and I would hit a bump, my baby would just about get whiplash.  But in the Kolcraft, we roll over the streets imperfections very smoothly.  Plus, we love the color"

However, when we were shopping for one, the rocking ottomans all seemed really awkward. Trying to rock with my feet up and on another rocker didn't make sense to me. Also, we were on a budget, and another couple hundred bucks for a footstool seemed like alot. This stool is the PERFECT alternative. It puts your feet and legs in the perfect position for rocking and nursing. My baby is 6 months old now, I'm still nursing and use this everyday. What a great value, and dramatic savings over the ottoman. The only thing is, I wanted white, so had to search medela.com, because only natural was offered here at the time. Hopefully that has changed"

I have been using it now for almost a week, and it definately makes a diffrence. Although when you look at it, it doesnt look like much. Well there isnt much to it but the design is what makes it so wonderful. I am only 5ft 1in in height and I have to say it pretty much accomodates everyone, if you have longer legs you just set the stool further out from what you are sitting on. If you have shorter legs like me you bring it closer to what  you are sitting on. It does make you more comfortable while nursing, after nursing 2 other kids and now nursing my 3rd child I can tell the diffrence. It doesnt really matter how big you are on top either or if they are droopy. Which is something a great deal of women experience when they have breastfed, including me. Sorry about the description of that but just want to give the most accurate comment I can, telling about benefits of using this with normal problems.Overall I would definately recommend it to anyone who breastfeeds. I will definately be using it after I am done even"

My little one didn't like all of the ""fancy"" chairs with lights and such right away.  She would cry or fidget in them...I think because they were overstimulating.  But I could always put her in this chair!  It is soft and looks comfortable (she always seems peaceful sitting in it).  It can lay flat or be inclined slightly so baby can see things.  I also like the little head rest to keep her head from flopping all over the place...a lot of the other chairs aren't as ""new baby"" friendly.  It also offers vibration and music, which is nice.  Now that she is a bit older, she likes the animals on the bar and talks to them.  She still loves to sleep in it and it is a nice comfy place for her to sit (especially when I need a bit of a break).  I would recommend this to any new mom...it is a great chair for your newborn!"

They are good bottles and the nipples (silicone) work well for our son (age 3 mos). The only problem, and the reason I gave it four stars, is that the lid where you insert the nipple can warp if you boil it for sterilization, and then there can be major leakage around where the nipple should seal. This is a function of its being PP instead of the tougher PC plastic. So, soap and water on the lids! You can boil the silicone nipples"
