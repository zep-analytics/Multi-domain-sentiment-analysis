It didn't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available, he just couldn't attach it safely and we ended up returning it. Also, although the mobile matches the theme, I found that the colors weren't very stimulating.

He loves it now to get him to sleep. The problem lies in that at 4 am, my husband and I awake to hear the mobile playing...scares us to death since no one else should be around to start it. We go into the nursery and our child is holding it playing with the animals....the clip that holds the umbrella part had broken off, causing the mobile to fall on the baby. (He thought it was the funniest thing in the world, he was okay, thank God.) But the little plastic hook piece was in his hand. If you have a 6-month old child you know that they eat everything they can find. I thank God that he didnt put that in his mouth. It is a great soother for the baby, but be sure there are no defects every day!

Davis,"Richmond, VA","The Leak-O-Matic fully lived up to its name.  As a new parent, I don't have time to do things once, forget about doing things twice.  I need simple and reliable- the Leak-O-Matic is neither.  It worked OK for the first few times, then I partially filled the tub and put all the items nearby necessary for bathtime.  By the time I returned with baby in hand, the Leak-O-Matic had dribbled all over the laundry room counter, soaked all my other items on the counter, water ran down onto the floor, under the baseboard, and dripped from the upstairs landing onto the downstairs foyer floor.  The Leak-O-Matic is the Hindenburg of all baby bathtubs.  It is too bad that I cannot give it zero stars. 

There are many people who say that you just have to assemble them correctly, but judging from the number of irate mommies here, I conclude that it is either too a complicated design or just plain crappy engineering.  Think about it- the number of people with young children who took the time to go online and tell everyone that this thing is a piece of cheese!  

The cups on the feet stick to the countertop so you are unable to positon the tub once it is attached.  The fabric mesh incline allows the baby to slide down into the water, so you're always repositioning the baby.  I'm surprised that this thing didn't come with a built in toaster for 'added safety'.

I did not research every single item on the registry- I figured that if the big stores carried it then it must be at least ""OK"".  Back it goes.  If you buy this thing, then good luck to you, and don't burn the toast!"

I'd like to smack the so called engineer that designed this infant tub.  My 10 month old son pinched his little privates so bad it gave him a blood blister. Yeah, OUCH!!!  The stinkin bar that goes between the legs slides in and out of place when the baby moves --SNAP! It pinches their private part.  Everything was just fine and then suddenly my son looked at me with such panic and then screamed and cried. I realize what had happened and quickly moved the bar.  OUCH!

Marrone,"Wallingford, CT","I'm not certain why there are so many glowing reviews for this product.  My wife registered for this item because the 4 stage tub looked good in theory.  Unfortunately, because of the collapsible design this ""bath"" tub does not hold water, it just runs out of the seam where the two sides come together.  There is a foam gasket around the seam that is intended to hold the water in, but it is useless.
The sling is useful for bathing an infant, and the removable ring does it's job of keeping an infant upright while learning to sit.  Unfortunately, by the time our infant was ready to sit we had already replaced this piece of junk.  I guess they call it Safety 1st as your kid can't drown in a dry bath tub"

But... we haven't been thrilled with this tub. The hammock can only be used until the baby is 10 lbs if i'm remembering correctly -- well our child was over 9 lbs at birth... so she used it like 2 weeks. Even so, the hammock sags onto this HARD BUMP in the middle of the hammock so the baby's back rests on this bump. Never seemed comfortable. Then we used it with the hammock attached only at the top like the instructions say but our daughter outgrew the infant side because her butt would slide right over the bump that was supposed to support her but she can't sit up to use the other side. There are better tubs out there"

Also, the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out...wet Mommy and Daddy!  So it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we'll use it when she can sit up, but I'm thinking we'll just use the big tub when she can sit up!"

Barnes,"Bay Area, CA","This high chair was great to start, but after a while the tray table would come loose on one side during meals. I thought it was me, at first, not latching it correctly but we soon realized it was my 9 month old releasing the clasp. 

Reluctant to change chairs we persevered and now, 3 months later, she can remove both sides entirely and send the tray and its contents crashing to the floor. I am worried that she will either trap her fingers as the tray comes loose or bruise her legs as the tray falls to the ground.

Fowler,"Louisville, Kentucky United States","I bought this chair because of the great reviews, I hesitated at spending so much, but figured that all the features would be worth it considering my son would be using it for a couple of years. 
Pros:
I like that I can roll it around to the table, or to the sink to clean up after meals. The height adjustment is easy and convenient. 
The cons:
Folding it up didn't quite work as I thought it would. It didn't lock into the folding postition...and didn't really save that much space. I would prop it against the wall, and hope that no one knocked it down. We finally stopped folding it up. The toys that connect to the tray were too dangerous for my son, as he would usually hit himself in the face with them when he was younger, by the time he was older, I didn't really need them. The battery operated toy has a funny smell to it whenever it's been running for a while. He did like it...but the buttons were too hard for him to press when he was younger. My son discovered at 7 months how to pull off the extra tray that can go into the dishwasher, so we don't use that. He's 13 months now, and last week discovered how to disconnect the tray itself and fling it off of the high chair. I washed the seat cover per the instructions, and half the time did not use the dryer, even though it said it could go into the dryer, and now the seat is bubling and cracking...I have to place a cloth diaper in the seat to protect my son's legs. If I had not spent $90.00 on the chair I would not be as disappointed...but he's only used it for 7 months."

I really liked that it was more of a cradle swing, that the tray was removable(in fact I never even put it on and it was great), and the fact that it swings side to side, like a crade, or front and back, like a normal swing.  My baby loved it, the music, the mobile, etc.  In the early months, it was the only place that she would sleep without me, so I loved the few moments of sanity that it gave me.

What I didn't like about it was #1, it uses a zillion batteries if you use the mobile regularly, and #2 the speed control was pretty stupid, I thought since all the speeds were the same, no matter which setting you have the swing on.  But if you can live with these complaints then this is an awesome swing"

Davis,"Richmond, VA","The Leak-O-Matic fully lived up to its name.  As a new parent, I don't have time to do things once, forget about doing things twice.  I need simple and reliable- the Leak-O-Matic is neither.  It worked OK for the first few times, then I partially filled the tub and put all the items nearby necessary for bathtime.  By the time I returned with baby in hand, the Leak-O-Matic had dribbled all over the laundry room counter, soaked all my other items on the counter, water ran down onto the floor, under the baseboard, and dripped from the upstairs landing onto the downstairs foyer floor.  The Leak-O-Matic is the Hindenburg of all baby bathtubs.  It is too bad that I cannot give it zero stars. 

There are many people who say that you just have to assemble them correctly, but judging from the number of irate mommies here, I conclude that it is either too a complicated design or just plain crappy engineering.  Think about it- the number of people with young children who took the time to go online and tell everyone that this thing is a piece of cheese!  

The cups on the feet stick to the countertop so you are unable to positon the tub once it is attached.  The fabric mesh incline allows the baby to slide down into the water, so you're always repositioning the baby.  I'm surprised that this thing didn't come with a built in toaster for 'added safety'.

I did not research every single item on the registry- I figured that if the big stores carried it then it must be at least ""OK"".  Back it goes.  If you buy this thing, then good luck to you, and don't burn the toast!"

Fowler,"Louisville, Kentucky United States","I bought this chair because of the great reviews, I hesitated at spending so much, but figured that all the features would be worth it considering my son would be using it for a couple of years. 
Pros:
I like that I can roll it around to the table, or to the sink to clean up after meals. The height adjustment is easy and convenient. 
The cons:
Folding it up didn't quite work as I thought it would. It didn't lock into the folding postition...and didn't really save that much space. I would prop it against the wall, and hope that no one knocked it down. We finally stopped folding it up. The toys that connect to the tray were too dangerous for my son, as he would usually hit himself in the face with them when he was younger, by the time he was older, I didn't really need them. The battery operated toy has a funny smell to it whenever it's been running for a while. He did like it...but the buttons were too hard for him to press when he was younger. My son discovered at 7 months how to pull off the extra tray that can go into the dishwasher, so we don't use that. He's 13 months now, and last week discovered how to disconnect the tray itself and fling it off of the high chair. I washed the seat cover per the instructions, and half the time did not use the dryer, even though it said it could go into the dryer, and now the seat is bubling and cracking...I have to place a cloth diaper in the seat to protect my son's legs. If I had not spent $90.00 on the chair I would not be as disappointed...but he's only used it for 7 months."

I researched the options and picked the Maclaren Volo. My first stroller before it was Chicco Capri, and it always bumped against my legs, which was annoying and uncomfortable. When the canopy broke, I got rid of it and decided on buying a new one for plane travel and local outings.
The Volo seemed great - light, handsome, convenient, and highly rated by parents.
I ordered the stroller and, upon unpacking it, was quite pleased with its appearance. I read the instructions and learned to use it. The stroller seemed sturdy, well-made, and easy to maneuver, not to mention chic.
The washable seat was a good idea, I thought. I liked how large it was (perfect for an older child), and how easily it moved.
When I took the new Volo around the block, I noticed that one of the double back wheels was not aligned properly (one was higher than the other and did not rotate, which caused the stroller to make a scraping sound). Then the other set stopped rotating when one(!) pine needle got stuck in it! I had to carefully remove it with my hands in the middle of the street. Needless to say, that's not the quality I expected, since every parent I know raved about Maclaren. 
The canopy kept sliding off the rails, as well - something you would NOT want at the airport, with your toddler and luggage and the car seat in tow.
When I got home, I looked at the wheels closely and tried to adjust them, but to no avail. They were flimsy (I could dent them with my finger if I wanted to!), way too small and just poorly designed. I immediately packed up the stroller and returned it to Amazon. 
I was very disappointed. One would think that for such a high price, the wheels would be usable - after all, they are the most important feature of any stroller.
I will stay with Chicco and order a C6. At least I know that the wheels are great, and you can't beat the price"

Marcoz,"Brandywine, DE USA","I usually love The First Years products.  I already had the fisher price healthy care booster seat and loved it.  I wanted to leave that one at my parents and have one to travel with so I thought I'd try this one.  I was expecting to love the swing feature, it was the one thing I thought was missing out on the fisher price one.  Well, I returned this chair w/in 24 hours and bought a second fisher price one.  Here are the reasons why; The base of the chair is hollow and wobbly, it is also very wide and didn't comfortably fit across a normal kitchen chair.  You have to attach the straps yourself when purchased and they are also too wide.  At their tightest level they were still way too loose to be secure.  Thought the swing out feature would be great but when the tray swings out, and then you wipe baby's hands, as you're putting your hands under his pits to lift him off, he's already got his hands in the leftover mess on the tray.  The back of the chair comes off every time you fold it down.  You have to take the chair apart to adjust the level.  And when folded up, it's not as compact and portable as fisher price's model.  Do yourself a favor and splurge the extra $5 for the healthy care booster seat. "

It was a pitiful sight. Poor baby. I don't know why they didn't allow just a little more tray space  and curved that silly bar out more so they wouldn't bump their heads.

I decided to go w/ bravado bra.  It has worked out much better.  It is comfortable to wear day and night. And as the milk comes in and out it is comfortable either way.  The sizes are more flexable then medela.  The strap support is better then medela.

We've either traded up or found a substitute for most of the things in here. Here's what I found: Item #1) The case is fine, but things do fall out all the time.  #2) I haven't used the tweezers yet, but the magnifying part sounds nice.  #3) The nail clippers were WAY TOO SHARP. We cut my daughter's skin more than once (but one was serious enough that we considered a hospital trip!) Now we use my regular clippers, and I haven't gotten her skin since. The soft grip thing actually make them slide around more, so it was tougher to cut where you wanted to. Trust me, it's easy to clip skin on fingers that little!  #4-7) The emery boards are very handy, but any emery boards would work.  #8) We got a different thermometer; this one was too slow. Faster ones are more expensive, but they're worth it for a sick squirmy baby.  #9) I haven't used the medicine dropper, but the one time she did need one, I actually asked at the pharmacy desk at a grocery store, and they gave me one for free (then later I found out we had this one.)  #10-11) The brush and comb are nice. I'm sure they can be purchased separately from the kit for less.  #12) My daughter's only 7 months old, and has no need for a toothbrush for awhile, since there are no teeth (and even when there are, I believe you wipe them with gauze, not a toothbrush for awhile.)
Basically, although this kit had tons of things that could be helpful and it wasn't very expensive, we have either gotten an upgrade on the things we use (thermometer), or have found other things that would work just as well (regular nail clippers, free medicine dropper.) I'm certainly not saying that you shouldn't get one, because I'd hate to say that and then have you find that you needed it. If you get it for a shower gift, great; if not, you can find substitute items just as easily"

You put the blade at the bottom of the cup, load the food in, then put a protective plate and finally put the top piece (which contains the motor) on top.  The concept seemed good and it is a compact size.  CONS:  1) The cup holds less than 1 cup of food...if you go over that amount, any liquids in the food start to splatter through and make a mess, and sometimes causes the motor to stop running...guess it shorts it out and I have to wait until it dries out before I can start again.  If you're trying to make enough to freez cubes of food, you'll have to puree several batches.  2) You can only run the motor for short periods of time...up to 20 seconds max or something like that for some foods.  This is fine for soft foods, but if trying to puree meats, for example, it sometimes takes longer than that and it becomes a hassle having to grind, wait, grind, wait....3) the motor that powers the blade is way too slow, cooked chicken or beef ends up being too lumpy, since you really need a faster blade to puree them.  I've found that the for pureering baby foods, the best thing to use is a blender, since the blade speed is much faster and the design helps to draw foods down to the bottom so things can get more evenly pureed.

Cloth Diaperers Beware!,"July 17, 2006","C. Mallon ""Attached Mama""",NH,"I researched many car seats and settled on this one. Safe and cute! But it has a *major* flaw:

The strap that comes up between the legs is too close to the back of the seat. My daughter, only five months old, was already almost sitting *on* the belt where it comes out. This mean that the buckle was way too low and tight, forcing the belts to cut into her chunky thighs and pushing uncomfortably on her pubic bone. 

I asked around online on some forums, and found many other mothers who returned this seat for the same reasons. Many mothers didn't find it a problem until their child was at least 20 lbs, but it was a problem for me already, because we use cloth diapers, so my baby's butt is bigger due to the 'padding.'

This car seat wouldn't work well if your child is chunky or uses cloth diapers... and even otherwise, I can't see how it would work for a child over 25 lbs or so... The Britax Roundabout has the croth belt at a different location, a few inches further out from the back of the seat, so it is the one I am getting as a replacement"

These bags do NOT have a ziplock seal on them, which means that they are leaky and unreliable if you are in a hurry (like if you have more than one kid and you work).

Buy the Gerber or the Lansinoh bags with the zip seals on them.  They can both be stored flat for more convenience, and they can stand on their own.  Pumping into a bag is fine if you are someone who wants to fumble with attaching it to the pump (the Medela bags), or you can use your Medela pump with your reliable pump kit and pour your milk into a Gerber or Lansinoh storage bag for ease.  I use the Medela Lactina Plus, and I find that this method works the best for me.  Simple, clean and easy. "

There are some additional drawbacks as well.
1)  These leak in travel.  Twice we've gone to the park with 7oz, and arrived with 4 and a mess in the bag.
2)  We see no difference in reducing gas. And while these are designed to take gas away from the collar on, what about all the air in the nipple where the air first enters?  Is this a gimmic?
3)  The flow is too fast.  We went from bottles with smaller holes and less flow to these, which are far too fast for an infant"

It's easy to steer one handed when needed and folds down very compact. However, now I am suddenly having problems with it folding while in use. It does it with both my 2.5 year old and my 9 month old, so its not related to weight. Every time it's happened I have been right there, so there have been no injuries, but I am leary to put my children in it now. I contacted Chicco and was told, ""Sorry, you are out of warranty"" Their products carry a 1 year warranty, and I purchased mine a year and a half ago.

""Lissa325i""",Northern KY United States,"I purchased this swing because we were out of town and it was much needed.  We have the full sized Papasan swing and the travel Ocean Wonders swings at home (which in retrospect, we were wishing we brought with us).  While neither of those are 100% perfect, they are much better than this one.  The open frame allows the child to kick the swing frame, stop the swing from moving, and potentially get their feet/legs stuck in between the bars.  ALso, the swing seat almost lays horizontal (with the foot part of the swing MUCH higher than the head position)while swinging, to the point that I am afraid if my daughter would wiggle a bit, she would end up tipping the seat backwards and land on the floor. Lastly, the mobile is horrible.  It's pitiful and I find it hard to believe that Fisher Price put something like that on the market.  It's a plastic leaf that has little notches for two toys on strings.  The strings have a not on the end of them and you slide it into the notches.  These toys remain on the notches for approximately 3 seconds.  It's a very poor design and needs a LOT of work.  And my daughter ends up in a crumbled up ball on one side of the swing more times than not - it doesn't seem to have the support that our other 2 swings have.

That said, the swing is very attractive and appealing.  I only wish it were better made and more thought out. "

You can't go off someone else's experience, you REALLY have to experience it for yourself. First of all it's too bulky. The suction thing on the tub didn't stick and it was in the way when I tried to shower and kept falling down. My poor baby kept sliding because there is no non-skid at the bottom of the tub, so I had to go out and buy a small mat to put at the bottom. 

I bought this tub only because my baby was out growing the fold away bath chair but it looks as though I will have to continue using it and buy a larger one for her. I was very temped to send it back but I'm just going to sell it on ebay.

Turtle:  The turtle was used for about 5 months while my nephew stayed with me and then was put up until my new baby would be able to use it.  I dryed out all of the bath toys and they were stored in an open air toy bin for about 6 months.  I finally felt my daughter was ready for toys in the bath and put the turtle in the water and noticed black stuff floating in the water.  There was mold/mildew growing inside of the turtle.  I tried washing it with bleach water, but more kept coming out even after repeated washings.  I finally just gave up and threw it out. I had several other squirt toys stored with the turtle and none of them had the same problem. 
Fish net:  The paint on the fish net is peeling off after only 5 months use.  The fish themselves are fine. "

I should have noticed the word ""wrap"", but I didn't give it too much thought. There are two main problems with this baby carrier:
1. You have to wrap every time you want to use it which is problematic if you have other kids who need attention and if you are wanting to use it out of the house. I live in SW Florida where in the summertime it is 100+ degrees. There is NO way I could stand in a parking lot, wrap myself up, put the baby in and get my other child without suffering from serious heat exhaustion.
2. It is HOT. Yes, this is a nice, stretchy breathable fabric, BUT, the fabric is much, much bulkier than standard baby carriers. Again, I hate to harp on the weather here, but there's no way I could take my other child to the park and wear this unless all I had on underneath was a tank top.
I'm also unsure how you would nurse while wearing this unless you had those special nursing shirts with slits in them. Otherwise, you'd have to jack your shirt up underneath the baby and the carrier to feed them.
On the plus side, it's easy to get wrapped up and easy to put a baby doll in and out of."

We had a horrible night both times we tried the Dr. Browns - she cried all night from a bad tummy ache from the fast flow (we used the slow flow nipples even!).  I also have a friend that had the same problem with her baby choking and gagging on the slow flow nipples' too-fast-flow (formula fed baby).

Once you get half way through your wipes, there isn't any way for those wipes to benefit from the warming device (placed directly below the lid) since they cannot reach it.

Earlier this evening, I opened the lock, and as the gate swung out over the stairs, the top hinge snapped off the wall and the gate tipped away under my hand.

Fortunately, enough of my weight was behind me that I was able to correct my balance (just!) and did not fall headfirst down the stairs. But it was a close thing. An inch or a pound or a second either way and I -- or, god forbid, one of our children -- would certainly have been badly injured. While I was taking a photograph of the broken hinge, the gate itself, which was hanging precariously by its remaining hinge, fell off and tumbled down the stairs.

The gate has been in place for six weeks, but has only been in actual use for a tiny fraction of that time as we have been out of the house for five of those weeks. NB this was a product failure, not an installation fault. The screws are still firmly attached to the wall, along with what remains of the plastic flanges around the appropriate holes in the hinge. 

I purchased the gate after reading the enthusiastic reviews here, but after my experience tonight, I would not recommend that anybody buy this gate, ever. (The review gives one star, because NO stars is not an option).  And I would expect to see a product recall very soon"

I disagree with others who thought it was difficult to adjust the item around the harness straps and that it was cheaply made.  I installed the sack and made the adjustment one-time.  The material allows weather and some liquids to just roll right off the fabric.

Sometimes it's a few drops.  But most times it's like a continuous stream of formula.  

A couple of times I wasn't paying close enough attention to the bottle while feeding and formula ended up soaking my daughter's bib, her sleep sack, her onesie, and my shirt.  The entire bottle emptied all over us before I knew it...the leak was that fast!  I tried every suggestion given to me:  mixing the formula in a seperate container, mixing it in the bottles, and using sealing disks to mix in the bottle; heating before adding to the bottles, heating in the bottles;  wetting the nipples, not wetting the nipples;  making sure the bottle rim was properly inserted into the nipple ring, etc.  

I wrote a letter to Avent and called twice about this issue.  Each time, the customer service rep spoke down to me and said I must not have read and followed the directions (which I had).  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE EXPENSIVE, POORLY DESIGNED BOTTLES!!!  These are the worst on the market in my experience. "

The leak is not just a spot here or there.  It is often a torrential downpour, leaking out the sides of the white cap.  I know many people who have had the same problem.

I now cover my babies with a cloth diaper so that they don't get soaked when - surprise! - the bottle leaks all over them.  Yes, I've read the directions and no, I don't over tighten the bottles.  You can't take them with you for feedings on the go since they will leak all over your diaper bag or cooler bag.  They are especially leaky when I prepare bottles in advance and store them in the refrigerator.  There is something about the cold or condensation that affects the seal.  The bottle must be disassembled, the top wiped dry and then reassembled.  Lots of fun with three bottles - especially for 3 am feedings.  Even if I am doing something wrong, a bottle that requires this much precision in assembly not to leak is not a very good product.  If I hadn't bought so many, I'd throw them all away and get something else.

It did not meet our expectations. I give it 2 stars just for the safety of it. Otherwise, I have a hard time finding positive things to say. It is way too heavy. Our baby was 7 lbs+ and from his early days, it was heavy to carry around. Now that he is almost 20 pounds at 5+ months, it is nearly impossible to carry him for any length of time. The adjustable strap often gets stuck and we really have to tug to make it work. On most grocery carts it is too big to have it face towards you as you shop. When you do clip it on to the cart, the front end is suspended in the air. I just put it sideways which is a pain. Also, the handle bar is built to be easier to carry...I don't agree. It is still awkward- I end up hooking it under my arm. Lastly, to put the handle bar up and down is very difficult. You have to squeeze the taps on both sides and really push hard to get it to release. I'm sorry that I don't have any others to recommend. I had hoped to like this and am just suffering until he doesn't need the support in the grocery cart---that is really the only reason I still use it"

They did help ease his suffering but he was also put on soy which seemed to help the most.  By this point, both babies had become attached to these bottles and wouldn't use anything else. 

At first I thought I must be doing something wrong for them to continually leak, and sometimes POUR out of the rim of the bottle. (I have a total of 4 kids and have been through lots of different types of bottles, none this bad!) We tried Everthing to stop the leaks - 
*using only all dry parts for each new bottle
*not heating or storing in the fridge with the valve and stem inside
*not overfilling

After an entire year of frustration with these leaking bottles I noticed that when my son would hold it by the nipple or squeeze the nipple, that milk would come pouring down the sides!  Finally, the answer to the leaks!!!  

Is truly a great idea and I hope they try to perfect it, but these have a MAJOR DESIGN FLAW - and babies drenched with formula in the middle of the night is no fun.  These items were meant for baby use, and for the price  it should help make babies' & mom's life easier.

Stick with Avent or Playtex with liners.  Thank you & Good Luck"

The tub is too slippery which causes his head to endlessly roll back and forth into the corners.

Bathtime is about bonding, so after a month and a half of fighting, we ended up taking our baths together.  My son prefered the skin to skin contact anyways.   
The tub is also a poor fit for any oval sink bathroom, and the one time I put it in the kitchen sink I filled it with water and it buckled.  Never tried it again.  If you want to wash your baby in the sink, get a foam sponge or a bath support specifically made for newborns.

Right out of the box, the seat pad wouldn't stay on the seat and slides around during use. I figured I could live with that since it was just a cheap seat anyway. After only 5 or 6 uses however, the clip that holds the seat belt adjuster to the booster snapped while installing the seat into our second car a few days ago. 

I tried to contact Evenflo to report this problem, but they were completely unconcerned about the failure of their product. They told me that they only warranty the seat for 90 days from purchase (and you have to have proof of purchase). They did offer to send me out a replacement part, but under the circumstances, I don't feel comfortable using the seat at all, so I'll be destroying and disposing of it. I explained that we were thinking of replacing the seat with a different Evenflo model and asked if a discount coupon was available to reduce the cost of replacing the defective seat, but they told me that out of warranty it was no longer their problem. 

Thank goodness this part failed while installing the seat and not during a crash, or my son certainly would have been seriously injured. We haven't had any problems yet with the other seat, but I'll be replacing it anyway just to be safe. After their horrible customer service, I won't be buying another Evenflo ANYTHING ever again."

In the beginning, it handled odors well too; even smelly diapers didn't cause problems. But as soon as I started feeding solid foods, things changed. It proved completely incapable of containing the ghastly stench of those diapers. My daughter's room is at the top of our stairs, and the stench didn't just fill the room, it flowed out her door and down the stairwell, so we were treated to a powerful whiff every time we walked upstairs. I took to leaving her window open and the fan on to air out the room during the day and emptying the pail before bedtime at night in order to prevent it from stinking up the house.

The first couple of months weren't bad, but after about 3 months or so, it really started to smell bad.  This horrid smell only got worse with use as time went on.

We tried everything we could think of to get rid of the smell-letting it ""air out"" outside, cleaning it with bleach or some other cleaning solution, putting baking soda in the bottom of the liner and even leaving a small box of baking soda inside the can but outside the liner, letting it soak in a bathtub of soap and water...we even bought some scented disc type things (can be purchased at Babies R Us) that you can put in the bottom and it only made the smell worse.

We continued to use it, but frequently had to let it air out or spray it with Lysol or something.  Eventually we used it less and less, and we just threw it away when we moved to a new home a few weeks ago-we'd had it for almost 2 years.  We knew there was no way anyone else would want to use it with that smell and knowing they couldn't get rid of it.  It was a real shame because aside from the smell, it was a great product"

It's not.,"October 14, 2006",goonius,a room in a house on a street in a city just like any other.,"In our pursuit for ultimate baby items, the infant carseat topped our list. What's more important than the safety of your first child, especially in so unpredicatable a situation as driving? 

Our search led us to this Graco carseat, and we added it to our wish list and recieved it as a Christmas gift, just before our daughter's birth in January.

The seat is fairly attractive, but its good points stop there. 

It's a bear to install. Not because it's complicated, but rather because you need an extraordinarily strong man (or a woman, unlike myself certainly) to install the base. We ended up taking it to an inspector who spent about 5 minutes tugging on the belts with all his might, and then huffed and puffed and told us ""That should be in there real good, now."" We examined it, and asked why the seat was still able to flip up toward the back of the car, and he replied, ""Oh they all do that, that's normal.""
Unsure, but with the safety rating to back it, we continued to use it. 

Throughout her first 7 months it was a cumbersome piece of equipment. Lots of bumping and banging it about to get it into the car with the baby already in the seat (we have 3 4-door sedans, a 1992 Subaru Legacy, an 80-something Oldsmobile, and my mom's 2006 Saturn Ion. With the seat already in the car, it's a struggle to get the baby in without bumping her head or catching her legs on the sides at least once - for me. My husband simply can't put her in with the carseat already in the car. 

Not to mention that, the seat - while installed in the car - has never felt especially stable, with the exception of my mom's Ion, which has the latch system. Of course, the drawback of the Ion is that my 6'1"" husband can barely fit into the front seat because the carseat is so large and cumbersome that he cannot move his seat back and so he is sort of smashed into the dashboard.

Then, in the past week the seat has begun to fall over while we're driving. Literally, go around a curve, look back, and her seat's at a 45 degree angle from the backseat of the car. My daughter is 8.5 months old still falls a bit below the weight and height limits for the seat. We've checked the belts that secure the seat, pulled with all our might, and the seat continues to malfuction. This is a safety issue if I've ever seen one. With enough force, she could end up directly on her side, say the force of a side impact in an accident. Upon closer inspection, I shouldn't be altogether shocked. The base of the seat is proportionately much smaller than the top where baby sits. Sort of like a wine glass, I suppose - so it's top heavy, and likely the heavier the load on top, the greater the likelihood it will topple at the slightest provocation.

Needless to say, we'll begin shopping for a new seat immediately. As for the Snugride, I would recommend parents think twice before purchasing it. I'd certainly never consider it for an older vehicle without the latch system, and I'd still take it for a trial run in a newer one that does have the latch system. In hindsight I wish I had shopped around a bit more."

My daughter was a small newborn, only weighing 8lbs at nearly 2 months, which was the first time I tried using the sling. And even being that small, for the 2 minutes I had the sling on I could already tell that the strap was starting to loosen. (Definitely NOT safe!)

It seems eccessive but I never found one that really was doing it for me. I started with Gracco carrier and it turned out to be a nightmare everytime I had to put the baby inside. My son was crying while I was snapping all the 1001 snaps it has there but after that he was stopping crying even though he wasn't looking too confortable.

When he got older (5 mounths) we bought a backpack carrier. This is a really really a nice buy. We loved it and so did our son. The problem with it is that I wouldn't put a baby younger than 5 mounths inside. 

So when my other son was born we tried this new carrier. I think that's the best for newborns because they don't have to support any body part. More over, when the baby sleeps, he is in a nice position and they seem to like it (even though I though his head was in a weird angle ?!?!) As soon as the baby gets heavier (8 or 9 lbs) it's getting a bit uncomfortable mostly if you have I large breast as I do. It slips from its place so the head of the child doesn't stand on your shoulder anymore but on your lower chest (so when you have a large breast the baby's head is really really in a weird angle !). I think that it doesn't worth the price for the time you use it. Now that my younger son is 5 mounths, I don't use it anymore"

Frazier ""saiwulfaz""","Walla Walla, Washington, USA","I've owned my Diaper Dekor Plus for just under 2 years.  At first, I thought it worked fine.  It was easy to deal with, and easy to empty.  The first liner that it came with lasted me 6 months (1 baby - using newborn diapers through size 2's).

However, the unit failed to control odors after about 9 months.  Since then I've had to hide it in various places of my home to keep the odor to a minimum.  Definitely not convenient.

The unit has one particularly fundamental flaw regarding odor control.  Unlike the Diaper Champ which allows you to deposit a diaper without opening the container and letting odors escape, Diaper Dekor has no such provision.  It has two ""trap doors"" that allow you to drop the diaper in easily, and then they are supposed to spring back into place.  Still, no matter how quickly you drop that diaper in, and let the top lid fall closed, strong odors inevitably escape.  Also, these ""trap doors"" are quite flimsy.  The hinge on one of them recently broke so that the door no longer springs back into its closed position, thereby contributing to the odor problem.  I inquired about a replacement from Regal Lager and they said I could purchase one for $10.  Instead I decided to purchase a new Diaper Champ, since I've pretty much had it with this thing.

Speaking of flimsy, there are two other flaws I've experienced.  Firstly, the plastic foot pedal has cracked and seems loose.  It still works, but I have to wonder for how much longer.

Also, the door on the bottom of the unit that enables you to cut off the bag and remove it does not close very tightly, once again contributing to a lack of odor control.  The door is only held shut by a small plastic latch, leaving a significant gap for odors to escape.

Overall, I have not been impressed with Diaper Dekor Plus.  However, contrary to what some people say regarding the liner refills, that actually was never one of my bigger complaints.  I did not find them cost-prohibitive at all, because you get 3 liners for $20 and I found that 3 liners will last me about 6 months of holding toddler-size diapers.  In the 1 year 9 months that I've owned this system, I've only had to purchase refills twice.  The only thing I didn't like about it was that I did find it inconvenient to have to purchase liners online (couldn't find any local store that carried them) and wait for them to be shipped to me, especially when there is no indication of when you will reach the end of your last liner.

Diaper Dekor is the only system I have used extensively, and I would not buy it again nor recommend it to anyone.  I'm hoping my Diaper Champ will serve me better"

I thought this mobile was great for the first 5 minutes, but then I quickly realized, I couldn't get the thing to shut up- darn it- they didn't put that option on it! How can this be? It is a $40+  dollar mobile. My baby just wanted to see it go, but the music, and sliding beads put him over the edge. This mobile is too loud, and the sliding beads are loud as well. It stimulates baby too much. Even after covering it up and arranging it under the bumper pad- it was still too loud.


The motion is actually quite hypnotizing and great, but ""Tiny Love"" RUINED it by not putting a ""silent running feature button"" on it.  I'd pay $60 for it if it would just be quiet!!!


If this mobile worked without sound it would be wonderful. As it is now, I can't use it that much- only when baby is at his happiest. Even then, the mobile wears him out- and ruins his happy state, because it is too loud.

I think I shall pry it open and try to break the speaker.  I am serious.

I rated it with one star, because I can only use it when my baby is at his most rested and happiest state. If he is the least bit tired, it overstimulates him and makes him cry. "

Surely being the most ridiculously expensive with all the highlighted bubbles beside features like ""clear reception"" and ""no interference"" I would be able to hear the baby's every move from every household location and beyond. 

We hooked it up in short order, turned it on, and *SCREEEECH*. Apparently a volume level that might permit us to hear the baby one room away would also cause some sort of massive interference between monitor and reciever. We tried shutting that monitor off, and plugging the second in the kitchen outlet - the entire length of the house away. No screeching, but it sounded like someone speaking from inside a tin can. Totally distorted, useless. You couldn't tell if the baby was banging on her crib bars or if someone was moving heavy machinery about in her bedroom. 

We've packed it carefully back into the box, and are hoping Target will take it back without a fight. Needless to say, I'd steer clear of this one. Our $20 Safety First monitor far surpasses this one - even on its last leg"

I still think it's cute, but just like many other reviewers say, all the music and talking and sounds are WAY too distracting to be able to actually learn potty training.  And, like other reviewers say, the sensor is NOT accurate, so it's always saying the child went potty when they didn't.  Very confusing for a child who's trying to learn to really ""go"" in the potty.

We're currently potty training our daughter, and we have three training potties -- this one, an older one that has a soft seat, and one that fits into the ring of the big toilet -- and this potty is the last one my daughter will pick when it's ""potty time.""  When we first got it she had a blast with it, using it as a toy and nothing more.  Now that the newness has worn off, she shows very little interest in it.  

If I had it to do over, I would have given her this potty without the batteries in it and without her even knowing it had the capability to make all the sounds.  

Here's a suggestion:  Don't put in the batteries until your child has mastered potty training.  Then, as a reward for his/her accomplishment, put batteries in and show your child what the potty can do.  With the training part out of the way, the sounds won't be such a distraction anymore"

We had several major issues with it.

1)  The pee guard.  It doesn't really latch on and STAY on.  Our son was irritated with the pee guard we he was first learning and kept ripping it off the seat then throwing it accross the room.  As luck would have it, when I would go retrieve the item, he would pee and since there was no guard, the pee would go everywhere BUT in the seat/ pot.   

To resolve this I had to use special adhesive for plastics (super glue didn't work AT ALL) which took 24 hours to set which interuppted our potty training.  It also turned part of the seat yellow which made it look dirty even when it was not.  But I had no choice- the guard HAD to stay on.

2) The sensors were too sensitive and would go off even when he did nothing.  He could just sdjust his position in the seat and it would tell him he did a great job going potty even though he never went.

3) The sounds and gadgets were TOO distracting.  He wanted to play with them and would turn around in the seat and this would sometimes be when he was about to pee and it would end up all over me/ the floor/ whatever was nearby.  I finally just took the batteries out and told him it was broken.

4) When he was ready to use the actual potty, we took it apart per direction and placed it on top of one of our toilet seats.  Everytime he pees I have to hold down his ""bits"" because the seat does not go all the way down to make a seal between the potty seat and the toilet seat, thus it leaks out from under the potty seat onto the toilet seat and then down the front of the toilet and onto his pants/ underware/ etc.  The pee guard is useless for this feature. Sometimes even when I do hold his stuff down, if he wiggles or moves, then he is not in position... There is only one position he can be in or it will go all over the seat and down the toilet and onto his clothes.

It was the most expensive toilet seat available at the store.  We thought we would be getting a top quality seat from begining to end of our son's potty training experience.  The price is what motivated me to try and make it work for us.  Finally, I threw the darned thing in the garbage and just got a circo toilet seat with a pee guard for the toilets.  It was the least expensive toilet adapter and it turned out to be the best.

If we have another child, I am going to get the basic toilet seat/ no frills and the inexpensive toilet adapter.  Both together were a fraction of what we paid for this seat and would be a million times less aggrevating.

Also, the stroller is hard to stear.  You need both arms on the stroller to push.  If you try to guide it with one hand then it goes in another direction.

The shade is barely big enough to shield anything, let alone provide protection for the child. We received a replacement cover, but was advised that this would be a one time replacement. The tiny cup holder that was not big enough to hold a bottle has already broken off. Our 8 mo. old is 17 lbs. and the stroller is very difficult to maneuver. For straight paths, great. If you have to take a turn or change direction quickly, do NOT plan on having the stroller transition with your directional shift. The front wheels get stuck and you have to kick them back forward or the stroller will not steer correctly when you are going straight. Having had a Pliko previously for my 4 yr old, we thought we could trust the name of Peg Perego. Unless you are seeking a light weight stroller that does not maneuver well, we woud not recommend this stroller to anyone. "

I was looking for a stroller with all the features of my full size Gracco but light weight and smaller to put in my trunk.  Well, after a couple weeks, I changed back to my umbrella stroller and use my Graco for longer trips.  Here are the negatives I experienced with the Peg Prego Aria:
- Poor steering.  Can not handle quick turns.
- Sun shade only works for direct overhead sun.
- 5 point harness is poorly designed.  The plastic hook is always coming undone and gets tangled.
- My drink holder broke.
- Overpriced for features and quality.
My positives are:
- Nice looking
- Easy to fold
- Lightweight

Martin,Virginia,"When we first received this stroller, we loved it!  It handled well--very smooth, easy turns, could be directed with one hand.  My one complaint was that the handle was too short for someone with longer legs.  But as we started using it more and more, we found it was not very ""user-friendly.""  For one, the way it opened was not intuitive.  We had to push it out and forward while pulling up on levers on each side of the handle bar. Forget trying to do this while holding a baby.  Also, the canopy was too small and doesn't meet the baby carrier canopy when used as a travel system.  As a result, to keep the sun off baby, we needed an extra blanket.  These were minor inconveniences, but the real trouble started when my son outgrew the baby carrier and began riding in the stroller solo.  We quickly realized how stupidly designed the harness straps were.  They simply slid into a clip on the back support, so my active son could easily move forward and unclip the straps.  He was still held in the harness, but he was able to move about a little too freely and could easily lean over or forward to grab the wheels.  Too, after about a year and a half of daily use, the handling deteriorated.  The wheels stick when climbing hills and when turning and I constantly have to backtrack to get them realigned.  "

As an Italian, I am ashamed to say this confirms to me the stereotype that they can make nothing that works but everything looks fabulous. I am only being slightly facetious. This stroller is very sleek and stylish, and light-weight, but that is where it all ends. 

The biggest flaw is the poor handling/wheels. Pushing and steering is a constant battle. Sometimes it just doesn't want to go. I have really tried to inspect where the problem is, and it does not look like the wheels stick. Rather, the whole body seems to flex too much when you push the stroller. Just gently rock the stroller side to side and you can see what I mean. Other nits include the Aria stickers coming loose and eventually needing to be torn off, and the baby's cup holder being both too shallow and too easily removable.  But the biggest problem is the handling --- it is not pleasant and we never use it anymore."

Notice the pictures that people have shared who state they love this play gym and so does their babies that the toys hanging on the playgyms aren't the ones that originally came with the gym.

The next problem I ran into is that while the bottom of the wrap is supposed to support the baby's feet like a womb, my son out of frustration to get out of it would just bust the bottom completely out so that his legs were completely exposed.  In fact, he tore the velcro that secures the bottom pouch to the top.

Our children are aged 2 years and 4 months.  While the 3 month old was still in his car seat/carrier, this stroller worked well for him.  He's now out grown the carrier, and we've put him in the seat of the stroller.  The shoulder straps are too tight for him and don't adjust well.  The seat isn't padded well and there is no head support.

Our 2 year old does not like the back of the stroller.  With the infant in the front, we have to keep it reclined, so my daughter has to lean forward if she's sitting in the back.  She hates standing on it because she is very short and she can't see anything.  She would much prefer to sit in the front.

We find that the basket in the bottom is practically useless. We can't reach it so we never use it.  There is no cup holder or tray for the parents.

It is also a bit bulky when folded and heavy.

So, I think that we will put this stroller in storage until the kids are older and get a double stroller with 2 seats for now"

I can find a place to put the parent cupholder, but there is no place at all to put the child's snack tray.  The stroller will not close when it is attached anywhere on the stroller.  The whole purpose of spending the money on this ""system""  (which was considerably more expensive than others in the store) was for my child to have a snack tray.  Therefore, it's going back to the store.  There are plenty of other cup accessories out there that are far cheaper than this... even the Prince Lionheart cupholder alone was very expensive... 

The product itself is also very cheaply made.  The ""s"" hooks look so flimsy I wouldn't trust them... again, they sell thicker, sturdier ""s"" hooks that look like they will work much better than this, so that's what I'll purchase.  Plus, the parent cupholder is also extremely flimsy... already the ""arms"" have fallen off several times and that was just moving it from the table to the kitchen counter!    

Thirdly, I'm not sure if it was the ""clips"" that came in my packet (perhaps a defect) or if they are all made this way... but it is extremely difficult to get the screws into the clips... and then they didn't fasten correctly.  No matter how I tried (I worked on it for close to an hour and I consider myself pretty good at these things!), I could not get the clips to tighten properly.  They continued to be loose... even with using the smaller screws.  Perhaps my stroller tubing is ""too small""??? Very unlikely, but it just might be the case.  

This is going back to the store, where I will purchase the insulated parent cupholder for $5, a package of two (thick) ""s"" hooks for $3 and my child will have to learn to ""deal"" with holding her snack cup and straw cup.  I will save myself $10, a headache and backache from attempting to continue to get this on correctly, and my child will get the added bonus of learning to be responsible for her own items!!!

The problem we had with the Genie is that it is too  hard to use.  You're supposed to put the diaper halfway into a neck thing, then twist twice.  When we did this, about 50% of the time, the twists would come undone, leaving the room exposed to the diaper smell.  Neither my husband or I could determine how to fix this once it happened, and ended up emptying the darn thing at least daily.  

The Diaper Champ, however, is one-handed operation, which the Genie is not (you can't open the lid with one hand holding a baby and the 2nd a diaper!).  It contains the smell incredibly well, as long as you follow the directions (fold your diapers into balls, and don't leave smelly stuff exposed to mess up the lid).

Luckily I bought the extended warranty and will receive a full refund (in-store warranty expired just 3 days previously).  

When I tested the stroller at the store, I thought it seemed very flimsy and felt it wouldn't last long (which is why I bought the warranty), but the idea of having such a great stroller is why I decided to take the chance.  PROS for the stroller:  very light, compact and easy to fold; easy to maneuver; great for tall people like me--don't have to hunch over to reach the handles.  There are some nice little things too, like ventilation for the back, a headrest, a cup-holder, and a reclining position.

CONS are: only rated for carrying children under 40 lbs in each seat (didn't know this when I purchased it)--I have a 35 lb. 2 y.o. and a newborn, so we don't exceed the limit there, but my 42 lb. 3 1/2 y.o. can't use it.  The canopy doesn't cover kids well from the shade (only the face--and that's a big deal when living in southern AZ--or if it's raining)--and when the seat is reclined (for my newborn) the canopy doesn't even cover her head (I have to clip on a blanket and drape it over).  My 2-y.o. practically is too big for it--her head extends above the top of the seat.  And finally, the general construction of the stroller is not sturdy.

Overall, this COULD be a GREAT stroller, but it's just not sturdy--obviously not, it broke--but one would expect that with a brand name ""Jeep"" it would be built better.  We only use it for walks and going out, no off-trail stuff--we used it about 10 times before it broke.  My umbrella stroller I bought 6 years ago is still going strong--why can't they make this just as well-built?   I would love this stroller if it were just built better"

In an effort to save money I started with this one. But I quickly realized I'd made a mistake -- it took *forever* to even get one ounce of milk. I ended up getting the Medela Pump In Style and loved it. I just wish I'd gone straight to that one and saved my money on this one.

For those of you who are trying to decide between this or a more expensive model, here are my two cents:

TRY THIS ONE IF...
- You have a very abundant milk supply
- You only plan to pump one or twice a month
- You wouldn't mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended period

INVEST THE MONEY IN A HIGHER-END MODEL IF...
- You're going back to work
- Your milk supply is medium to low
- You plan to pump more than two or three times per month

Gaddy,"Rock Hill, SC","I used to have a Graco Metrolite stroller, and I really liked it. However, I gave it to a relative because it went with an infant travel system. I bought a used Jeep Liberty Stroller, thinking it would be an upgrade, and boy was I wrong. 

I will simply list the things I do not like:
1) It is quite bulky when folded, especially compared to other strollers I've had.
2) It is heavy, awkward to carry, and there's nowhere apparent to grab it. Handles? I don't see any.
3) All 3 tires went flat. My local bike shop charged about $30 to replace them all (your mileage may vary).
4) My daughter was not interested in the steering wheel and since the battery that the previous owner left in it had corroded, the sounds didn't work so I can't comment on those.
5) It CREAKS when you push it. I'm not sure where the sound is coming from but we oiled the wheels and it still creaks.
6) The MP3 player, which is the ""cool factor"" and the only reason my husband has prevented me from getting rid of the stroller, has these small speakers near the baby's head, so in order to really hear the music if you're playing music YOU like, you have to turn it up. And the volume doesn't go very high. For the same money, you could probably buy some portable powered speakers and clip them to the stroller."

I was so sick of seeing fish, butterflies and primary colors all over our house - the neutral tones were a sight for sore eyes! 

But I've been so disappointed in this chair's function. With all the nooks and crannies in the buckles and straps, it's impossible to keep clean. The straps and parts of the vinyl seat became so caked with food that I threw them into the washing machine - even though the tags says not to.

The worst part of the seat is the tray. It's ridiculously wide -- too big for my dishwasher AND my kitchen sink! (And both are full sized.) The way my toddler smears food on the tray, there's no way I could just wipe it with a rag and be done with it. Washing it turns into an exercise in hosing down my countertops with the sink sprayer. Oh well, at least they get clean too...

Also, I agree with other reviewers that it's really difficult to slide the tray into place. I wind up shaking it around and my poor toddler looks at me like I'm torturing him. 

On the bright side, the recline feature is wonderful for infants and babies who are just getting the hang of sitting up. Overall, if I had it to do over again I'd pick a simple Fisher Price.."

But this chair (which we bought specifically because of everyone's praise) is miserable!  I don't understand why it got such high marks...  The tray is way too huge for easy cleaning and it (rather than the chair) has a ""leg separator,"" which means you can't set it down anywhere without it tipping all over the place.  We've also found that the tray can be EXTREMELY difficult to hook onto the chair, and doesn't push in towards the baby's belly far enough.  In addition, the clips that attach the harness are filled with grooves and can't be cleaned well, so they're beyond gross, just after a few feedings.  Of all the baby things we wish we'd never bought, this is number one on the list...  I can't help feeling that if we'd just closed our eyes and pointed at random to a high chair, we would have done better than this thing...

She has been able to scoot across her crib since she was a newborn so there was never an ideal time to use these.  Again, cute for the nursery set up pre-baby, but I wouldn't use afterwards"

I purchased the Britax Roundabout for my daughter when she was 4 months. At 18 months she was only 5 inches from outgrowing it. Since we had such a plesant experience with the roundabout we decided to stay with the Britax brand and purchase the Marathon in the Olivia print. I was very dissapointed.
I had a major issue with the straps comming loose while we were driving. When we would get to our destination the straps were so loose there was virtually nothing holding her into her seat. A huge scare for any parent at the thought of what could happen when you slam on your brakes. It also lacked the supurb comfort that britax boasts of. My daughter was never as comfortable in the marathon as she was in her roundabout. The rubber things that go over the straps were also incredibly annoying. The constantly slid down out of place and by the end of the trip the chest clip was in my childs lap. That coupled with the straps comming loose were defentially not expected of britax high saftey standards. I went through quite the fiaso returning this seat and after 3 returns I bought the Eddie Bauer seat instead. So far I have no complaints. I wouldn't waste my money on this. Buy the roundabout if you want Britax name, but please dont bother with this Marathon"

I was proud of my purchase and showed it to many of my friends before the baby came.  Well, the ""mattress"" that comes with it is so hard that my baby won't sleep in it. She won't nap in it, and when I put her down all she does is cry.  I've tried everything to get her to sleep in this thing because it would be so helpful if she would, but she won't sleep in it at all.  I've even tried making it softer by putting blankets down on the board of a mattress and covering this with a receiving blanket that I tuck in the sides (something I don't want to do because of the SIDS factor) and that doesn't even help - it's still too hard of a surface.  Now, my baby is sleeping in bed with me and I can't get any sleep because I'm afraid of rolling over on her or her rolling off of the bed.  If they'd just make the mattress more comfortable for the baby, this would be a perfect product and I'd rate it a 5, but because it's virtally useless to me and my baby due to the mattress/board, I have to rate it only 2 stars.  I'm so let down by this product"

Most pieces were assembled using a nailgun & some of the nails were even bent. The cracking stemmed from areas that had been nailed & continued all the way up the piece of furniture. Had the co pre drilled the holes & used screws instead, this would've never happended. Obviously it's ""cheaper"" to use nails instead of screws. We took pictures of the dmgs & I wish I could  attach them to this review so you'd be able to see for yourself. There were also several areas inside the crib which weren't sanded properly & would be a real hazard for little fingers b/c of splintering wood. It was advertised to be constructed of hardwoods, but in all actuality it's pine. When you think of hardwood, you expect oak or birch, not a softwood like pine. The tops of the furniture & the drawer fronts were the only pieces that were solid wood. Everything else was particle board.

Anyhow, when he uses them, he spits up where he didn't with the competition. I tried to figure out why. If you tip the bottle over it drips constantly without any sucking.

As many reviewers have noted, it is extremely difficult to get this bottle warmer to work properly.
First off, the little vials you use to measure the water into are poorly marked -- Why did they choose to use teeny-tiny WHITE lettering? STUPID! It is then very tricky to get the proper amount of water into the vials. In fact the difference between say, level 2 and level 3 is maybe two drops of water! Trying doing that out of a standard faucet. In fact we use a filtered water faucet (with a thin spout) and it is still hard to get write.
But that's easy compared to figuring out the right water-in-the-vial to formula-in-the bottle ratio! We are currently using a 4oz Playtex bottle (with the disposable bags) and are contantly playing a guessing game as to the right amount of water to use. Level 3--- still to cold, but wait, last night that same amount of water practically scalded the formula! And just try to use a vented-type bottle...Forget it! How about an 8oz. bottle? NO WAY! Either way to cold or way to hot.
And even though we use filtered water, this thing still need to be cleaned with vinegar (as recommended) evey week or so. However, the cleaning barely hepls and after less than 8 weeks of use we now use the microwave more and more. Why? Because we know that 4oz. of formula will always need 6-7 seconds in the microwave...Every time"

If so, parents are S.O.L. Heating is SO inconsistent. Same amount of water with the same amount of milk will produce a different temperature every single time.  Sometimes way too cold and sometimes way too hot. When the heating indicator light turns off you must be right there to pull the bottle out or it will continue to significantly warm the bottle without any water medium.  Be sure to loosen your bottles cap during heating and check to see that the travel disc is not in place.  Otherwise, the bottles (esp. Brown's) will overflow.  If that happens cleaning the inside of the warmer is a major hassle because the milk will have burned onto the heating plate. The carrier is too short for Mr. Brown 8oz. bottles or any other of similar height. The tubes provided to premeasure water are a joke. The caps are so hard to close and open you need two really strong hands and maybe multiple tools to shut or flip the tops open.  Of course, you will likely be holding your crying and squirming baby in one arm while trying to do open the cap and not spill all the water. They tried to get fancy with the shape of the tubes and cap they forgot to make them easy to use.I just can't believe that someone can't design a better ""mouse trap"".
To add insult to injury, the taps on the handle that are supposed to hold the top of the bottle storage compartment just broke off...

Also, if I adjust the base so that the car seat is flatter, it would roll around a lot more (I have leather seats). Additionally, the material on the seat is not breathable--it is velvety--so my son's back and head would become very sweaty on longer trips, even in the winter.  I would say that once my son was bigger (about 14 pounds and 26 inches), I removed the head cushion and moved the seat belt to the higher position--this is when he actually ""fit"" into the seat, however the fabric is still an issue and his back and head still become very sweaty, making him very uncomfortable for longer trips.

But was I wrong! Everytime that I would go out with my newborn, and I would make a turn, the seat would flip over to the side, it did not matter how slow I made the turn it would always do the same thing. I'm a very carefull driver, specially after I gave birth to my son. You can't imagine how horrible it is, to look throuhg the rearview mirror, and see that your tiny little precious bundle of joy, has flipped over and his head is hanging. I would have to look for a place to park, and have to fix him and the seat. I had to move both the passenger and the driver seat as far back as possible, in order to hold the baby seat with the backrest, just so that it wouldn't tip over, and it made it a little difficult to drive.
You might say, she probably didn't install it well, but you would be wrong, it was perfectly installed, I had someone check the installation in my city, and everything was fine. The base of the seat is not completely flat, making it difficult for the seat to stay in place. This did not just happen to me, it also happened to my sister with her baby's seat, we had our children with a few weeks difference.
I had to get a different seat, I purchased one with a flatter base, and that one worked perfectly. I will never buy another Graco seat again, I believe it's worth spending more money on a better seat, I believe ones children are priceless, and investing money in their safety"

It definitely is not.  Patty is cute, but that is the only good thing about her.  To fill up her bottles, you must squeeze and insert into a glass of water, then squeeze again until water shoots out and then reinsert into the glass of water again.  It requires it to be done in such a particular way that only an adult can fill the bottles with water, no small child will be able to master the precise way it takes.  Then, to feed Patty you must hold her very still at an exact angle, where she is almost standing up.  Most children cradle their baby dolls in their arms, but Patty will not drink in that position.  Even in the standing up position, most of the water spills out of the tiny hole for her mouth and soaks her outfit.  It takes 5-10 minutes to fill Patty up.  Most children don't have the patience for this and lose interest, as my daughter did.  Plus since she has to be perfectly still and at an exact angle, only an adult can feed Patty her water.  Then, to make her pee, you must press her thigh very hard.  This distressed my daughter because she thought I was hurting Patty.  Once I assured her Patty was ok, then she was upset because she was not strong enough to press hard enough to make Patty pee.  My daughter is 35 months old and a lot of children start training earlier.  At 35 months old, my daughter was not able to fill the bottles, feed Patty or make her pee.  Only an adult can do these things due to the complexity of the bottles and feeding and peeing systems of Patty.  So my daughter quickly lost interest in Patty and started squirting water all over the bathroom instead with the bottles.  The whole ""teach the doll to pee"" part of the potty training was lost.  I wish I had gone to the store and bought a cheap wetting doll instead.  Then I e-mailed the company to complain, but of course received no response.  And you can't get a full refund if the doll has been used.  In fact, getting a refund at all is extremely difficult, I have just given up on that.  Don't waste your money.  This doll is too expensive and cannot be used by a child, which defeats the whole purpose.  Go to your toy store and buy a cheap wetting doll.

Big difference.  The backpack is compact, sleek, and inconspicuous but the pump sucks.  It has one adjustment for speed/suction and a computer chip that selects the best combination of the two for you.  Well, after a few pumps my nipples are about to fall off.  If I lower the suction to a comfortable, reasonable level, the pump is way too fast.  If I slow the pump to mimic MY baby's speed, the suction is excruciatingly painful--and it still doesn't pump slow enough.  I am very unhappy with this and wish we'd just rented the hospital-grade for a year instead.  

The little cooler is cute, but it's tough to actually fit the frozen insert (""blue"" plastic thing) AND four bottles in there.  And it is convenient for the horns to pump directly into standard-size bottles (it will pump into Dr. Browns & Evenflo bottles too, any regular mouth size bottles) or bags.  

I love the setup, just wish the pump had slower speed settings and that the speed & suction were truly adjustable and independent from each other.  I can't be in pain like this all the time and am looking for other options.  :( "

Thankfully the dealer was a local dealer and very good. He replaced ""just the pump"" in the pack with a new one. 
Per Medela's instructions, they actually want to send the broken pump over to them and they will take care of it, if it was under a yr old. It would have been very late for me if I were to ship it and they have to ship it back.

Now I'm looking for another one. It's difficult to pump if you have large nipples. You have to buy extra sheild which costs extra. It's noisy. It loses suction.The milk backs up to the tubing and gets moldy.I clean the parts everyday. I have contacted Medela a few times to troubleshoot the pump and they eventually sent me another motor (great customer service). It worked for a few months and now the same problem is happening. I guess it works for some and not others. Now I'm in the hunt for another pump since I want to exclusively give my baby pure breastmilk for her first year.

However, when our baby girl (1 week old) first tried to suck the milk out from the bottle, it did not come out. My husband had activated the vent and did everything according to the instructions. He thought the holes were not big enough since he did not see any on the nipple, so he put more holes on them but still nothing came out. He finally found out the way that these bottles work are not the same as a traditionally bottle does. The hole will not open unless pressure is applied against it and hole will get sealed back again when released. Baby has to use their tongue to push against the nipples in order to open up the hole. For a newborn infant, it is too difficult for them to figure out how to get the milk out especially if you are bottle feeding only. Luckily we had two Avent bottles (with the traditionally hole idea) so she is doing very well with the Avent bottles and she still loves them a lot. We ended up returning the unused VentAir bottles and got a lots of AVENT bottles but still stuck with the opened ones. I do not recommend these 'difficult' bottles for newborn. Baby should not need to 'think' how to get the milk out.

For leaking problem, we do not have any issue with the Avent bottles. When it leaks, it is usually because the nipples have not been properly placed (push all the way though the ring) or the ring has not been tightly screwed. We also found out if you use a warmer to warm the bottle, you have to unscrew the ring once and screw it all tight again after the warmer. It is because the theory of heat with expense the plastic bottle which creates a gap between the ring, nipples and the bottle neck. This works 99% for us with no leak.

We are the fans of the AVENT bottles."

The beeping from the parent unit WILL wake you at about 3am every night (unless you leave them on the charger).

2) Both of my parent units now (after only two weeks of minor useage) refuse to connect with the nursery unit, beeping endlessly.  ""Cycling"" them on and off per the prescribed (though not well detailed) manufacturer's trouble-shooting method has done nothing.  Only logical conclusion: the nursery unit has apparently died and is not sending out a signal.

Also: while they were working I did not really get the hype these units generated.  My home is a very common 1800 square feet of two-story ""box"" type arrangement.  The static would become unbearable once the parent unit was taken downstairs and (maybe due to a weak or faulty nursery unit from the get-go), the signal would cut out before we even got to the kitchen.  So we either got static or no signal at less than 50 linear feet from the nursery.

Pro:
-The range was great.  Whole house, plus 800ft outside.
-No interference.  I live in a dense suburban area with many sources of interference.
-Easy to setup.
-Shape/size of parent units are much better than others (especially sony)
Cons:
-Controls are not very straightforward.
-The unit always hisses.  It is not sound/voice activated.
-The power switch on the parent unit is a button that is not recessed.  When you turn it off, it does not beep or let you know that you did.  The button is easy to bump, and would make it easy to carry the thing while it is off, and you think it is on.
-The DEAL BREAKER: a power outage requires turns off child units.  With even a short power interruption, the child units come up in the ""off"" mode.  You have to go to the baby's room and turn them on.  Until you do, the parent unit will beep and flash red.

Remus ""Gadget Guy""",NY USA,"My wife and I purchased this baby monitor in preparation for the arrival of our first child, and after using it for almost 2 weeks I could not be more disappointed.  We were drawn in by the promise of a clear connection that would prevent others from listening in, but the many drawbacks far outweigh this one advantage.  

This is one of the more expensive and highly rated baby monitors, but you certainly don't get what you pay for here.  

Pros:

1.  You do get a clear connection when the unit is in range (see cons for a further explanation)

Cons:

1.  The biggest complaint I have is the battery life.  Even with the parent units on the lowest volume setting, you will not get more than 5 hours of use without having to recharge.  You will know when you need to recharge because the unit will start beeping loudly every 5 seconds until you put it back in the cradle to recharge.  This is a great feature to discover during the middle of the night.  The nursery unit is even worse, as it does not take rechargeable batteries and will eat through 3 AAA batteries in 6 hours unless it is plugged in.  Why they even allow this unit to operate without being plugged in is beyond me.  Basically all of the units have to be plugged in at all times.

2.  I have already had a couple instances where the parent units will simply not connect to the nursery unit.  They just sit there and beep like they do if you are out of range.  This required a couple of off/on power cycles of the nursery and parent units to correct.

3.  The range is not ideal.  I have a 2800 square foot, 2 story house and we have already had 1 issue where the parent unit would not connect to the nursery unit.  Granted, the units were about as far away as they can be in our house, but considering this distance was only about 60 feet, I do not think it is unreasonable to have complete coverage in our house.

4.  As other reviewers have noted, the lowest volume setting can be too loud if you are a light sleeper.  Since the speaker is always on, you will hear any ambient noise in the room amplified and played on the parent unit.  Several other monitors on the market have noise thresholds and will only transmit the sound if it is above a certain volume (i.e. if the baby is crying as opposed to shifting in the crib).  Also the LEDs are also extremely bright in a dark room.  

Unfortunately I cannot recommend this product.  We are making due with it simply because I refuse to throw away a $100 baby monitor, although I'm sure I would be much happier with a different product.  

If you can deal with leaving the units plugged in at all times and only taking the parent units out of the cradle for short periods of time, then this product would probably suffice, although I'm sure you could find a much cheaper product that would work just as well"

Dolata,"Suffolk, VA","I have never written a review, but in this case, I feel compelled to do so. I purchased the iMonitor last week as an upgrade to a Safety 1st dual monitor, for no other reason than I was tired of the interference. I was excited to learn of the digital technology, and once I got it home, I was anxious to try it. After a few nights trying it out, I was equally as anxious to return it and get my money back...let me explain:
To begin with, before you buy, please be aware that the lights and sound are awfully bright and loud, which was troublesome since I am a light sleeper. I would have been able to deal with it, but there are other problems as well...there are 'clicks' and 'crackles' that are intermittent, and, like I said before, not good for a light sleeper. 
The final straw was on the fourth night the parent receivers lost contact with the base -- I spent a half hour resetting it, reconfiguring the layout, powering on/off -- all to no avail. It kept beeping 'Out of Range' -- I was only 10 feet from the monitor at the time. Absolutely unacceptable. 
In all fairness, we do have a lot of gadgets that are wireless and may have been competing with the monitor, but that isn't an excuse..it says 'Crystal Clear Clarity' and '2000 foot range', but this is not, I repeat, NOT the case.
So, I packed it back up and went into Babies R Us to return it...here's the kicker: The salesperson at the store said that she agreed they had a lot of problems and she has seen more of the iMonitors returned than any other monitor. She rec'd the Sony, but it doesn't come with two parent units, so I have resigned myself to living with the Safety 1st..even with all of its interference, it is still superior, and 1/4 of the price as the iMonitor. 
I have no doubt that Digital is the next step in baby monitors...but so far Graco does not have it figured out...Save your money and give it some time so they can work out the obvious flaws in the system."

My poor little one had the springs poking at him. After further examination, we found that under the vinyl is a thin and I stress the word thin, layer of foam, then CARDBOARD piece and then the coils. What a joke!  Carboard!!!! Needless to say I went out today and bought him a much better, better constructed Simmons mattress. I should note my son is only 17 mths old, and the first five months of his life he never even slept on that mattress, so bascially he had only used it for 12 mths. Don't waste your money ....you'll only have to buy another one down the road. Take your money and buy a much better well known mattress for your baby!!!

OLeksy ""Mummy in UK""",UK,"Okay were to start. This car seat looks good on paper but that is it. When it arrived the box was completely smashed and the car seat already had a tear in it.If you have the LATCH system in your car you must find, and shove all the belts inside the seat.  Then pull them out the correct places.  Not so easy.  Then in order to attach it to the base you must pull out a metal bar and once the seat is attached, slide it back.  This is very hard.  So once there together it is a pain to take apart.

For facing backwards, if the seat is not level with your car seats, use a towel or blanket.  You shouldn't have to do that.  Plus with my baby in it his feet are still squished into the rear seat.  Once you turn it forward, to get the belts adjusted, you press a button on the bottom of the car seat and pull them towards you.  This would work fine if the BASE wasn't holding them so you CAN'T MOVE THEM.  We took the car seat off the base so we could adjust the belts.  What is the point of that.  

Once it is in your car the way you want it does suit it's purpose but I highly suggest buying something of better quality.  "

We have 10m twins, and have been using the stroller for about 4-5 months. It's terrible.

PROBLEMS: 

1. NO SUN PROTECTION. the visors are locked in place. Unless the sun is directly overhead or at your back, it will be beating in your babies' eyes, and you'll need to buy a non-Peg Perego sunshade accessory.
2. HARD TO STEER. It gets stuck going across the lawn and on compacted dirt. If the sidewalk buckles just an inch (common from tree roots), the stroller is stopped dead in its tracks. It's hard to steer in a straight line, so it's easy to get stuck when going through narrow doorways or down narrow sidewalks. 
3. IT'S FLIMSY. The bottom of the storage area underneath stretched and sagged after a month of use. It now drags on the ground and rubs against the wheels even when nothing is in it. The cupholder broke during the first week.
4. HARD TO UNFOLD. It takes two hands to unfold and you have to give it a vigorous shake to get it to completely unfold and snap into position. Don't even THINK about about trying to set it up with a baby in your hands: you need both hands free to deal with this thing.
5. BAD CUSTOMER SUPPORT. The stroller comes with no weight/height/age  suggestions. When we first tried to put our twins in it, they were swimming in it, and couldn't be upright. When we called Peg Perego and asked how big the kids should be to use it safely, the support rep said "" don't know."" 

Yes it's lightweight and folds up nicely. But the light weight is actually a drawback; it means the handle and legs are flimsy and wobbly -- resulting in a stroller that's difficult to steer. 

My advice would be to seriously consider jogging strollers. Even if you aren't an active parent -- I'm not -- get something sturdy with big wheels to get you over the dips and bumps and cracks and patches of sand, dirt, and grass that you will encounter.  If stroller size is the most important factor to you, look at ""stadium seating"" strollers."

Problems:
The uneven weight difference causes the Aria to pull  
The small wheels grab into anything softer than concrete (forget the grass at the park) 
The trays are too small for sippy cups and more than a couple of cheerios
The fabric storage area underneath is held up with six ""buttonholes"" that tore after a few uses with a not very heavy diaper bag
The straps are really tricky to figure out and I've never been able to get them right
The shades are very small and next to worthless
The drink holder is negligible and sometimes interferes with opening and closing the stroller

For the money I spent I wish I'd been less afraid of getting something a little heavier and go with a jogger style with a swivel front wheel.  It's amazing how weight of a stroller is an issue with your first child, but how Herculean you become once you have two.  Also, the whole one-handed open-close feature that I craved on my single stroller is a non-issue when you have two kids because it's safest to have them strapped into carseats before dealing with the stroller anyway.  If I could, I'd sell this one and get a jogger (I need something that moves on the mulch and grass at the playground) but I don't think I could sell this one for more than $20 in clear conscience.

And my kids have no problem pressing the blue lid-popping latch-and, of course, adding their toys or other opjects to the contents of the dirty diaper pail.
The twisting mechanism to remove the full bag is a great idea. It helps you not get the face full of odor when you open the pail... BUT you cannot let the pail get even close to full, or it wont twist. And after two years of use, the twisting mechanism doesn't work anymore. The latch for the small opening is also broken"

You do save money on refills at first.  But when the diapers become stinkier as the baby grows, you have to change the bag more often.

Con: Does not mask odors. I have 8 month old triplets and it doesn't help at all. Even with one baby, to change the bag daily is a waste of a big bag unless one baby goes through tons of diapers a day. With my triplets they still don't fill the bin in a day, about every other day. I have the original Diaper Genie with my 10 year old but thought against using it since we'd have to buy the refill bags so much more often with triplets. The old Genie doesn't hold as much but it sure holds the smell better. If I had it to do over again, I would not buy this pail, which I bought two, one for upstairs and one for down.

2. The gate is not sturdy. If anyone were to bump into it, I'm pretty sure it would break.
3. The mechanism to click/unclick the lock is more difficult than it should be. Fortunately, the people who will using it, have a strong enough grip to get it to work.

Despite these flaws, however, this gate does serve its purpose, in my case. I bought this gate to keep my dogs confined to a room --- which it does.

The car seat sits so upright that my sons head was always falling completely forward.  He never looked comfortable.  The car seat comes with the strap covers that are suppose to make the car seat comfortable.  These things only make it worse because they are extremely rough and bulky.  

This car seat is extremely heavy even without the infant in it.  The carrying handle is a joke because you have to push the canopy back to put your arm under it.  The canopy is also terrible because it barely works.  It only works when the sun is directly above you in the sky.  I was constantly having to change the direction I was carrying the car seat to avoid the sun beaming on his face.  (unlike the Graco where you can pull the shade all the way down)  I hated returning this because I really liked the looks of it but I had to for my sons sake.  I bought the graco seat in the blackwell print (which is an o.k. looking fabric).  

We are both soooo much happier.  He looks comfortable and a little more reclined.  The sun isn't in his face and I have $130 extra dollars that I can spend on something else.  I think people mainly buy peg perego because they like the way it looks (as I did) or because they expect it to be high quality because of the high price (as I did).  But in actuality it just sucks.  I wish that Graco would make their prouducts a little more stylish because they are definitly more practical and functional."

Just ridiculous. I own one, bought it on eBay for $28 since it was a local pickup only sale. I got a heckuva deal, I'll admit!

This is a fantastic carseat.....but folks, it's JUST an infant carseat! I went looking on eBay for one, since, having had babies before, I couldn't fathom shelling out even $100 for a cheapo, often-recalled Graco, let alone $229 for a Peg Perego!  All new babies sweat in car seats....they can't maintain their own body temp until 4 months of age, which is when they grow out of these seats (unless your back goes first) :).

I understand the precautions about car seats being in car accidents.....another folly of the infant gear industry. If car seats are in accidents, they're junk folks.....they aren't in re-saleable condition. And when was the last time that you heard of a car accident involving a baby? Because how many new parents of newborns who would buy a $229 carseat (read: first child) go out further than a trip to the store?

It's a regular old car seat. They can't do much to these, really, except change the fabric. They pretty much prey on your fear surrounding your new pride and joy, so they gauge you on your emotions....hey, I'm a sucker too!

Infant seats are notoriously small, so that you have to buy up the next size faster. They get your money on the car seat and then the stroller, before you are out of that hazy new parent fog and wise up. Save your money.....your baby or your back muscles will grow out of this in 4 months, no matter what.....and then it's $229 right down the drain, faster than a speeding bullet.....Guess you can save it for baby #2.

Think of it this way...for the SAME amount of money, buy a Britax Roundabout and have it last for 4 years versus 4 months, or go on eBay and buy one of these, 4 months old and pretty much brand new, for less than half the new price"

Rippe ""Belles Mom""","Orange County, CA","I registered for this tub wanting it very bad for my newborn.  I thought what a great idea for fussy babies to have a spa and not to mention the shower rinse.  Well, the first time I used this it took more time to set it up than I did using it.  Also, the button on the shower head IS hard to press, and the sprayer needs to remain upside down or it will leak water allover your bathroom(found that out the hard way). When you use the spa bubbles it makes the water cold very quick.  My daughter does love the spa effect, but I think she prefers warm water throughout her bath.  The one thing that has really annoyed me is the baby sling has a moldy smell to it.  I have washed and dried it many times and cannot get this smell out.  Needless to say I had to purchase another insert for the tub, which doesn't fit very well, so Im a bit irritated.  Overall this is a good idea, it needs some kinks worked out of it....Just not worth $40.  So now Im off to target to purchase a new tub :-"

Usually I can find something to do with a junky product, but this is so junky I can't do anything with it, I might as well have just washed the money down the drain.  The fabric is rough, too rough for a new baby, the hole is too big for a tiny baby to lay atop it well but a bigger baby laying on it even on the bottom of the tub as intended is unstable.  As a seat it immediately fills up with water if you even touch it, once filled it sinks.  How can it support a baby if baby can't touch it or it sinks.  You have to ring it out in order to use the plastic hanger it comes with b/c it absorbs so much water it is way to heavy for the convenient hanger, the hanger ends up bending so much the thing slips off or it looks like it is going to break.  Not easy to do with baby in hand so you have to leave it sitting in the tub while you get baby out and get a chance to go back later.

Esquilin,"Sasebo, Japan","I bought this seat for my son when he was probably around 6 months old and just starting on solid foods.  Ten months later, I hardly ever use the darn thing.  It worked okay for us for a little while but it was not one of my better baby purchases.  My complaints with the product:

- Not particularly sturdy.  The backrest portion in particular seems to pop off way too easily.
- The straps that secure it to the kitchen chair are annoyingly long and in the way.  Not such a problem when the seat is secured to the chair because you can just tuck the straps in somewhere.  However, everytime I remove the seat from the chair the straps prove to be a real pain in the rear.  And unfortunately it seems I need to unstrap and remove the seat after every meal to clean the bits of food that inevitably end up on the big chair to which this seat is secured (another complaint).
- The second tray which pops on over the swing away tray (at least on my particular model) is very easily removed by my son.  He lifts it up and dumps his food on the floor.  The point of this second tray was to make food prep and cleanup easier but it fails miserably.
- This seat is not at all sturdy or useful as a stand alone seat.  It HAS to be strapped to a chair or it will easily tip over. 

The good things about this product are that it is relatively inexpensive and is a good spacesaving alternative to a regular highchair which sucks up so much floor space.  It is also fairly easy to clean due to the plastic design.  

Overall it is not a bad product but not on my list of favorites.  If I had it to do over, I would have bought a similar type of chair but probably a different brand"

Now we've returned it.,"November 27, 2006",Jay F.,"Detroit, MI","We started out really liking this seat.  Its colors are not horrid like most of the others, and it doesn't cry ""I have a baby!!"".  It just looks nice and stylish.  Also, our baby seemed very comfortable in this seat.  HOWEVER, the #1 problem of this seat is its straps/belts.  

First, you clip them together at the baby's midsection (easy).  Then you need to try to get these 2 pieces to fit together at the bottom, so you can clip them (as one) into the female end of the lap belt clip.  This is easier said than done, as these 2 pieces are very difficult to hold together as you clip them (as one) into the other part of the belt clip.  It's hard to explain properly, but really, it's not easy to do, especially if you have only one hand free.

Second, the belts get twisted.  The 2 pieces at the base of the belt, which need to be held together so they can clip into the female end of the belt clip, they get reversed because the belt twists.  Think of taking your seat belt in your car, and somehow twisting the belt itself, so the seat belt clip now faces the wrong way.  If this has ever happened to you, you know what I mean, and it's a pain to fix.  Just like with this seat.  It seems to get screwed up effortlessly, but then to fix it takes several minutes.  

FORGET THIS THING!!  We bit the bullet and exchanged it for a Peg Perego, after we used a friend's when we went to visit them for a long weekend, and realized that not all the infant seats sucked like ours did.  The final problem we noticed is that this seat was that our 14-pound son was basically already too big for it...  Yet the Peg Perego had plenty of growing room.  Yes, it cost us about $100 more, but it's well worth it for the ease of use and the fact that our son will fit in it until it's time for the standard (non-infant) car seat"

I guess this seat is okay, it is nice and plush but the downside to getting a backless seat (which I didn't think about before I purchased this) was the fact that the kids can't fall asleep in these seats. My kids like I am sure most kids are when they go for a drive the motion knocks them right out.

I can say that this seat is very lightweight which is a big change coming from the regular child seat. "

Sadilek ""bouncing mama""",california,"I ordered this product for my 3 year old who just moved into a toddler seat and had head slumping problems! The two major problems with this product is that 1.) it's quite bulky, and so her head would tend to fall forward anyway, and 2.) check if it will fit in your carseat. I have the apex toddler seat that is quite wide, and you can't leave the pillows in place, they stand up at a 45 degree angle. I attached elastic to the bottom in order to fix them to the plastic that holds the seat pad in place. This works, but obviously only if you're sitting next to them when they fall asleep! Other than that you'd have to stop the car, get out and attach them, then go again, by which time the child is probably awake anyway! To be honest, I haven't seen a better alternative yet though. It's quite good to pull around and use as a pillow for your own head on long trips though"

Peters ""Vicki Peters""","Newark, DE  USA","Perhaps if I hadn't already had a different type of bunting, I wouldn't be so disappointed with this one. My sister loaned me her Eddie Bauer bunting when my son was born. She will be having her next baby any week now, so I had to return it to her which meant I had to buy a new one. I saw nothing but great reviews on this product, so I picked one up.

First of all, I followed the washing instructions, washing it separately on delicate and drying it on low, and it ripped at the one seam!! Based on that alone, I will be returning it.

Aside from that, having used a bunting with a different design, I am not thrilled with this one. Part of the point of using a bunting is so that when you're in a car where you have heat, you can open up the bunting on a longer drive so baby doesn't overheat. This bunting zips down both sides to the bottom (by the way, zipping/unzipping is tricky with a baby kicking around; the zipper gets stuck in the material a lot), rather than down the middle front (that style zipper was NEVER a problem). Then you have this thick cover at baby's feet and nowhere to go with it, as the bottom of the carseat is up against the back seat of the car! So you either have to rig it so it is up the back of the seat and tucked under the headrest, or you have to leave it on baby's legs.

Also, the top of this bunting does fold over so that baby's face isn't covered unless you want it to be, BUT...my 5-month old has no problem picking it up and pulling it up over his own face. He did it this morning on the way to daycare. This bunting is too thick for me to feel comfortable with him doing that. And I can't be reaching in the back seat to pull it down off his face!

There is no disputing that the concept of a bunting is great, and that this particular bunting is toasty warm. It is wonderful being able to put the baby in his carseat and strap him in safely w/out a snowsuit being in the way, or having to bundle him up before going out and unbundle him every time you get to your destination. But I don't think the design of the Urban Bundle-Me is great and I actually think this bunting is TOO warm (even with the bunting open on a long car ride the other day, my son's back was all sweaty when we took him out of the carseat). After calling several stores and looking at all my options at Babies 'R' Us, I ended up ordering a new Eddie Bauer All-Season Bunting from Target.com (which cost less than $20 including shipping). I can't wait till it gets here. I will be returning the $60 Urban Bundle-Me as soon as I can"

So either this is a Storkcraft problem or a SEKO problem, but the head board had a piece completely split off in two and the other pieces were dented or chipped off. Walmart is re-odering another crib and having this one picked up for me as it is an 80-pound box.  Hopefully the next crib won't be damaged, but if so, I am giving up on Storkcraft completely. Walmart didn't have a rating system to leave comments, and when I saw others on this website that had damage problems, I wanted to relay my experience as well.  Walmart graciously refunded my shipping fee, which was large.  I then received the second crib and it was spotless.  The delivery man from Seko Worldwide said that they hear complaints on this a lot and blamed the air carrier that flies the boxes out to the ground shipping location. I also emailed Storkcraft about what happen and the other negative reviews, they offered to send a replacement piece for the broken piece (but no mention about the dented/chipped piece) and then proceeded to place the blame on the retailer.  I was not impressed. 

I was willing to take my chances on the reorder and was one of the fortunate customers who recieved an unmarked crib.  I put it together myself, all the parts were accounted for and the drawer works great.  I only bought this for the price and the convertable feature but will not buy Storkcraft in the future.  "

Kaufman,"Brooklyn, NY United States","I bought this chair used and I don't think it's worth the $50 I paid for it. I also have the Fisher Price chair  (I have twins) and that one is SO much better - I wish I had 2 of those. First, like everyone has said, it is ridiculous to clean. Those people who said it's easy to clean must either not be really cleaning it or have babies that make very little mess. Gross food particles collect in every crease and corner, especially under the seat. 

Most importantly, the tray is way too high - even at 1 yrs old my girls are uncomfortable reaching food on it and they are an average height/weight. The tray also doesn't come close enough so there is a big gap between the baby and the chair - not dangerous but perfect for all the food to fall through and collect in the sides of the chair and on the lap.

Finally, the tray is too big for an average size dishwasher so must always be washed by hand. The FP high chair tray can go right into the dishwasher.

ONLY BUY THIS CHAIR IF THE ONLY THING YOU CARE ABOUT IS HOW IT LOOKS"

Our son is 20 months old and I still have to put a book wrapped in a dishtowel in the seat so he can comfortably reach the tray or our dining table.  Raising the height doesn't help because the arms of the chair come up so high and so far forward you can't scoot the chair in any closer to a table.  The chair also has a very large footprint--unless you have a very spacious dining area it's hard maneuvering around it.  If I could do it over again, I wouldn't buy this high chair"

I mentioned this to my friend with an 8 month old the other day and she said the same exact thing happened to hers - just stopped working reliably. She's bought a different monitor too.  Both of our new monitors are working perfectly now with less static.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing this monitor until they make some changes."

It seemed perfect for my 1 yr old daughter. The mesh back would be ideal for the hot, humid weather. It's light and easy to travel with. It seemed sturdy. Most of this was true until I used it for a month. Honestly, the seat is way too big! My daughter was forever uncomfortable b/c the straps were too loose even at their tightest to hold her and the seat was too deep. With minimal padding (and no recline) she would bump her head on the side frame when riding around. And to top it off, the frame bent after basic use. All we did was take it in and out of the car! I was very disappointed. Maybe this would be a great stroller for a 4 year old, but don't buy this stroller b/c you're looking for something smaller than your Graco(but better than an umbrella stroller) for your young toddler. I think for the price and minimal features it should be of better quality. Every review mentioned the carrying strap b/c that's the ONLY extra feature! This stroller was not for us! "

Ingram,,"I read all the Amazon reviews but still decided to go with the Avent sippy cup since I had relatively good experiences with the Avent bottles. Unfortunately, leaking is a real problem with these cups. Not only does the milk seem to pour out of the sides no matter how well I try to fasten the lid, but it does not flow easily for my son when he sips. He ends up with a mouth full of milk. So much for my efforts to get him to start using a cup. I orginally used Playtex and he liked that well enough. I only switched because the Playtex valve was hard to clean and easy to tear. Now, after wasting money on Avent, I'll go back to Playtex and hopefully my son will be willing to give sippy cups another try. I don't usually write Amazon reviews but I figured it was worth it in this case to save someone else the trouble. Unless you want milk EVERYWHERE, I would definitely avoid these cups."

He also can get his arms out of the top. If the velcro strip could be larger, going more toward the back and side of the product, this would not happen. Maybe my son is more narrow at the top than some children and this is not a problem for many, but I think this would make the product more useable, one size fits all. Also, he is long, and the small size was too cramped. I'm assuming the next size up would have been too wide for him and therefore making it impossible for his arms to stay inside - which is happening anyway.

Getting it back into it's ""bag"" was such a hassle I used to just plunk the thing back into the backseat of the car after shopping... which made the convienent small-space self storage a waste of time and money.  This thing is named well, as it really is floppy- floppy to put into the cart and floppy to try to put away again.  

I started reading reviews of other seat covers, trying to find a better option and I sure found it!  I was really hesitant at the price of the Buggy Bagg, but I could tell when I took it out of the box that it was worth the extra money!  I've only had the Buggy Bagg for 3 days and I am already thrilled that I spent the money on it... definitely worth the extra $20!  It is super-well padded and can really, truly be put into the cart with ONE HAND!  (The Floppy Seat needs at least two hands to go well into the cart!)

DON'T waste your money on the Floppy Seat- it's a flop of a product! "

Indeed, it's a floppy, illconceived mess.  It basically works but there is a much better option out there: the BuggyBag.  

This ""floppy"" is not an easy one hand install, it doesnt TOTALLY protect the child as A) one belt feeds through to hold baby and cart allowing unnecessary contact (not ALL covers do that as one reviewer proposes) and B)because it doesnt install in one clean drop and doesnt fold into the carrying shape neatly you and baby are in contact with both floppy sides of this floppy mess as you try to flop it in and out of the cart and your car.

After trying the Floppy mess and a MISERABLE seat called the Shop'n'Dine, I've found the BuggyBag to be the perfect solution:  Truly a neat one hand install; easy zip back into its carrying shape; 2 belts (one for baby, one for cart) neat and simply storage options.  (Read my AMApedia article)  

Dont take my word for it, go to a big Baby store and try out both.  Just standing there you'll see that there's no comparison.  I'm... shocked that there are people who liked the Floppy, but SURE they never tried the BuggyBag."

However, I find it very difficult to manage.  

I see that the previous reviewer said that she puts it in the cart with one hand -- I say kudos to her because I find it extraordinarily difficult to hold my almost-20 lb. baby in one hand and put the floppy seat in the cart with the other!  The elastic keeps it on when it's on, but it also makes it so that you have to physically stretch it over the sides of the cart... I challenge you to do it with one hand!

Also, I think that the act of strapping the baby in can be dangerous. I am trying to hold him in the seat with one hand and feed the strap through the tiny hole in the back of the floppy seat with the other... you have to really be aware of what your baby is doing because at that point s/he is not strapped in and can easily fall out.

All of that being said, once baby is properly ""installed"", it does make for a convenient trip down the grocery aisles"

Needless to say, I have lots of experience in the stroller world.  This was my first Peg Perego stroller purchase as I have used Graco and Maclaren in the past.  I had been using my Maclaren umbrella stroller (which I purchased in 2000 when my first son was 6 months old) and thought I would buy a new stroller since the other was a bit old.  My girlfriend recommended the Aria so I purchased it.  Anyways, it was a huge disappointment.  The steering is AWFUL.  You definately need TWO hands for this stroller.   The stroller is also extrememly ""wobbly"".  I was shocked as I figured such an ""upscale"" brand would be quality enough not to wobble so much.  The 5 point restraint is hard to stay in place as the back straps are attached into a little ""envelope"" type holder but it always comes out as there is no device to actually secure it in place.  It is bulky in that it doesn't fold into a small compact stroller.  I used this 3 times and just gave it away...what a waste of $$. I'm back to using my Maclaren, which looks thrashed but is a wonderful stroller.  I could kick myself for wasting the money.  My advice to you is TEST it out before you buy it!!!(don't rely on the name"

We bought this stroller per the recommendation of a friend of ours.  We have the sable color, which I see is not sold this year... but I digress.  We have been using this stroller for eight months with our eight month old and are absolutely fed up with it.

My biggest complaint is the steering.  The front wheels slide sideways over any smooth surface and if we're not on a smooth surface, it feels like I am pushing the stroller into a brick wall because they don't rotate to allow me to push the stroller forwards.  I am always backing up and turning in order to get the front wheels to align so I can get where I want to go.  Shopping is a joke with this stroller because I cannot get it to navigate the aisles easily.

The shoulder straps are attached to the back of the stroller with a little plastic tab which, really, doesn't seem like the best way to keep a child's shoulders restrained.  It ends up coming out from the tab holder and my son is virtually only wearing a lap belt.  This is fine now that he is able to handle a 3 point instead of a 5 point harness but when he was younger, this got on my nerves.

The adult cup holder is a joke, so we took it off and my son figured out how to take the kid's cupholder out so it doesn't stay in any longer as well.

Oh, and the thing folding down so that the handlebar catches the sunshade complaint is spot on.  SO FRUSTRATING!  Not a big deal, really, but poor design because the sunshade prevents the handlebar from locking the folded up stroller in the folded up position most of the time.

I just remembered also, that the sides of the padding in the seat area, when I used this stroller with our Graco Snugride car seat,  would bunch up and prevent the car seat from sitting securely.  I would have to prop the edges of the padding in the seat area underneath the arm-rests of the seat area (the parts that say Aria) before I put the car seat into the stroller seat area so that it would sit deep enough to latch onto the cup area and allow the security strap to go over the carseat snugly.

If Peg Perego could fix the steering, I think I would be able to live with the rest of my complaints but the steering factor is enough for me to trash the whole 9 pound thing now that I found another stroller that steers so much easier with my 22 pound 8 month old son"

Casel ""West Chester PA Mom""","West CHester, PA United States","After reading the reviews this sounded like an easy choice.  I was VERY wrong.  When I first plugged it in I could not believe how quickly the wipes heated.  I thought it was great.  I did think they were way too hot after they were in a while... but a quick shake after I pulled one out cooled it down enough to make it safe.  Then a few days later I was pulling them out and the inner lid popped open... and kept popping open with every change.  THEN when I lifed the unit to put new wipes in... my $700 changing table / dresser was flooded and warped! ( I had it replaced!!)   I had not known it because the pad and a basket were on the table, too.  Same problems kept happening. So I called Combi...Customer Service told me the Instruction Manual states that the wipes are to be left in the packaging.  She said that the excess moisture which caused the flooding would be held by the packaging.  Of course I could not measure the amount of fluid... but I am not exaggerating when I say CUPS!  Even if it did hold the CUPS of water.. so when the plastic pacaking is empty and no longer has wipes,  it is filled with excess cups of moisture and then you have to remove that to dispose of it???? And although it is stated... a) there should be a warning to NEVER use wipes not in a package and b) WHY!  I bought a large ""bag"" of Huggies wipes.. there is no package to pop in.
Second... she told me that the unit is not supposed to stay plugged in all the time.. and that this too, is in the Manual.  So I lookeed at that, too.  Not in the ""Usage"" part.. but on the back under ""Cautions"" it states this:  ""Unplug power cord when not in use"".  Okay.... when you have a newborn.. when are you NOT using your wipes.. LOL!  She said it should be plugged in and unplugged several times a day to keep them warm!!!  I guess a new mom is supposed to schedule that! AND... if that was an acceptable property of the product.. shouldn't there be a switch??  I would have to move the dresser every time.. or get an extention cord, of course!  Crazy! 
Combi gave me, what I consider, ridiculous answers.  They also need to get real when they write the Manual.  
For the record.. I have written a review one other time to rave about my Little Bissell.  This frustrated me so much I HAD to share the info.!!!!!!  Also.. this is baby #4 so I am quite familiar with baby products. "

After a few weeks, she began crying alot.  You could hear the gas moving in her tummy, and every time her tummy would grumble, she would pull her legs up and shriek in pain.  She would also pass gas constantly.  It was so difficult to feed her because she would cough, spit and cry the whole time. Then she would be miserable with gas pains for hours afterwards.  I tried switching formulas - didn't work.  Tried mylicon, Zantac, gripe water, bicycling her legs, etc. etc. etc... nothing worked.  The pediatrician diagnosed her with colic and said there was nothing we could do, that she would outgrow it.  Finally, we decided to switch bottles (I switched to Playtex nursers.)  Instantly we noticed a difference!  She was extremely quiet during feedings, didn't squirm or cry!  She began ingesting almost TWICE as much formula per feeding(probably because her tummy was too full of gas to take in any more with the Avent bottles!) and would go longer between feeds. And when she swallowed, it sounded different - you could tell that she was no longer swallowing air!  Something about those Avent bottles made her swallow tons of air.  I think it was the suction that was created inside the bottle as she ate.  With the Playtex nursers, the liner inside the bottle contracts as she eats, eliminating any air bubbles.  She is a completely different baby now.  She is more alert and interacts with us much more because she spends less of her awake time crying.
So if you decide to buy these bottles - BEWARE.  If you are already using them and your baby has colic, switch immediately!  Don't just assume that colic is ""normal"" or will be ""outgrown.""  Babies don't deserve to suffer this way!!!"

They instead tended to bend towards the center of the male end of the buckle causing it to slip out of the female end of the buckle which then caused the car seat to fall off the luggage.

I think it's safe to say that we have an ambivalent relationship with the Volo, not including my 12 month old daughter who would give it a definite thumbs down.
On the up side it is very light and folds easily and is compact. Not to mention that everyone gets to see you have a Maclaren stroller in a wonderful shade of orange. The stroller is great for the airport and quick shopping trips when you are in and out of the car.
We first purchased the volo without springing for the seat pad. This was a mistake as our daughter was clearly uncomfortable and was unwilling to spend significant time in the stroller. The seat pad did increase her comfort level but she still grows tired of the volo much more quickly than her larger stroller. I think this has to do with the fact that she is not very upright in the volo and cannot shift much in the seat as it offers no support. On top of it, the velcro on the seat pad becomes unhinged each time you fold the stroller - a minor annoyance but a hassle all the same. The awning offers very little sun protection. The mesh cargo area holds very little and is difficult to access. On top of that, you need to empty it completely in order to fold the stroller.
When it comes to travel the volo leaves much to be desired. With limited cargo room, it becomes quite unstable if you hang anything on the handles. It has no recline making it difficult for children to sleep well - a problem when you want to spend the day wandering. Further, while it is great to have such a lightweight stroller when getting it in and out of the car, riding escalators and getting on and off the bus, the Volo flounders once you get off well-paved surfaces. We encountered potholes, dirt paths, cobblestones and sand in our tavels and the Volo was a disaster. The wheels would spin erratically and catch in large divets and gutters. Locking the front wheels so they would not swivel provided little relief. Cobblestones were particularly disastrous as the stroller was so hard to manage and such an uncomfortable ride that we ended up carrying both the child and the volo.
If I had to do it over, I would opt for a compact stroller that weighs a bit more but offers larger wheels, easy-access storage and a supported reclining seat"

However, once I received the bumper, I realized it clearly does not work with cribs with a solid headboard.  Upon writing customer service at breathable baby for advice on how it would fit, I was told the following:

""The Breathable Bumper will wrap if your crib has a space on either side of the corner posts. If it does, wrap around the outside of the posts. If the Breathable Bumper won't fit your crib you should try the CribShield which has four separate pieces so you can eliminate the foot and head board pieces and just use the long rail sides. Look online and see that the crib must have straight railings and not too thick so the padded rail cover can fit and attach over it."" 

When I responded that this information was basically too little too late, and that it disagreed with what they said in their FAQ's, I was then told:

""The other option moms have been doing is buying 2 Breathable Bumpers and using the short pieces on front and back rails. This way they have the padding. In the future, we will be selling them as a package that way, but for now you can still have the safety and comfort you desire.""

I think it's really poor customer service to mislead the customer into buying an item and then tell them in order to make it work, they need to purchase a different item or more of the same.  Customer Service at Breathable Baby has since removed the misleading FAQ, however, I now am inconvenience with returning the item.

Pallaci,NY,"I used this when I became too sore to use my electric pump.  The milk seeps under the pump guard and it leaks out from the edges onto clothes. I wouldn't even say getting this as a pump for when you're on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up. I had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing (which it says you can do).   They don't sell just that one little piece so I had to buy the actual pump again as a part.  It cost nearly $30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it.  The entire system just isn't durable or made for much use.  Also, cleaning down into the bend of this pump thoroughly is practically impossible."

That I cannot deny.  Our two+ week old little girl seems to love it and seems to sleep for longer stretches on it without waking.  However, the trade off in better sleep is NOT worth the risk.  I woke up last night to find that she had slipped down and her face was right between the bolsters.  She could have easily suffocated!  This is a very common complaint with this product (both here on Amazon's web site as well as on Target's web site where there are many parents who have reporting having the same scary moment that I had).  Some reviews seem say that if you have a real squirmy older baby that that is the true problem with this product.  I have to tell you that that is not quite the case.  Our little two week old is tightly swaddled at night and doesn't move a whole lot - yet she slipped down to a position where she could have suffocated.  The bolsters were very tight to her sides and so that doesn't explain things either.  If you choose to purchase this product, please be very careful with it.  I understand that those of you who have infant with reflux don't really have a choice about this but I recommend that you try it first in the daytime with your infant closely supervised so you can see if they are likely to slip down.  As for us, we may try to keep using it by elevating the bottom a little with a blanket underneath but we are absolutely getting rid of the bolsters. "

Initially it looked great, seemed very sturdy and we thought he would love being able to sit and play with his toys.  However, getting him in and out we noticed that the plastic edges around where his legs go is actually very sharp, and as our baby is on the tall end of the spectrum, it was impossible to get him in and out of the seat without scraping up his little legs and knees. 

It's not as if he is going to get any shorter, so I don't think there is any solution to the problem.  I think Safety 1st could have done a better job of making the plastic in that area more comfortable, or even put some padding at that location.  I'm surprised more reviewers didn't have this problem.  For our baby, who normally loves bathtime, it was a painful and frightening experience.

We will be returning the item.  Since you can't leave your baby unattended in water anyway, we might as well just get a non-slip mat and hold him until he gains more balance.  I recommend you save your money on this one"

Unless you have lots of space between your cabinet and your oven unit you will have trouble even getting this thing to stick.

I finally fenagled it into place, sticking the first piece to the side of the oven, then applied the part that goes across the front and latched it in place.  Upon opening the oven door with very, very, very little force (I just barely cracked the door open) the latch teeth snapped open, as if the latch wasn't even there.  Tried several times, even sort of holding the teeth, and no luck.  In the trash it went.

I also tried another lock also from Safety first that seems like it would work great - it has a heavy duty hinge, but the half of the lock with the adhesive surface too short so that there is not enough length on the adhesive edge to adequately anchor it to your oven and still have the hinge lock in place - and the hinge locks in place at less than a 90 degree angle.  So this left the latch anchored with only about 1/4"" of the adhesive strip on the oven.  Pop - off it came when I tried to open the door.  In the trash it went as well.

I'm very concerned about oven safety for my little guy and completely disappointed in the options out there for ovens.  :"

Really can't see that they even light up unless it's very dark out.

I do see the other reviewer's point about it being a safety issue because you kind of get obsessed with watching your baby and you should keep your eyes on the road. However, it never obstructed my view at all. 

I registered for this because of the remote control feature. Well, the remote control only turns the unit on and off and you have to keep the switch on the unit ""on"" (remote control access mode) in order for it to work.  There's a switch on the unit to play music OR turn the lights on and play music. You cannot control that feature from the remote control. You also cannot control the volume from the remote.
