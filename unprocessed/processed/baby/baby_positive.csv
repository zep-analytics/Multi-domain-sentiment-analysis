Bruno,"Orange, CA USA","I got this when my daughter was 4 months old.  She would sit in it for about 5 minutes, then want to get out.  But now that she is 6 1/2 months, she loves this and stays in it for about 30+ minutes and just entertains herself.  She has great coordination now and she loves to smack and grab the toys, and she coos at the little sun and loves to pull on everything and put it in her mouth.  When we go to family functions or just to someone's house, we always grab the entertainer.  It is very easy to break down and put right back together (if it doesn't fit in the car).  This by far is the best toy that she enjoys and LEARNS from.  She is quite tall for her age, 27 1/4 inches and we still have 2 more height adjustments on this.  This is the best $$$$ we have spent so far"

At first, he seemed a little intimidated by the toys, and would cry when I put him in it.  Once he got used to it, he really enjoyed it.  

Now he plays with all the toys, and he likes that it wobbles around.  His favorite toy seems to be the sun and the counting beads.  

I did not experience the problem with the feet that others wrote about.  Just lucky I guess.

The seat is really hard to remove for washing, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of "

We have to limit the time our son spends in it because he'd jump for hours on end if we didn't limit him to 5-10 minutes a day.  The Jumperoo has sturdy construction, and the 4 settings are useful.  I was a bit concerned about the coils inside the fabric because I was afraid that our son would get his fingers pinched when he held it, but he's been fine.  He doesn't play with the toy attachment.  I think this is a much safer alternative to the jumpers that hang from the door frame"

It seems safer than the doorway jumper, mainly because their fingers won't get mushed.  I like that it has multiple height settings and that it's on a sturdy frame.  They love to jump in it, and before they were able to crawl, it was one of the few ways for them to get out some of that excess energy and get some exercise.  Plus, it's a nice safe place for times when I'd like to get something done without having to keep a constant eye on one of the babies.  

The cons (that wouldn't keep me from buying it again) are: it takes up more room than a doorway jumper, the rattly bear is pretty loud, and the music is obnoxious.  There is an on-off switch and two volume settings for the music, though"

My daughter really relaxes with the Lavender scent wash and lotion and we used the Menthol wash when she had a cold.

Pourreza,maryland,"I picked this monitor after reading many reviews.  The reviews didn't lie.  This monitor does great on distance.  I have a 2400 sq ft home that has 3 floors.  The bedrooms are on the 3rd floor and most of my housework ended up on the 2nd floor.  I can have this on while vacuuming and still hear my son cry or even move around when he would wake up and not make a sound.  I could hear him grunt even!  I don't know why the one review mentions a 15ft signal loss.  You're given many channels in order to find the right strength.  I could go outside of my home and walk approximately 10 ft away from the garage door and still have signal (he was on opposite end of house upstairs).  I also took the receiver in the shower a couple of times, not getting it soaked.  Also like the voice activated portion but that only works if the room or surrounding area has no sound (no radio or tv or mobile playing).  Great product, strongly recommend.  My son is now 5 months old and the monitor still works great.  This monitor is the right choice for the average household.  Interference may come if you're on the same channel. I have wifi network, cordless digital phones and nextels and do not have any interference with this monitor so others just don't know how to resolve thier issue before blaming the product"

I don't really like to use the voice-activated mode but my husband does and says it works great.  When in the normal mode, I can hear little birds outside my baby's window and cars passing our house; it's quite sensitive!

It's very easy to switch from/to any stroller (less than 1 minute). When we visited relatives in Canada at Xmas, I installed the bundleMe on the infant car seat and it kept her warm during our trek from the airport to the parking spot. In San Diego one fall day, when she went down a slide at the park that was still wet, she ended up wearing only a diaper but the BundleMe kept her warm as we walked back home. Never had to worry about losing a blanket on the road, or having enough blankets to keep baby warm, or whether her feet were sticking out of the blankets, lost a shoe/sock, etc.  I am now using the same bundle me with my second child.

I had to post a review responding to her review because this book has tons of information on skin and scalp conditions in the table on pages 404-412, which talks about everything from impetigo to eczema. The information on teething is a bit more meager. I agree that this is something that the author needs to expand upon in the next edition of this book. But I still think this is an outstanding baby book. It provides tons of information and is reassuring and contains just the right amount of humor to keep you reading at a time in your life when it's hard to find the time or energy to read."

It felt like a big commitment for me to have to run the program 2 times a day, and near the end of my pregnancy I was annoyed with having anything strapped across my belly, but I am so glad I pushed through.  My daughter is AMAZING!  I am in awe at her sweet spirit and her advancement.  Baby Plus did everything it promised and more!  Here are some examples:

At birth: eyes wide open, hands open, instant excellent nurser, slept 4-6 hours at night, very calm and happy, cried only when hungry.
At 1 month: smiling all the time at everyone, sleeping 8-10 hrs. at night., recognized mom and dad's faces.
At 2 months: laughing, holding head up
At 3 months: pressing buttons on toys for 6mos +, rolling both directions, holding own bottle
At 4 months: sitting with support
At 5 months: sitting without support, drinking from sippy cup, singing, saying first words
At 6 months: puts self to sleep, pulled self to standing position, creeping... and now almost crawling.

I am completely amazed at her advancements.  People mistake her for being 3-6 months older than she is, and they say she is the happiest baby they have ever known.

I am totally sold on Baby Plus"

I was disappointed that I wasn't able to use it for my second pregnancy, most likely because it had been dropped too many times.  This new version comes with a cloth pouch that makes it MUCH MORE user friendly.  Also, one set of batteries (4 AA) lasted for 4-1/2 weeks.  The batteries in my old one would last 5 days IF I was lucky.  My daughter just turned two in January 06 and is extremely smart, verbally advanced and a joy to be around.  By 16 months she knew all of her colors and could recite the ABC's.  By 18 months she could recognize all of the letters.  I believe we are well on our way to having a reading child by the age of 3.

Her disposition has always been happy and eager to learn. She has great coordination  with activities and sports.
I am a nurse and I tell all my patients and friends about the BabyPlus system.
I am pregnant with my second child and there was no question at all that I would use the BabyPlus system again.

It has been the best yet for us.  From infant stage to now 6 months old, my daughter has fit snugly.  As an infant, the sling is perfect because you can't immerse the baby while the stump is still attached.  We used the tub on the counter by the bathroom sink, which worked very well while she was in the hammock stage.  Once her stump fell off, and she was able to control her head well, we lowered the bottom half of the hammock into the tub and let baby's bottom rest in the nook that is created between the hump and the top part of the tub.  A perfect angle for baby to rest comfortably while getting a bath.  This is the position in which we currently use our tub.  Now, however, we bathe her in the Aquarium tub instide the bathtub so we don't have to worry about where the water lands.  Finally, once baby is old enough to sit without support, we'll remove the sling altogether and let her sit in the wide end of the tub to play during bath time.

Bruno,"Orange, CA USA","I got this when my daughter was 4 months old.  She would sit in it for about 5 minutes, then want to get out.  But now that she is 6 1/2 months, she loves this and stays in it for about 30+ minutes and just entertains herself.  She has great coordination now and she loves to smack and grab the toys, and she coos at the little sun and loves to pull on everything and put it in her mouth.  When we go to family functions or just to someone's house, we always grab the entertainer.  It is very easy to break down and put right back together (if it doesn't fit in the car).  This by far is the best toy that she enjoys and LEARNS from.  She is quite tall for her age, 27 1/4 inches and we still have 2 more height adjustments on this.  This is the best $$$$ we have spent so far"

She's now [...] and it's in storage, but she was using it until she was about [...]  I like that the height is adjustable, the springs are covered, and the seat comes out easily to wash it.  (It was a poop-eroo for us too.)

A few things that I learned using this though is:
The blue spinning toy doesn't come out and yucky stuff can collect underneath it.  It is incredibly hard to clean.
The one that I got was a pain in the tush to get the batteries in, so once the batteries died, we set the kangaroo part aside.
My daughter's feet got rubbed raw when we first got this because she loved jumping in it.  I recommend using a pair of Robeez, or at very least a pair of socks, to protect their feet"

I was a bit concerned about the coils inside the fabric because I was afraid that our son would get his fingers pinched when he held it, but he's been fine.  He doesn't play with the toy attachment.

It is great to have way more of these necessities to start off with, that's months of not having to remember to buy any!

I love the bucket-thing this comes in - one currently holds all our bath stuff for easy toting to the bathroom.  The other one is our bib-holder, since we have a TON of bibs. It keeps them neat, all in one place and closes and can be put away for guests.  

The vapor bath is fantastic.  We just got over my son's first cold and it worked like a charm. He loves baths to begin with and this filled the whole bathroom with that soothing vapor and within minutes I could hear the difference in his breathing! When I caught the cold a few days later, I have to admit, I also took a vapor bath and it was better than a hot shower for clearing my congestion!

I don't know that the Lavendar one necessarily calms or soothes the baby, but it smells nice.  We've gotten shampoo in his eye at least once with no tears or fuss, so it must not burn. 

I definitely recommend getting this for new moms-to-be"

The bedrooms are on the 3rd floor and most of my housework ended up on the 2nd floor.  I can have this on while vacuuming and still hear my son cry or even move around when he would wake up and not make a sound.  I could hear him grunt even!  I don't know why the one review mentions a 15ft signal loss.  You're given many channels in order to find the right strength.  I could go outside of my home and walk approximately 10 ft away from the garage door and still have signal (he was on opposite end of house upstairs).  I also took the receiver in the shower a couple of times, not getting it soaked.  Also like the voice activated portion but that only works if the room or surrounding area has no sound (no radio or tv or mobile playing).  Great product, strongly recommend.  My son is now 5 months old and the monitor still works great.  This monitor is the right choice for the average household.  Interference may come if you're on the same channel.

From the very beginning, she has been an incredibly alert and interested baby.  She was born c-section at 38 weeks with eyes and hands wide open.  Once they were finished cleaning her up, my husband and I were thrilled to just cuddle her and talk to her while she looked at us both with wide eyes and made little coo coo sounds.  Right away she was great at nursing with a very good latch.  She rarely ever cried, and when she did, it was a quiet little ""lay lay lay"" sound, not the wild Waa-waa's.  

Throughout infancy she was always capable of adapting to every situation quickly and without emotional outburst.  Where it would seem other children would be over-stimulated in an environment, she would thrive and seem to want more stimulation!  At only three months of age, people thought she was older because of her alertness and interest in people and animals.  She hit every developmental milestone months early, especially in language (sign and speech), music appreciation, and colors/shape/letter/number recognition.  Her pediatrician has been happily surprised by her and suggested that I should have five more just like her! 

When we bought the BabyPlus, we thought, ""if it helps only 10% as well as the testimonials say it does, it will be worth it"".  We're certain it has contributed positively in helping develop this little miracle of ours.  We're now expecting child #2 (25 weeks along) and although not using the Baby Plus could be an interesting experiment (same gene pool, same parenting, etc.), we're too interested in the possibilities of how much it may contribute to our next child for us to withhold it.

Altman ""gocheapbooks""",suburbs of new york city,"ok so how many people think their baby is exceptional? Well, pretty much everyone i know, and they are all right of course.  Each baby is exceptional, in their own way.  But how many babies are rated as exceptional by pediatricians, nurses and early childhood educators?  Well, I know one - MINE!  I faithfully used the babyplus system when I was pregnant.  One time when using it, he started knocking back. Yeap, i actually felt him knock back at it, in rhythm.  It only happened once, but I told my husband that i think this is going to be one special kid.  I was about 7 months pregnant then.  Well, lo and behold, after he was born people (professionals) don't stop telling us how amazing he is.  He is the most aware newborn you will ever meet.  He is 2 months old now, and has been sleeping through the night (11 hours at a time) since he was 2 weeks.  He cries when he needs something, and never cries for no reason (but i do make sure to respond quickly to his needs so i don't know how much that has to do with it.).  Yesterday he started reaching for objects.  Can't quite grab them yet, but it doesn't stop him from trying. The pediatrician and the nurse remarked how incredibly physically strong he is, how aware he seems and the fact that he vocalizes to music is unheard of at this age.  He's been holding his head up since the day he was born (3 days late) and has been making eye contact since about 2 weeks.  So, i don't really know what if anything the baby plus system had to do with it.  I mean it could be just an accident but... all I can say is that I will definitely use this product with our future children.  I would pay thousands if i had to (and we are not rich people) because its worth every penny"

It felt like a big commitment for me to have to run the program 2 times a day, and near the end of my pregnancy I was annoyed with having anything strapped across my belly, but I am so glad I pushed through.  My daughter is AMAZING!  I am in awe at her sweet spirit and her advancement.  Baby Plus did everything it promised and more!  Here are some examples:

At birth: eyes wide open, hands open, instant excellent nurser, slept 4-6 hours at night, very calm and happy, cried only when hungry.
At 1 month: smiling all the time at everyone, sleeping 8-10 hrs. at night., recognized mom and dad's faces.
At 2 months: laughing, holding head up
At 3 months: pressing buttons on toys for 6mos +, rolling both directions, holding own bottle
At 4 months: sitting with support
At 5 months: sitting without support, drinking from sippy cup, singing, saying first words
At 6 months: puts self to sleep, pulled self to standing position, creeping... and now almost crawling.

I am completely amazed at her advancements.  People mistake her for being 3-6 months older than she is, and they say she is the happiest baby they have ever known.

I am totally sold on Baby Plus"

Another side has a picture of some bananas with a clear plastic over them to make for an interesting texture and yet another side contains a circle motif.
-The red block rattles, has a picture of a robin (?) on the one side, a square pattern motif on another side, and a picture of strawberries on another.
-The green block has a frog with 3D legs and the one leg is a pull toy that will cause the block to shake.  It also has a picture of a green apple (mine does, at least, although this picture shows a leaf), a silky fabric with leaf prints, and a triangle motif.
-The blue block is another rattle.  It has a picture of the BE turtle on one side, some jeans made from real denim on another, and a star motif on another.
-All blocks have a side with the color's name (I bought mine at Target, and they have the name in english, spanish, and french although these pictured only show it in English).  The rest of the sides are filled with textured fabrics such as a soft, fluffly fur or a bumpy texture (like the material found on the bottom of some slippers to prevent skidding).
My three month old loves to look at these blocks and I rub the different sides against her skin while saying ""soft"", ""smooth"", or ""bumpy"" and she loves the feelings.

Andreas,"Southington, CT United States","I have recently had my FIFTH child and so I have experienced many baby items, including swings, and this one is the BEST!  It has a cushiony, comfy seat for baby with different recline options; soothing lights and mobile for baby to have something to look at; several musical tunes with adjustable volume control.  There is also a dial to set the swing motion -- to go slowly or faster -- and the best feature of all is that this cradle swing can be changed to swing side to side, or front to back.  Sometimes we put our baby in swinging front to back, and she'll cry -- we then change the swing position to go side to side, and she immediately stops crying and starts to fall asleep.  And vice versa, sometimes we put her in side to side, and she wants to swing front to back -- how great to have that option so she can swing whatever way she's in the mood for!  As my husband says, ""this is the best money we've ever spent!"

I have the Chicco Key-Fit infant car seat and it fits just fine with the infant carrier bar in place, my baby slept in the car seat in the stroller all afternoon.  There is a nice seatbelt that goes over the infant car seat to hold it firmly in the stroller.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's a bit heavy/bulky, I hope I don't have any problems getting it in and out of my van.  I can't wait to try it out at the mall"

Newborns especially need a very soft surface for their very soft and malleable skulls.  We used it for our third baby and as a result, he has a perfectly round head and proportioned features.  The incline greatly reduced spit up as the 'flap' between their esophagus and stomach is not developed yet.  Gravity prevents the milk/formula from traveling back up and causing gas and or spit up.  I've noticed the biggest complaint about this item is that infants seem to slip down in it during the night.  This is true, however, rolling up a receiving blanket real tight and placing it in a ""U"" shape under our son's bottom prevented this from happening ever again.  As a result, he slept soundly, never spit up once, never woke us up with gas pain and has a perfectly round head.  I strongly recommend the Boppy Noggin Nest as well to keep the pressure off the head when your baby is not in his crib.  Also, if your baby is old enough to roll over, this item is not for you.  One other note: the foam wedges on either side do trap some body heat, so don't over-swaddle or put too many layers on...adjust the thickness of your blanket to the ambient temperature.  I would say this is a good item for newborns to about 5 months. It made an enourmous difference in the well being of our third child compared to his older twin siblings"

B000056JD6:so_far_so_good:frank_m,B000056JD6,Safeway Wall Mount Top of Stairs Gate: Baby,baby,14 of 14,4.0,So far so good,"September 12, 2005",Frank M,"Portland, OR","I just bought this one for the top of the stairs and a pressure mounted gate for the bottom of the stairs.  My first impressions is that a pressure mounted gate is fine for the bottom of stairs.  However, gates which attach to walls with screws are way more sturdy than even the best pressure mounted alternative.  

We considered this model and the Evenflo ""Top of Stair Gate"".  After inspecting both gates in the store we opted for this one because the wood spindles on the Evenflo seemeed less sturdy and potentially prone to breaking.  If one of the spindles breaks you have to replace the entire unit.  Also, why take the chance with safety?  
 
Anyway, here are a few things to consider when installing this item: 
1. I took the advice of others and only used the template for the swing side hardware only.  This is a must do.  It would be a wall-damaging crapshoot to try to get both sides lined up exactly right using templates on both sides of the wall.  
2. Unless you are screwing the hardward into a banister and don't want to damage them by having screws go all the way through, use longer screws than the dinky 1/4"" to 1/2"" screws that are provided in the kit.  I went with 2"" screws for additional strength.  
3) Installation isn't that big of a deal.  Just take your time to avoid silly mistakes that result in extra holes in your walls.  I found the picture-based instructions at the back of the booklet far more useful than the word-based instructions at the front of the booklet.  It wasn't a five minute job but it was not hard at all.  

I'll be back in a few months to post my thoughts on the gate after it has had some wear and tear from our 11 months old son and our 100lb dog. "

Took us some time to screw the extension in and then to screw the supports in and then to mark it on the wall.  Took us over an hour.
     The Configure gate is on the pricey side.  We almost did not buy it.  But it has two different size extension pieces and you can bend and configure it to the space you need.  We use it at the bottom of our stairs and it bows out to give you an area so that the gate is not up against the stairs.

She can monitor her snack time, eating as much or as little as she needs. She loves carrying around a snack cup in one hand and a sippy cup in the other. 

The only reason I give it 4 stars, is because she has a tendency of keeping her hand in the flaps while walking around. This makes single Cheerios fall out here and there. But, nothing compared to giving her snacks in an open bowl. I've only used them on Cheerios so I can't comment on other snacks (she tends to choke on Goldfish so she only gets those while sitting in the high chair).

She hasn't tried taking off the lid like other reviewers, so that's not a problem for us (at least not yet). We use them all the time and I definitely recommend them"

Both my husband and I use New Native slings on a daily basis. We've been 'wearing' our daughter since day one and continue to now that she is three months. This helped me tremendously in getting to 'know' my baby. It allows me to be responsive immediately to her needs because I can read her cues before she gets to a full blown cry. It helps me accomplish tasks around the house and makes shopping/running errands easy. We do not even own the detachable infant carseats. I cannot imagine having to lug one of those things around! I feel like this had helped her transition from her womb environment to the outside world. It gives her a sense of security even in new situations. Unlike front facing carriers, she can turn her head into our chests if she feels insecure or overstimulated. There are endless benefits to 'wearing' your baby and I feel like this sling has made it incredibly easy for me and my husband to do so. There are no buckles or rings or fasteners, just slide it on. 
If at first you don't succeed, try again later. It may be more comfortable for you and baby at a different stage. Another tip, get moving! The motion is what soothes babies and brings them comfort. 
Again, baby wearing is such a wonderful thing. I suggest you read up on the benefits and find a sling/carrier that works well for you. 
We recommend this one to all new parents and have never had anyone complain"

I remember one particular instance when he was so wedged in there that I was panicked and thought he had suffocated. I was extremely happy when I discovered this one for my 1 year old daughter that transitioned to a big bed. She is now two and I haven't had one problem with it. I at one point had three on her bed. I went down to two as I pushed her bed up against the wall which only left 2 sides open. I have not had one problem with them. I take them off her bed and use them when we travel. I can sleep at night not worrying that she is going to fall inbetween. I wish they had these when my son was younger :

That meant we needed to make sure he continued to be as safe in this bed as he was in his crib.  We opted for the Sure Position N Lock Bedrail.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars mostly because it really does Lock into its Position and stay there.  The weird thing about it, however, is that the pressure bars ""POP!"".  You'll get the rail in place on the bed, push down on the pressure bars so that they show 'green' to indicate they're locked... then after a while they'll go ""POP!"" and begin to inch their way UP into the 'red zone', meaning ""unlocked"".  It's weird!  It doesn't seem to get to the point where the rail is loose on his bed, but it's a loud noise that, until he was used to it, would wake him out of a dead sleep.  All in all, I DO recommend this bedrail for toddlers moving into big beds.  It's been a great source of safety and roll-out-of-bed prevention and it's given my husband and me much peace of mind at night"

The first few times I used it, I considered switching to an electric pump because I wasn't pumping much milk. But the more I pumped, the more milk I produced. This breastpump is worth every penny.

The seat has worked wonderfully from age 5 months to now age 21 months.  I do find the seat hard to recline or sit up but I have only had to do that a handful of times as once you find the right setting for your child it stays there until he/she is ready for the next setting.  The cloth lining is very easy to remove, wash, and put back and the plastic under the seat cover is easy to wipe clean.  The tray is easy to put on, remove and again wipe clean or wash off in the sink.  I have also found the seat easy to take on and off the dining chair when I need the chair for entertaining others.  My daughter has never complained about sitting in the seat and, now that we are no longer using the tray but still using the seat as a booster, enjoys having her own place at the table.  I highly recommend this seat for parents looking to conserve space in their dining areas but not sacrifice convenience or comfort. "

B000I5UZ1Q:baby_and_i_like_this_swing:elviswoman,B000I5UZ1Q,Fisher-Price Starlight Papasan Cradle Swing: Baby,baby,5 of 5,4.0,Baby and I like this Swing,"January 25, 2007",elviswoman,"Dallas, TX United States","I recently received this swing as a gift for my 2 month old preemie.  She LOVES the lights, the rotating stuffed animals, and the sounds.  And she seems comfortable in the seat too.  The seat snaps into two positions, a reclined position and a sitting position.  Additionally, you can set the swing up to go from side to side or forward and backward.

I did have an incident last week where we had some power surges here in the neighborhood WHILE we were using this swing.   When the power came back on, I tried all the different switches to turn it on and it didn't work, then later on, it finally did work.  This swing has so many switches on it and I admit to being too lazy to read the instructions for all of the functions that each of the switches perform.  That said, I don't know if the failure was user error or a quality issue.  It appears to be functioning just fine as of this writing so I think it was me.

Another user cites instability of the stand on this swing.  I have had no problem with this as I tested it carefully before putting baby in.  Also, we leave the swing set up in one place in our house all the time, so we haven't had have to worry about not opening the stand up all the way beyond the initial setup.  This might be more of a concern for someone who needs to put it away and take it back out a lot.

I personally like the fact that the mobile, the rocking, and the sounds are independent of each other, so you have a lot of variety to entertain baby with.  I LOVE the fact that you can use batteries OR the wall outlet to power this thing.  Thank GOODNESS for not being held hostage to battery manufacturers anymore, but having that option if we wanted to use it where electricity isn't available.

I would recommend this swing, but I would check for a reasonable return policy first before buying and keep the packaging for a couple of weeks after you receive it just to be sure you and your baby are happy with it"

Langley,"San Jose, CA USA","We received the original co-sleeper as a gift.  We also considered getting a mini co-sleeper and a pack'n'play or similar playard.

The main advantage of the co-sleeper is that you can attach it to your bed so you can reach your baby without getting up.  The original co-sleeper can also be used as a playard.  The playard capacity is up to 50 pounds, most brands are only rated to 30 lb.  Similarly the bassinet level rating is 30 lb. and most brands go to 15.  The co-sleeper itself is about 2 or 3 pounds heavier than a typical playard.  The width is 28"" so the co-sleeper can go through our 29"" doorways without collapsing, unlike several playards that are around 31"".

There is a trick to collapsing the top bars - you have to pull the bar upwards when you press the buttons, then it's easy.  (otherwise you can push until your thumbs are purple and nothing happens)  This is explained on their website and SHOULD have been included in the manual.

I had a lot of reservations after reading other reviews here but am glad I chose to keep the co-sleeper and expect it to use it constantly.  Also, the Arm's Reach canopy is really strong and beautiful and I'm confident it'll keep the cats out"

I have friends who used it and read all the amazing reviews so it was a no brainer.  We've run into a few problems:  First we have a modern platform bed that is low to the ground and even at it's lowest the co-sleeper is several inches to high so we've had to switch bed frames for now.  Second the co-sleeper mattress is rock hard and actually sits down about 4 inches from the divider- since I'm used to having him in my arms for night nursing I didn't want to have to reach in and pick him up.  We solved both of these issues by purchasing 2 portable crib mattresses.  Now he has a softer surface to snooze on and I can simply slide him over to nurse or roll myself right up to him... we'll have to remove one of the mattresses once he's a bit bigger so he doesn't fall out, but for now it works!  Hope this helps!

*** I'm adding this a few months after use- I like the idea of the extra space offered by having the co-sleeper attached to the bed, but our son is now 9 months old and has actually slept in it only a handful of times... still prefer to have him in the bed with us!"

I do have to add that directions were somewhat difficult to understand without going over them many, many times"

Gehring ""jogging mama""","Kentucky, USA","I replaced our old Ocean Wonders Aquarium soother with this Rainforest Waterfall version about a month and a half ago.  The Aquarium was still working and our baby liked the lights and music, but I was looking for something that would play for a longer period of time.  With the Aquarium, I had to go in her room and press the button a couple of times before she would fall back asleep.  Not fun at 3 or 4 in the morning when all I want to do is fall back asleep.  I had read that the Waterfall soother plays for up to 18 minutes, so I thought I'd check it out.

The soother has 3 different length settings: lights, music/sounds, and movement for 6 minutes; lights and music/sounds for 12 minutes; music/sounds only for 18 minutes.  There are 3 settings for the sounds: rainforest sounds without music; rainforest sounds and lullabies; rainforest sounds and classical music.  There are 3 volume settings as well.

I have ours set for 12 minutes of sounds and lullabies and I rarely have to go back in her room and press the button a second time.  She almost instantly settles down once the music starts.  If I happen to put her down for a nap or for bed while she's still awake, she'll quietly watch the lights and fall asleep on her own.  And I'll admit that hearing the songs and rainforest noises over the baby monitor is soothing and relaxing as I try to fall back asleep.

My only complaint is that the lights seem REALLY bright for something that is supposed to lull a baby to sleep.  I ended up covering ours with a light flannel blanket to dull the light a bit.  The baby can't see the critters, but since I don't have them set to move, it's not really a big deal.

Despite the bright lights, we're happy with this soother"

Overall very nice carseat for the money I spent.

We haven't had any problems with the operation of the swing, even as our little one has grown to her present weight of 18+ lbs. It runs on C batteries, which for us seem to last almost a month with moderate use.

This swing has several great features. It folds up very easily and really is as portable as claimed. It pops right in the trunk for trips to Grandma's house, and I've also used it quite a bit in the backyard when I want to do yard work. Having a 5 year-old in the house, I also appreciate being able to quickly carry it from room to room. Being only a flat 5 foot tall with short (and admittedly weak) arms, I have a lot of difficulty carrying the swing with the baby in it, but the swing is lightweight enough to carry one-handed while the baby's in the other arm.

Though I'm pleased with this swing, I'd really recommend it in *addition* to a traditional baby swing rather than instead of one. The compact nature of this swing means that the rocking motion is very fast-moving, unlike the slow, soothing motion of taller swings. My daughter seems to like the Take-Along Swing just fine when she's in an alert, awake mood. When she's tired, however, it just goes too quickly, even on the lowest setting, and seems to overstimulate her rather than calm her down. I'd originally purchased this with the idea of replacing our full-sized Graco swing, but we've ended up keeping both around as they seem to fill different needs. Overall, I'd certainly recommend this swing - but if you're only going to have one swing in your house, you might consider whether you'd be more grateful for a big swing that rocks your baby to sleep, or this little one that entertains during those fussy, bouncy times"

O'Brien ""Kathryn's Mom""","Spencer, MA","I recently purchased the Zooper Tango Sidy by Side Double Stroller.  I had done some looking at stores & extensive research online.  Suddenly, I found this on Amazon of all places.  The reviews were great & the price was right.  I bought it, a little hesitant that I hadn't gotten to test drive it.  

This stroller is great!  It fits through doorways, it's a little tight in an aisle, but we're talking about a double stroller here, it's going to be a little wide!  I have a 2 year old & 1 year old, so I do find that it veers to the side that my 2 year old sits on, just slightly.  It is heavier than the Peg Perego Aria is, but it feels much more solid.  Folds easily & somewhat compactly (again, it's a double stroller!).  It fits into the back of my Honda Odyssey with room for bags & whatnot.

I would recommend this stroller to anyone with twins or 2 little ones.  My 2 year old likes to ""nap"" (recline the seat) while we are walking.  The back zips off, she likes to look out the back.  A 5 point harness keeps everyone safe, but I find that I usually just use it as a waist seat belt.  

Storage is limited, my husband wants to customize the basket area - it sounded like his plans involved a hack saw...There is a spot for a bottle of water or misc items (a hanging net type basket - just big enough for a bottle of water) & a zip pocket on the back of the stroller.  However, if you unzip the back & remove it, you have lost this pocket.  I did read that McClaren has a stroller organizer for about [...] - we were planning on buying this to carry more stuff.

Overall, I do love our new stroller & would highly recommend it!"

Having a car seat that fits into both the base and the stroller allowed us to leave our sleeping daughter undisturbed when moving her in/out of the car.  Being off of work for 3 months, I didn't have to feel cooped at home when I could easily take my daughter to the store or the park.  As big as the stroller is compared to umbrella strollers, we still prefer to take it, because the diaper bag and other items fit easily underneath, the seat-back folds down (allowing sleep or diaper changes), and it has THREE cupholders, 2 side pockets that can hold other items (burp cloth, bottled water, toys), and a little compartment for sunglasses or cell phone.  The basket underneath is accessible hands-free by pressing up or down on the basket with your foot.  The stroller fits in the trunk of our compact Saturn 4-door, or if necessary, in the front passenger seat (upside-down to fit in the wide wheels, which are anyway relatively easy to remove).  The loaded stroller is easy to guide with one hand, so I can push it if I happen to be carrying my daughter.  The stroller is sturdy and smooth enough to take down the street, on paved park paths, and we always use it on the packed sand at the beach (it even works over the brief path over the unpacked sand, if you go backwards).  In her car seat in the stroller, she could get complete protection from the sun and light rain with the two canopies, although I found that a draped blanket allowed for more air flow.  We took the whole system on a 10-day trip, which included a flight out of town, and I felt like our load was lighter than those we took before our daughter was born.  At 6 months, she has just outgrown the car seat (but she's basically off-the-charts in her height/weight), but we still use the stroller now that she can sit up.

Drawbacks, all fairly minor:  Not easy to close stroller one-handed.  Wheels are wider than the carriage appears from the top, so I'm always banging the wheels on something.  It takes a few minutes to remove/replace washable carseat cover, but this is probably necessary due to the straps.  As with any carseat, we would suggest getting help by certified people with proper installation of the carseeat in your car; we had many questions on installation, particularly since our car lacked the LATCH system.  We purchased a second base so we didn't have to remove the one in our car for our trip or for our babysitter's car"

I just wanted something simple and strong that can get us out of the house quickly--we live in a very hilly, sort of rustic area, so I needed something I could take my son to the park in without hauling out the big buggy. This is really light, and it folds and has a carrying strap in case the boy wants to walk a bit. (There is also a storage bag for travel.)
 
The tires have treads on them, so they can handle steep terrain, and they give a pretty smooth ride over bumps. The fabric is sort of a thick canvas-sy polyester--not removable, but it seems like it could easily be scrubbed/hosed clean if necessary. The seat also has some padding and back support (although, on the con side, it's probably not the coolest compared to mesh). The weight limit is given as 37 lbs, so my 19-month old still has plenty of room to grow--his shoulders are comfortable and his feet don't reach the footrest yet (he is 27 pounds and about 33 inches tall). On the plus side, it seems bigger than the Wrangler All-Weather umbrella stroller, plus it reclines a bit (you unzip/unbutton the sides to allow the fabric to unfold), unlike the Volo. 

The square canopy is maybe not the greatest (it only covers the face, and could actually sit a little higher I think)--but as for everyone complaining that it falls off, I have found that when you flip the canopy to the back, if you then detach the back flap from the seat, you can  attach the side flaps to that velcro on the back to keep it from sliding off. 

Some people have also mentioned kicking the wheels, but I'm 5'6"" and haven't had any problems--I think it's a matter of not standing right on top of the thing since it's an umbrella stroller and doesn't have a superwide wheelbase. 

I would give it 4.5 stars I think, but am giving 5 because of the great price! I'm pretty happy with this--and my son is constantly trying to climb in, so he must like it too... I figure that with the money we saved, we can buy a nice Kettrike or some other form of transportation the boy can grow into."

We've never used the rain cover, so I can't comment on that.  It doesn't have a storage basket, but I don't know many umbrella strollers that do.  For longer trips, we just take our full size Combi stroller if we need the storage or full recline option.  I would definitely recommend this stroller for a light ""quick outing"" stroller to keep in the car. "

I just figured maybe I should have bought it a couple of months ago.  But, what I did was put one of his big blankets in it and laid him on top of it and whadduya know? He sleeps in it more than his swing now!  I guess it wasn't as cushiony as he wanted it to be.  I kind of noticed that too, when I got it that it appeared not to be as cushiony.  Another disappointing thing is that the music volume is a little loud even on the lowest setting, so I don't even use it.  Aside from that it's great.  The motor noise doesn't seem to bother me or my son.  It isn't very loud to me.  But anyway he sleeps in it, which allows me to get more me time and sleep time at night.

My only complaints are that there are just two short tunes that play alternatively and you have to press his belly fairly hard each time you want one to play.

While using the wrap isn't intuitive (ie watch the dvd) it's easy to learn.

My back problems are gone and baby is more snug in the wrap (tummy to tummy) than in traditional front carriers. I wanted to use the sling position but baby is too big length and width wise.

Only gripe is that there is no neck support in the tummy to tummy position so I have to hold baby's head while I rock her to sleep.

For folks who complain about leakage....the rare times that has happened to me was when I accidentally added milk past the top marker. Otherwise, I've never had a single problem with any sort of leakage.

Another plus is that they're very easy to clean; I just pop all the pieces into the top rack of the dishwasher (I use a toddler basket to hold some of the smaller pieces). 

If you're comparing the wide mouth to the standard, forget the standard! They're a pain to get liquid into (but still good bottles).

My baby was getting uncomfortable being swaddled at about three months, so we decided to make the switch to sleep sacks. We were worried that with her arms free that she might have a hard time falling and/or staying asleep. This was true at first so we started by only putting her in these during the daytime - in a light cotton one. After about a week she was not waking early from her naps anymore and after two weeks we tried her in it at night - and she slept straight through the night (as she did when she was swaddled). So the transition was painless and she seemed a much happier baby to be able to reach her hands and move her arms.

While I didn't notice shrinkage I did notice that the zipper does bunch up a bit, but this hasn't been a problem. Sometimes my daughter sucks on it if it gets close to her mouth, but she has to reach for it - it doesn't cover her face at all or trap air that she could rebreathe. 

I didn't like that these don't have sleeves so I tried Carter's sleep sacks and found the sleeves to be too short and hard to get on my daughter. Those sacks only come in one size which my daughter has already outgrown at four months (14 lbs, 24 inches). She has also outgrown the small size sleep sack, but the medium size fits her perfectly with some room to grow.

I didn't want to use fleece at first since it is polyester. I wanted to use cotton. But we've found that she sleeps longer and seems to prefer he heavier fabric of the fleece one.

Also, we only bought these in blue even though we have a girl because the color is calming to our easily overstimulated baby.

Watch for different size flanges.,"September 18, 2006",San Jose Mom,"San Jose, CA United States","I got this pump as a hand-me-down from my friend. It worked great even after many years... I eventually purchased the Pump In Style Advanced Limited Edition where the pump can be separated from the bag. It takes up less desk space (no extra space required for the bag). Also, it's more portable if all you need is the pump. I pump all over the house (study, bedroom, living room while watching TV with my husband).

Just a note to some people having problems getting milk out with the Medelas... It may not be the pump itself but the size of the flanges. Every woman's breast and nipples are different sizes. Initially, I was using the standard 24mm flanges (suction cup things that go over your breasts). It was painful to pump and my milk would not come out even though I was engorged with plenty of milk. It would take me 2 hours just to get 2 oz of milk! I went to see a lactation consultant who suggested I try the next size up flanges (27mm). She got me one to try and it made a world of difference. I could immediately pump 2oz in under 5 mins. Now, I pump daily to stock up and can get 4 oz from both breasts in under 10 mins (estimate since I don't really time it cause it's so fast).

I am now planning to pump to donate my milk to a milk bank. This pump made a world of difference.  I think Medela makes flanges in 3 different sizes. The standard 24mm that comes with all their pumps, the 27mm and a 30mm."

I went ahead with them because my sisters said they didn't have any problems with them.  They have leaked twice but only because I didn't screw the lid on all the way because my hands were wet.

"B000BMBU7O:overall_fantastic,_one_big_con_and_a_few_small_ones:a._thompson",B000BMBU7O,Baby Trend Baby Trend Flex Loc Infant Car Seat - Chatham: Baby,baby,,4.0,"Overall fantastic, one big con and a few small ones","April 9, 2007",A. Thompson,"Salt Lake City, Utah","I have had two kids use my Evenflo carseat.  I HATED it. It was like they never even tried it out to see how well its features worked.  I finally got so sick of it when my 2nd child was 4 months old that I ordered a Babytrend Flexloc.  At first I was seduced by the high safety ratings, but even after that Consumer Reports article was rescinded, I still liked a lot of the features.

Pros:
-very comfy seat, good padding 
-the canopy is twice as long as my Evenflo so it can cover baby almost completely
- the canopy stays in place; it doesn't fall forward or backward behind the seat
- the tightening mechanism under the baby's feet is easy to reach and VERY easy to adjust to make the straps tighter or looser depending on what baby is wearing
- the harness mechanism is very easy to adjust (the shoulder strap height). My Evenflo had to be rethreaded every few months and even my mechanically inclined husband said it was horrible.  The Flexloc is just a dial on the back that you turn--it's a breeze.
- The seat can be transfered between cars without the base.  It can be strapped directly to the car by using a seat belt on the car seat or by using the LATCH system if your car has it.
- the triangular handle has a nice grip and is easy to hold in any position
- this carseat is lighter than my Evenflo
- The cloth is very wipeable, not as absorbant of spills and stains as my Evenflo


Cons:
I found a few minor cons that definitely would not deter me from buying this carseat, and one that might (depending on how I can resolve it once I contact Babytrend).
- The release button to take the seat off its base is at the toes under the seat.  It's a little harder to reach than the ones behind the head if the carseat is backward facing.
- As others have said, the buttons to move the handle are a bit stiff, but not horribly so.  I was prepared for them to be way worse.
- The handle is thinner and doesn't FEEL as sturdy as my Evenflo when carrying baby around, but it hasn't had any problems
-This is the one BIG one that I have to check with Babytrend on:  Twice when I have turned a corner sharply, the carseat has tipped to a 45 degree angle!  I have tightened down the seatbelt as much as I could, putting my full weight on it and using the seatbelt retracting mechanism.  But maybe I'm still not doing it right.  The base is narrower than my Evenflo's was, so maybe that's why?  So I need to contact Babytrend and see if they have any suggestions.  Until then, I guess I'll take the corners slower!

Overall, I have felt like this seat was a MAJOR improvement over my Evenflo and even over the Graco Snugrides I checked out at the store.  It was intelligently designed to be easy to use and adjust as baby grows. I would recommend it for sure.  Just make sure you strap it in tightly or use the LATCH system if you have it"

Larsen,"Blacksburg, VA","I don't generally write reviews but wanted to praise Baby Trend on the design of this car seat.  We were directed to it after the January 07 Consumer Reports review showing this as one of only two infant car seats to pass their more stringent crash tests (TV news showed alarming video of various car seats flying around the passenger compartment after being struck by a vehicle).

Compared to our still-new Safety 1st seat, this one is so much better engineered in a number of ways:

1) The base is super easy to install.  Click twice into each of the car's two anchor points, then tug on each of the two straps to tighten the base.  That's it.  Our old seat had paragraphs of confusing directions that didn't leave me as confident as this one.
    
2) The base has an easily adjustable tilting mechanism and leveling indicator to insure you get the right angle for the baby's head (no flopping).  Our old seat had no such system - we used rolled-up towels.
    
3) The seat has a dial to quickly adjust the seat height as the baby grows.  No such system on our old seat.
    
4) The handle has an ergonomic triangle shape on top for more secure grasp when reaching into the car from the left or right.
    
5) If the base is not available, the seat can be strapped directly into a car using the car's lap belt.
    
6) The seat is overall more narrow than our old seat, allowing our two other kids to fit in the back seat with a little more breathing room.  Every inch helps.
    
7) The seat is lighter than our old seat, although it feels just as secure  and solid as the old one.
    
All this, and the seat is the same price as our old one.  Unfortunately Amazon/Target was sold out when the Consumer Reports issue came out, but I found them in stock online at Wally World, if you are looking to get one quickly.  The one for sale here is a better color combo than Wally's, unless you like lime green - but the seats themselves are all the same superb design.

Summary: super easy to install and adjust, well thought-out features, fair price!  Makes me want to have more kids just to buy more of these :"

Since my son was 3 months old we've turned it on every night at bedtime for him. He just watches the fishies swim around while the lights dance and the music plays. My son is now 7 months old and he still seems to like it.  And the cool thing is that now he is old enough to be able to interact with it.  If I switch it to manual MODE, he can turn on the music himself!  He can also play with the crackling feet and feel the silky material. Plus, he has another friend to keep him company in his crib (a big happy turtle with fish in his belly :-). Thus far, the straps haven't broken or cracked and I have removed it from the crib a couple of times. Also, the fish do swim around and the music does last for 15 minutes.  Its just a matter of which MODE you switch it to. (Reading the instructions really helps.) I strongly recommend this"

So, in the middle of the night when he wakes up, I turn it on and he's asleep by the time it runs out.  We have moved it twice and the straps seemed sturdy.  However, it is recommended that this toy be removed when the child is 5 months old or is able to get on hands and knees. This completely contradicts the interactive play mode, since the baby needs to be both physically and mentally developed to a stage beyond 5 months to reach all the buttons."

We actually came across them when Walmart stopped carrying the Parent's Choice Anti Colic bottles we had been using which are similar in design.

These bottles really seem to decrease the amount of air my daughter takes in while she's feeding.  This is a blessing as she has had problems with gas since birth.  She also has reflux.  I can't tell you if the bottles are a major factor in her improvement in that area because she is now on meds.  However, I have to think they've helped a bit.  They are also comfy to hold for me.

I've read a lot of reviews that talk about leaking.  I had this problem once and that was because I heated the bottle with the valve system in it.  So, I learned to not do so and have not had a problem since.

They are a bit pricy, but I believe that you get what you pay for.  

Lastly, I don't think that the small parts are difficult to wash.  Yes, it's a bit more time consuming if you don't have a dish washer, but for us, it's been well worth the extra time"

I never have problems with the bottle floating.  If you put the bottle in first and then fill the warmer with water like the directions tell you to, then the bottle won't float.  The warmer itself has a chart on it that tells you how long to leave the bottle in the warmer and at what setting.  It also has a light that flashes on and off when the warmer has reached a constant temperature.  There are no ""dings"" or timers, but that hasn't presented any problems for me.  Overall this product does what it is supposed to do and it does it well.  As a first time mom, I highly recommend it. "

Hansen,,"I thought a fold-up tub was a great idea, but we've used this only maybe 10 times before my daughter turned 6 months, the maximum age of use.  I paid only $10, so not much loss.  She objected the first time we tried it, at about 2 weeks, and so we went back to sponge baths for a while.  I would suggest gradually introducing your baby to the tub.  Toys helped distract her when she was a little older.  My daughter seemed too big for it even at 3 months, though she was always 97%+ in height & weight.  To wash her backside, you of course have to take her out of the tub.  I usually forgot to plug it before filling it, and so usually had water all over the floor.  Instructions say tub is supposed to be supported by a sink; it certainly doesn't fit in our oval bath sink.  Maybe it would fit a 2-part kitchen sink.  The folding feature did make it easy to store on our closet shelf.  For a little tub bath, I liked it.  It was good for a quick bath or to really soak her, but in the end I prefered a unhurried sponge bath on a waterproof pad on the bed, which I think got my daughter cleaner"

After working in daycare and as a nanny, I had a preference for these.  Then after my sister had my nephew and used them I knew the minute I found out I was expecting that I would be using them too.  

The reason that I love these bottles so much is that they are very easy for baby to latch onto.  Most other bottles use very small nipples whereas these use a nipple that is quite large, more like a breast.  If you think about how a woman's body is made and really look at the nipples you will see what I mean.  Being able to latch on better allows them to eat better and have much less gas and spit up.

I also love how easy they are to warm up in a bottle warmer or crock pot.  Because they use the liner, the milk can heat up much quicker than a standard bottle with thick plastic - a very important thought at 3AM!!!

Some people think having to always by liners is costly an annoying.  But not really.  100 eight ounce liners will cost about $8 and will last about 2 to 2 1/2 weeks.  So not as bad as you might think.  (If this is truly an issue for you, consider the Advent bottles.  They also have relatively large nipples.  But because they do not use a liner, you cannot eliminate the air from the bottle and they take much longer to warm up.) "

I had intended to only breastfeed for the first year, but it turned out that my daughter had a very difficult time at first with latching on. So much so that she ended up taking in very little milk and her weight dropped nearly a whole pound from her birth weight in the first week. The pediatrician told us we would have to supplement with formula to bring her weight up. I chose the Premium Nurser bottles because they said they were good for switching between breast and bottle feeding. My daughter took well to the bottles, and even started latching on better when I did breast feed. I'm continuing to use formula along with breastfeeding with no nipple confusion problems whatsoever. When people ask me if I breastfeed or bottlefeed my baby, I say ""both"", and they tell me how lucky I am! These bottles are a life-saver! They're easy to clean (I use the top rack of the dishwasher), and my baby hasn't had any problems with colic. I like the convenience of the disposable bags, too.

The seat and the base are both easy to install and the seat is easy to adjust and to carry.  As the product name suggests, my son fits snugly and comfortably into the seat.

The only problem that I have is with the process for adjusting the harness.  The buckles to do so are at the back of the seat and do not allow the harness straps to move easily.  I have found that I have to get behind the seat and really work at the straps and the buckles to adjust the seat properly, which is difficult to do if the seat and baby are already in the car.  Apart from that, the seat provides good value for the price"

Barba ""lbarba""",,"I got this toy when my baby was 7 months old, and he's now 8 1/2 months old.  We've used it for lots of local driving and a roundtrip from Los Angeles to Phoenix (7+ hours each way).  It doesn't work miracles, but it does definitely help calm and distract my baby when he starts to fuss, about 70%-80% of the time.  And I think it's more effective now than it was when we first got it, maybe because the baby has started to look forward to it. It might help that I *only* use it when he starts to fuss. 

I haven't had any problems with the toy working, and the volume dial is a nice feature. It does have its shortcomings, though, like some of the other reviewers pointed out: It only stays on for about 15 minutes (presumably to save batteries) so pretty much every time I put the baby in his carseat, I push the button to turn it on, just in case we need it during the drive.  It sometimes moves out of place which can affect being able to see the baby in the mirror, but it still works to distract him.  It plays 5 or 6 songs in random order, but they are all extremely short, so it ends up being very repetitive.  

Overall, I think it's a useful tool for calming the baby during car trips, and when it doesn't work it's generally because my baby is so tired or hungry that I don't think anything would really help except getting him out of the car.  And even though the repetitive songs can get annoying, it's far better than hearing a baby screaming while everyone is trapped in the car together"

Bucci,"Houston, TX USA","Due to the room layout, I needed a double bed rail that would protect both sides of the bed.  We don't live near a store that has a lot of choices and after reading many online product descriptions decided that we were going to need to look at several of these ""in person"" and then decide which one best fit our needs.  So we purchased 4 brands of bed rails.

After looking at the more detailed information on the box and trying two of them out, we decided to keep the Safe and Secure Double Bedrail by the First Years.

To help others, I have attached two customer's photos to this product description.  These photos are sketches and photos from the side of the box that better describe the bed rail.  Why amazon/Target can't get a least as much information on their website than is on the side of the box is frustrating to me.  But that seems to happen many times.  

This bedrail took about 30 minutes to assemble the side panels and another 45 minutes to fully assemble the unit to the bed.  This is in line with the time that the other model we tried out took.  

The reasons why we liked this bed rail the best are as follows:
(1)	It is a double bed rail and is designed to protect both sides of the bed.
(2)	This was the only model we looked at where both sides folded down making mattress pad and sheet changes feasible.  
(3)	The quality of the construction (especially of the spring loaded Locking Pins) was much better than that of the Sleeptite bed rail we looked at from Regalo and One Step Ahead (which is also made by Regalo.)
(4)	The design made more sense than the Regalo.   The installation was more straightforward.  

Possible issues with this bed rail are as follows:
(1)	It is only 17"" high, so measure your mattress and make sure that it will fit.  In our case, our mattress was not a pillowtop and is about 10-11"" high, depending on where you measure it.  So we were still satisfied with the height of the rail above our mattress.   But I could see where if you had a tall mattress this would be an issue.
(2)	This was the easiest rail to pull up to unlock and fold down.   Others had more substantial locking mechanisms.   I could see where a toddler who watched you do this, could then do it himself.  So we are planning on not doing this in front of our toddler, only during sheet changes.   Only you know how inquisitive your own child is about these things and how much of a problem this would be.  

Despite these two issues, we decided that the good points outweighed the bad and that this bedrail was the best choice for us.  However, if we are later disappointed with this bed rail, I will go and update our review.   "

The shades come with two straps, one small and one large.  My daughter is four months old and the smaller strap barely fits but the larger one is still a little big.  The velcro on either side of the smaller strap is just barely attached and fits comfortably only if around the bottom of her head.  In this position, her ears are a little pushed down but as the strap is soft it's not a big deal.  If straight around her head, the shades are too tight and squish the area around her eyes.  Even if adjusted as small as possible, the large strap is still a little too big.  It should fit in another month I think. "

The only reason I gave it four stars is because it only has two channels and because the signals aren't encrypted.  Anyone else with an FM receiver can pick up your conversations, but most monitors are this way.   We took the monitor to a friend's house and it picked up a lot of static/interference from something in the house (Video monitor, TV, I don't know.)  Since it only had two channels, we were not able to find a clear channel. 

Overall thoughts: Best monitor I've had (Stay away from the Fisherprice models).  I would buy again unless I was in an apartment complex (I wouldn't want other people listening in), and I would be prepared to take it back if I needed more channels"

I have 5 month old twins that were born 6 weeks early. I swaddled them in receiving blankets when they came home from the NICU and they loved sleeping that way. I stopped swaddling them at 2 months because I could see they no longer liked it. My night nurse told me to continue to swaddle them at night for up to a year. She said it would help them sleep through the night. I bought this product and while my girl and boy twins didn't like it at first they do go to sleep faster and stay asleep longer when they are wearing them. Not long after I started using this product my son slept from 7 to 7. What a dream! He is getting better at getting at least one arm out but even when he does he still sleeps better then when he is not swaddled at all. I have found that it works better when I put them in it when they are drowsy because then they don't lay in their crib trying to get out of it before they fall asleep. We don't use them during the day now. I will always give this as a baby gift going forward

Fischer ""seasoned traveler""",,"As very frequent (often long-distance) travelers, we routinely purchase airline tickets for our daughter so that she can travel safely and comfortably in her car seat on plane trips.  We really pushed the size limits of the car seat that integrated into a stroller (the Graco travel system) for ease of use, but once she had finally made the dreaded transition into a larger seat, we tried practically every method for moving the seat, toddler, diaper bag, collapsible stroller, carry-on, etc., from our home to and through the airport without ending up completely exhausted and frustrated.    Of all of the options that we tried, the Pac Back was the most consistently comfortable and convenient.  I'm not very tall (5'5""), and find that I can manage to wear the Pac Back, stow loose and light objects (such as coats or stuffed animals) in the car seat itself, sling a diaper bag over one shoulder and a purse on the other, and still have enough mobility/agility to bend down and pick my daughter up or hold her hand.  (Granted, I look like a Pac Animal, but that's a small price to pay for having free hands at key moments.)  The  strap system is intuitive to use and seems well-constructed.  Compared to a car seat bag, the Pac Back is much more easily removed from the car seat once on the plane, and I have never had any trouble replacing the straps in a minute or two -- plenty of time to have the seat on my back by the time people start exiting the plane.  The straps adjust easily enough that my taller husband and I can take turns carrying the seat when we travel together without spending a lot of time situating ourselves.  The only drawbacks: you really have to pay attention while wearing what amounts to a giant rigid backpack that you don't bash someone or something while turning, and the straps may have to be removed to go through security IF the x-ray machine has an extremely small opening (only happened once or twice at regional airports).  Overall, an amazingly simple but incredibly helpful product."

I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep, then put her in her crib... and she'd flail her arms, wake up and cry, and I had to start all over! What a nightmare! 

Then I figured out that since her arms wake her, it would make sense to wrap her in something so she couldn't move them as much... so I started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets. It worked! It became much easier to get her to sleep. But then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again. 

When she was a little over a month old, somehow I came across SwaddleMe blankets on the Internet and immediately bought it. It worked great! It was so easy to wrap my daughter in it, and it stayed put. My daughter started sleeping so much better! 

I wish I found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me from so many sleepless nights! 

2 years later, my son was born, and thankfully I already knew about those blankets from the start. He goes to sleep great in the SwaddleMe blanket! Out of curiosity, I tried to put him to sleep without this blanket, and his arms wake him right away - exactly the same as my daughter!

It was a life saver.  At around 4-6 weeks, my baby would only sleep if held or laying on his side next to me after breastfeeding.  Since it's impossible to hold a baby all night and laying next to me on his side was a ""No, No"" for SIDS, I was looking for something that could help me get him to sleep in his bassinet on his back as is suggested to prevent SIDS.  I had tried swaddling my baby in blankets, but after a few weeks he had figured out how to get out of it.  I also didn't like that he could undo the blanket and it was loose around his face, another ""no, no"" for SIDS. So I bought these swaddle Me blankets that fasten easily with velcro.  And shortly after we started using the Swaddle me's, he started sleeping through the night, occasionally waking up for a 15 minute feeding (which I keep him swaddled for) and then he falls right back to sleep and I carefully pick him up and put him back in the bassinett for the rest of the night.  He's 4 months old now and we're still using them.... Buy a few, because if we wets himself, which boys do a lot, you'll need another one to switch him into"

She loves to be swaddled but is very strong and would wiggle out and then wake up and need to be swaddled again.  With the velcro she is less able to get out of the swaddle and feels safe and secure and sleeps longer.

The fleece has a little more stretch to it and is easier to use but the flannel is a little lighter weight for the summer so not to overheat.  Have not tried the cotton ones.

Definitely worth a try"

My baby had reflux really bad when she was born and alot of the times, the only way to help her feel comfortable was to have her in the Bjorn facing me so that she could fall asleep.  (She needed to be upright or inclined to help her not to spit up so much)  Being that it was so used, Im super glad that its easy to put on and take off.  The durability of it is awesome also and I still dont see any wear and tear on it after almost daily use. 

Now that my baby is getting older, I switch her forward and she loves that.  She can see everything and grab at whatever is in front of her.  The ease of the clips is a godsend, so that I can clip her in quickly and without the need for someone to assist me.

I tried some other carriers, but all the straps and clips were so confusing.  Plus alot of the others arent reversible.  You can only have your baby face inwards.

The first one I bought many years ago when the superyard was made with protruding metal hinges which were somewhat hazardous and invited mouthing by little teethers. Aside from being a little stiff to fold (which might be because it is new) this model is a vast improvment over the old. It's a couple of inches taller and seems sturdier. Great for blocking off the Christmas tree or any other part of the house. Cruising babies love to go round and round the inside and you can hang a busy box or other toys on the side to amuse a crawling baby. 
During football season, my friends and I take our superyards to tailgate and join them together to make a super superyard, so all the toddlers can safely play together. It's easy to clean using the pressure nozzle on the hose outdoors. Minor drawback is that it can be scooted across the floor or climbed out of by a determined toddler. Do I really need to say that any play yard should always be used only under adult supervision? Final comment - one of the most useful pieces of child-care equipment I've

It is just a tiny bit awkward to reach for the latch to release and pull back the gate but this is a very minor issue.  In a similar vien, you have to line up the bottom rail at the same time you line up the top rail in order to close.

There was not a better rated stroller available when I researched, and there still is not. You can run, walk or rollerblade behind this stroller and feel confident that your child is safe. Lilyana is now 4 1/2 months and loves going for our daily walks, and occasional rollerblading.
She is a fussy girl, (only) when it comes to being strapped down in the carseat, but loves the comfort and hammock like feel of BOB. 
We live in Florida, and with the sun-guard canopy, she is well covered.
Some other factors which made we chose BOB:
* The braking mechanism, which is hard to find, has a wrist strap which if you should fall, locks the back wheels (unlike most strollers on the market). This feature is great for rollerbladers.
* 5 point safety harness
* 70 pound weight limit (highest that I found)
* Metal frame (others have more plastic that metal)
* Shock absorbers, great of rocking/bouncing her to sleep
* Swivel front wheel, which locks with a simple pin.
* Simple Lily likes it, and we tried several others, all that Babies-R-Us has in stock.

The cost is pretty high, but would you put a price on the safety of your child, if you were to fall while exercising?

The mat also has entertainment value, as she can name the items on it.  After she's made her mess, we just peel the mat off, wad it up, and throw it away"

It really does eliminate the need for coats or even jackets. The first time I used it I thought my daughter might get a little chilly on the top half so I put a jacket on her. As soon as I was indoors and took her out of the bundleme I saw that she was too warm. She was actually sweating. Ever since then I use it without anything else and she stays very warm and cozy. We have lots of snow and cold winters where I live and the bundleme original was perfect. No more fussing with a blanket that gets kicked off the moment your baby is in the back seat of the car. The top piece also has the option to zip all the way off so if it's the only part that needs washed you don't have to take the straps out of the bottom piece. You can also unzip both sides to keep from over heating your baby if you'll be indoors for a short period of time. I think that every mom should have one and I would definitely buy one again

When #3 came along we needed to purchase a new Pack-n-Play.  The Graco Pack N Play with bug toys is absolutely the best we've ever owned.  The bright colors and cute toys make it a fun environment for our 8 month old.  She has loved the bright play mat since about 6 months, but now that she is sitting up she enjoys looking in the mirror and pulling on the rattle butterfly wings.  She actually gets excited about playing in her Pack N Play... and mom can get dinner cooked without interruption!

And, best of all, it is so much bigger than the other Pack N Plays.  There is plenty of room for her to play without rolling over the top of her toys.  The set up and take down is super easy... all four sides break-down very easily and it folds nicely without any hassle.  I am also a fan of the much thicker play mat that fits into the floor of the Pack N Play.  I never worried about her hurting herself if she plopped over when first learning to sit up.

Overall, I can't say enough WONDERFUL things about this product!  I'd put it on the new parent's ""must have"" list for sure"

We were in the market for a new stroller because one of the wheels on our old double stroller had broken off twice and was about to break off again.  I was looking for a stroller that wouldn't make my older daughter feel like ""a baby,"" but gave her the option of sitting during long trips to the mall, zoo, park, etc.  This stroller was the answer!
The front seat is perfect for our little one.  The tray swings open (and comes completely off, if needed) to get her in and out easily.  I was able to unhook some of the belts and stuff them behind the cushion of her seat because I didn't think a 5-point harness was necessary.  The tray is large and sturdy, as is the foot rest.
My older daughter is technically taller than the guidelines, but we have absolutely no problem because of it.  She walks with us and then easily climbs onto her seat when she wants to take a break.
The parent tray is great and something I really missed on our last double stroller.  We can store keys, snacks, cellphone, etc., plus two cups/bottles.  The basket underneath is a good size and very easy to access.  The side of the basket is elastic and pulls down nicely and even unsnaps if need be.
The stroller folds and unfolds extremely easily.  It takes very little room to store.  The steering is fantastic and it requires very little effort to push.
The stroller also comes with a contraption to fit an infant carrier for families with a newborn/infant.
The price is fantastic too.  You can't beat $120 for a double stroller like this!
I wish we had bought this a year ago"

Those of you who say it takes time to snap it on and off aren't thinking about what you have to do to change the crib sheet.

Then you have to lift up the mattress to get to the sheet bottom and pull it over the corners.  Did I mention that moving the mattress causes that cute little dust ruffle to get out of poistion?

Personally I think these are some of the best tub toys!  My suggestion is to just buy the crayons and forget the pallet.  You can also use them in the pool and if you have a vinyl siding house and your children have sprinkler, it also makes a great place to color.  Be careful to wash everything off before it dries."

Yes, the volume is low, but there's a very simple solution to that -- put it near your head.

A couple of reviewers said their machines stopped working and would only play for 5 seconds. If this happens to you, turn it over and flip the switch off of DEMO mode -- it has the 5-second setting so you can try it out in the store.

Completely assembled except for sliding the four leg castors into place and lifting the bars to an open position. Click- Done! Has two adjustable height settings, and comes with a nice mattress. I would not order another one. This is very soft and suitable. This rolls easily and the pack and play bedding fits it perfectly. The Eddie Bauer sheets from Target come in a fleece fabric that is extremely soft, love it! My crib skirt from a large crib fits with adjustments and I love the way it turned out. In fact I can't believe this is one of the cheapest alternatives, since I would say it is nicer than the wooden mini-cribs I saw in person at a local store. 

I have a 24 month old and I did not want two cribs, but I also did not want to rush her into a toddler bed. We bought one, but she doesn't want to stay in it at night. She feels safe and sleeps well in her crib.

I've had it for about two and a half months now. At first it helped me stay on my side, and was just comfy to snuggle up to. Now that my belly is getting bigger, it gives great support and doesn't let my belly ""hang"" down. This is great for people who don't always sleep on their sides as once you position it you are unlikely to roll over in your sleep. I've had no problem with the stuffing. If you are looking for super firm support, try a wedge. This is a pillow, and feels as such. Of course, if you are on a budget, you can always just use a regular pillow, but if you want to pamper yourself the unique shape of this pillow makes it extra comfortable.

**UPDATE** I'm now 8 months pregnant and love my pillow! Mine came covered in a zippered cover, so that is what I wash.  Every few nights, I just grab the larger part and shake it HARD until the stuffing falls down, then fluff it and it is as good as new.

This pillow makes it easy to keep next to you and to turn over.  I would just like it to be longer so I can have the little end between my legs, and the rest up higher so I can cuddle with it.  When between my legs (which helps) the rest of the pillow only is around my stomach and I wish it came up to my breast area so my arms could cuddle around it a little easier.

This simply constructed unit has no corners or edges.  It has smooth contours including the splash guard that does not come off and is attached to the catch basin.  The catch basin is a combination seat/emptying pail which enables you to easily remove and empty.  It is easily cleaned and because of the simple design less appealing to play with.  

I think the best feature is the smooth built in splash guard which you need with boys.  

This seat does not convert to a toilet seat for the bathroom toilet, which I think doesn't work anyway - on the other potty chairs I purchased the seats slide and flop when you put it on the real toilet and then becomes unsafe.  I recommend the Babybjorn toilet trainer for that"

With regard to previous comments about not sterlising equipment, I should point out that there is a difference between clean and sterile. All babies are vulnerable to the germs that cause diarrhoea and vomiting, and so it is best to continue sterilising bottles and teats (and breast pump equipment) until your baby is one year old and has built up more resistance to bacteria generally. Cleaning your baby's bottles and teats in a dishwasher will not always heat them to the right temperature to kill off all known bugs, so it's generally still advisable to sterilise after washing. If you do want to rely on your dishwasher alone, it needs to be run on a hot programme at a minimum temperature of 80 degrees centigrade. The bottles then need be filled with feed straight away as the dishwasher will not leave them in a completely sterile condition. 

It may seem pointless to sterilise feeding equipment when your baby is crawling around the floor and putting all sorts of things in his mouth, but the bugs that stick to milk curds can be dangerous. Your baby's immune system will grow stronger into the second year and he'll be able to combat infections more easily. 

It might seem inconvenient to some, but sterilising reduces your baby's chances of ingesting harmful bacteria and it's about the baby's health, not what the mother's feels she doesnt have time for. "

We've been using it for a few weeks now and it's gone off twice - scaring us, but making us glad that we have it.  Both times that its gone off, our daughter has been very tightly swaddled, so we think that made her breathing shallow and thus set off the alarm.  You can change the sensitivity on it, but the default setting should be fine.  

There is a bit of background noise or static that you can hear.  My husband solved that issue by placing a piece of regular household tape on the bottom few speaker holes.  It is still loud enough for us to hear her without the extra noise.  

It does take some getting used to - you have to turn off the sensor and put it in sound only mode whenever you remove the baby from the crib, otherwise the sensor will go off.  But this `inconvenience' is totally worth the peace of mind this sensor gives you.  

I believe they sell this with only one parent unit - but you really want to get two.  Leave one in the bedroom and keep the other mobile - we constantly move the second from the kitchen to the bonus room, to the living room, etc.  

This sensor is an amazing product and worth every penny."

Highly recommended to all parents!,"December 9, 2006",A. Harris,"Orange County, CA","We love the Diaper Dekor and have referred it to many of our friends and family!  It is SUPER simple to use and the refills which seem expensive at first are actually cheaper than other brands because they last for 2-3 months vs. a week (i.e. Diaper Genie)!

From reading the other reviews, I think I can clear a few things up - it seems these people have been misled hence their problems with this product.  First, there are 2 versions of this pail - a larger called DIAPER DEKOR PLUS and regular size called simply DIAPER DEKOR. Thus, there are 2 different sizes of refills, PLUS and REGULAR.  You can find out which model you have by simply opening the door on the pail - there is a sticker that will have the model on there - if you do not see PLUS anywhere, you will need to buy REGULAR refills - the PLUS will not fit, and vice versa.

Secondly, the refills are VERY easy to insert, you simply follow the directions which come with the unit.  Basically, you remove the plastic insert, wrap the opened refills from the inside of the insert and around the top - the excess refill wraps around the outside of the plastic and then you sit it in the pail - knot tied in the bottom of the new refill.  If you have a unit, this will make sense - if you haven't bought one yet, I probably just confused you - but you will see once you get it that it is very easy to do!

Last but not least, the refills that have been on the market for the past year have absolutely no scent at all - I personally would not mind having a baby powder scent but these have no scent.  It's not like I will be sniffing inside the pail or anything, so it doesn't matter - afterall, once the refill is in the pail, NO SCENT will come out - not even dirty diapers!

Unfortunately, it seems these few reviewers who gave this product a poor rating were misinformed by store workers and their poor review actually had nothing to do with the product but rather frustration stemming from unknowledgable employees at baby stores.  I hope this has helped!  We've had this unit for nearly a year and absolutely swear by it!  It is a GODSEND!  No smells and how much easier can you get than just dropping a diaper into the pail and not having to do another thing!  Not many other units will allow you to store up to 3 weeks of diapers without a single scent"

I only give it 4 stars because I really could not snap the seat to the toilet and because the whole construction is so darn plasticky. Ah, and the music never worked (no loss in my opinion, I was there to do the encouraging) and the training book seemed a bit cheesy.

The firm bottom piece seems to work well to prevent any more indentations from showing up. And both of the carseats are as secure as ever. I have the rear and forward facing models.

As the mom of a boy, I don't use the plastic guard because it sticks up too much over the seat, but even for boys this seat is mess free.

But I'd like to stress as other people have done that you have to practice with it to find what works for you.  It may be too big for your newborn.  I started using it when my son was 4 weeks, but he was a large baby.  

I've found the key is wear it high!  The instructions say the you and your baby will be more comfortable with baby at chest height.  It's true!  If you try to wear it with the baby hanging a little lower near your stomach it's going to hurt your back and shoulder and wear you out and he/she's going to squirm and be uncomfortable.  

I used it every day of my sons 3rd month when we were in hotels between moving.  Now I used it every time I grocery shop because as soon as he's in it he falls asleep, no matter the time of day.  If I try to push him through the whole store sitting in the cart in his carseat he'll start screaming but if I put him in my sling I won't hear a peep out of him the whole trip.

And you have to admit it's so cute and stylish!  Several people have stopped to ask me where I got it and I love directing them to Amazon! "

No matter how fretful his mewling, when we swaddled him and placed him in this sling, he would fall asleep. Because he otherwise rarely slept in those early weeks, he spent a good deal of time in it.  Three aspects of the design are great: 1. The bottom is padded so you can lay baby on a hard surface and use sling as a changing pad; 2. The sides are high and have drawstrings that allow the sling to be opened up almost flat; 3. It grows with your baby--my tiny baby hated the front-type Bjorn carriers, but loved this and still likes it.  One aspect of the design is, to me, dreadful--the shoulder strap! It should be wider and padded.  I tried repositioning it every which way and no matter what I did, the strap dug into my shoulder.  In the end I just put a thick mitten under the strap on my shoulder.  Good use for a mitten that's lost it's mate, but I would rather have a better strap"

Because it is side-by-side, it can be a tight fit going through some doors, but I have never been unable to get through a door.  

My husband thinks that some of the parts are cheap and look like they can break easily, but with 6 months of lots of use, we have had no problems.

Weaver ""New Mommy""","Beaumont,  CA","This Graco Family Tree Play Yard is perfect for newborns. The setup isn't quite as easy as the description implies, simply because the instructions are all pictures, without corresponding written directions. That said, a little patience the first time around makes setting up and putting away the play yard incredibly easy afterward.

The quilted mattress pad serves double duty to wrap around the folded up play yard when you need to take it on the go. I find this especially convenient because it guarantees that I won't leave an essential piece at home when I take the yard with me.

The description is a bit in error in regards to the mobile and the music. An attachment that sits on the side of the yard has an incredible variety of settings for vibration, music/noise, and lighting. There are different timed settings you can use to help get baby to sleep. The music is NOT, however, directly attached to the mobile. Also, the mobile sits on its own; it does not turn. That bothered me at first, but I quickly got over it when I realized my newborn didn't seem to care anyway.

The changing table sits higher than those on other play yards that I've seen, making diaper changes much easier on the back. The built in diaper holder and baby wipes holder are convenient for those rush changes. The changing table is padded and easy to clean up, though you need to use lap pads or something of that sort, as there isn't a removable pad on it. This is actually to my preference, as it's less stuff for my baby to have to contend with, but may be bothersome to parents who think their baby needs the extra cushioning.

When taking this on the go, as I said, it's easy to pack up. One minor drawback is the travel bag that holds the play yard. It doesn't have a handle, and it doesn't fit all the components of the yard. The changing table and the mobile sit at home when I take this on the go. The reality is, if I'm travelling, it's more convenient to not have these extra pieces to worry about. However, I'm not sure how I'll pack them up when my baby outgrows the changing table and is just using the yard itself. I consider that a very minor consideration though.

This play yard sits in my living room where it is incredibly convenient because it has space to hold all of my baby essentials so that I'm not having to constantly run to the nursery. I'm not sure what the parent organizers are intended to be for (they look like little soft-sided cup holders), but I've found them to be convenient places to store extra burp cloths, a pacifier, and socks that are just too little to stay together anywhere else."

She quickly became too tall to use the stand alone potty seat, so I ordered this Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer and it has been fantastic. She quickly learned how to put the seat on the toilet herself and adjust the wheel to make it snug. It was also easy for her to remove and hang on a small butterfly doorknob my husband attached to the side of the sink cabinet. The seat gave her a great sense of independence and allowed her to be comfortable and secure while learning to use the big potty. 

It is also great for traveling. I would put it in a zippered canvas tote and carry it with us into rest areas (it really does fit any toilet) - she could sit securely and be protected from unclean surfaces (I would carry a small container of Disinfectant wipes to clean her seat off each time we used it in a public restroom). 

I highly recommend this Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer"

He loved bath time until just a few weeks ago, when he outgrew our original Especially for Baby (the BRU ""house"" brand) tub seat. In desperation, we searched the shelves at BRU and settled on the Mother's Touch.

I can't say enough good things about this tub seat. The head support features a soft washcloth-like insert to cushion a newborn's delicate head, and it can be repositioned or removed as the baby grows. The two-position back reclines for newborns, and sits up straighter for older babies. The entire seat is up high enough that quite a bit of water is needed in the tub, but I found that it makes it easier to control how deep my baby sits in the water (in the old tub seat, he had to be up to his ears in order to have enough water to bathe in). One of the things my son hated about his previous tub seat was that he couldn't sit up in it. The design of the Mother's Touch provides enough support to allow Baby to sit up mostly unassisted, and the ample padding makes sure he doesn't bruise himself on the hard edges. Even though there's lots of support and padding, it's still very important to closely supervise your baby when using this (or any) tub seat. 

Another reviewer mentioned a couple of things things that I'd like to respond to: 
*There are no suction cups on the base: I have found that the rubber grips provide more than enough traction, but tubs may vary. 
*She would like a strap: the seat that I have does have a strap (it's stored underneath the seat, so may not be immediately identifiable), so I wonder if the seat has been redesigned recently.

Overall, my son and I are very happy with this tub seat, and I've been recommending it to friends. They'll have to buy it new instead of getting it as a hand-me-down, though. I foresee him being able to use it for most of his first year before he outgrows it!"

The other thing that I like about it is that you can wrap the wings around the baby's waist or upper chest, leave his arms out, and use it during the day like a blanket.  Voila, a blanket that won't fall off when you're holding him, or be kicked off when he's lying down.  Kiddopotamus has really come up with some great products.  You might also want to check out the Piddle Pad.  Another great invention/product by Kiddopotamus"

I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep, then put her in her crib... and she'd flail her arms, wake up and cry, and I had to start all over! What a nightmare! 

Then I figured out that since her arms wake her, it would make sense to wrap her in something so she couldn't move them as much... so I started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets. It worked! It became much easier to get her to sleep. But then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again. 

When she was a little over a month old, somehow I came across SwaddleMe blankets on the Internet and immediately bought it. It worked like a charm! It was so easy to wrap my daughter in it, and it stayed put. My daughter started sleeping so much better! 

I wish I found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me from so many sleepless nights! 

2 years later, my son was born, and thankfully I already knew about those blankets from the start. He goes to sleep great in the SwaddleMe blanket! Out of curiosity, I tried to put him to sleep without this blanket, and his arms wake him right away - exactly the same as my daughter! 

I consider this blanket one of the most important baby items you could buy. It should be a must for a new mother who wants to get some sleep"

Clark ""DC Sambista""","Washington, DC","I and my wife have been very pleased with the Jeep Wrangler All-Weather umbrella stroller.  Unlike the cheap umbrella stroller we used to have, this one has better construction for the main folding support tubes. Plus, the handles are longer which means I (5'-1'' guy) don't have to walk like a neanderthal to push my toddler. The wheels do work pretty well on most surfaces even in very light snow.  The brakes are durable plastic and should last longer than my previous stroller. The pouches are an added plus for storing snacks or bus passes. 

My only disappointment has been the sun screen. It is not that useful for blocking the sun from my son's eyes unless I pull it directly in front of him. At that point, he can't see anything. That's OK if he falls asleep, but otherwise he (an independent todler) will pull the sunscreen off if it blocks his view.

An added bonus would be a shoulder strap that I could use to carry the stroller for walking more than a few feet. While it's light and compact for a stroller, it is still cumbersome to carry if you have to fold it on the bus or walk anywhere with it. Frequently my son wants to walk so I take the stroller with me because I know he'll get tired. So again, a shoulder strap would make toting the stroller much easier"

It's much easier to clean than other manual pumps (e.g. gerber) because there are few parts to remove so your chance of losing or breaking parts is much lower.  The pump has a strong suction, so I've had no problem expressing milk (e.g. up to 8 ounces or more each time).  I just had my 2nd child a month ago, and already I'm able to express 5+ ounces of milk at once.

From reading the other reviews I think that alot of other mothers expected results from this pump that just arent reasonable. Remember most manual pumps arent for constant expressing purposes or for bringing in milk supply. If you read tegh package the manufacturer even says that they recommend the pump for emptying breasts occasionally like when spending time away from baby or breastfeeding moms who express once or twice a day so others can feed baby. And they discourage it for working moms who have to pump everyday.

My son receives only breastmilk and this system has made it SO easy to express, store, and feed him with a bottle.

I have not found the liner cost to be a problem.  Nor was I disturbed by how many kits I needed to buy.  I think I bought 5 or 6 to make sure I had enough.  It just depends on how much you're going to need to store.  But you don't need many actual bottles, since the milk doesn't have to be stored in them, so the price evened out for me.  Besides, it's much cheaper than buying formula!

I also don't care about exact measurements of how much my son eats.  I can get the measurement just by lifting the liner out and taking a look.  But when he's at the breast, I don't know how much he's eaten, so I don't track just how much he has from the bottle, either.  I just make sure he has enough dirty diapers.

I find the system easy to use because I can express directly into a liner, put the bottle into the freezer, then remove the liner from the bottle when it's frozen.  This reduces the space needed.  When it's feeding time, just pop one of them into a bottle, heat, and replace the cap with a nipple.  Easy!  "

Before this, I was pumping and storing in Medela bottles, then transferring to Playtex liners before feeding. Then I had to wash all the Medela bottles, plus Playtex rings, etc. 
With this system, I just pump right into the liners. They are so easy to just grab out of the fridge and go. I can warm a bottle with the car warmer using the self-contained liners, instead of having to bring a medela bottle to warm, PLUS a playtex system.
Overall, this has saved me several steps and less things to wash. For the dad who said it threw off the ounce markers - that is true. However, the liners themselves have ounce markings on them. Just unscrew the top ring slightly so that the liner sinks back down and then read the ounce marker on the liner. Easy!
I would not buy this system to use for storing frozen milk (if you store a lot of it). It would get too expensive for my tastes. I have two sets and that is perfect for refrigerator storage. Make sure you get two, because each box only comes with one pump adapter.
Highly recommended by one happy mamma"

Jones ""beyond normal""","Salinas, CA USA","I'm a mother of a 21-month-old. I just got a puppy and was having a hard time managing the stroller AND the leash on our walks. This backpack is perfect. It fits me well and my daughter loves it. She asks to stay in it when we're done! I was worried about that because she never liked any of the baby carriers I've tried before when she was younger. You do have to toughen up your shoulders (by taking shorter walks at first) before going on any long hikes, of course. I don't understand the chest problem on one of the other reviews, because the chest strap is adjustable, long, and sits just below the shoulders, avoiding the ""busty"" area very well. However, it does come out of the box at the shortest setting, so you have to loosen it to fit your frame. The question of being able to ""close"" the frame with the child in it doesn't seem to be an issue on mine. The stand part folds up easily under the child once the child is on your back. You do need long enough arms to grab it behind you, though. It makes no difference to you or the child if you leave the frame in the open position during your walk, but if you're in tight quarters, you'll want to close it. I did make the mistake of trying to put Aeryn's (my daughter's) feet behind me in the frame at first, which made her knees rest uncomfortably on the frame. The legs are supposed to go naturally forward toward either side of your waist. (The picture on the box helped me figure that out.) It is for kids from 6 months up to 36 months, and comes with a clear rain shield that easily zips onto the retractable sun shield. The rain shield is also helpful in windy conditions- my daughter thinks it's cool and leans over to fog it with her breath. It's not easy to do with a six-month-old puppy jumping around on you, but I've even managed to get into the straps and stand up from the floor with Aeryn in the pack (I'm reasonably fit, and she's just under 30 pounds). This thing is rugged, comfortable, good-looking, and has ""be prepared"" features like a cellphone holder and a matching fanny pack (that can be carried on the frame, if you'd rather)"

"B0009F8RAQ:after_three_babies,_my_original_new_native_sling_is_finally_wearing_out...:leeann_balbirona",B0009F8RAQ,New Native Baby Carrier: Khaki Medium (chest size 34-37): Baby,baby,42 of 42,5.0,"After three babies, my original New Native sling is finally wearing out...","December 13, 2005",LeeAnn Balbirona,Washington state,"I received my original New Native sling as a baby shower gift back in 1997. I wore it nearly every day for 15 months and then again with babies #2 and #3. Now we are expecting our fourth baby and the fabric is a bit faded and worn (we have the purple one), so I thought it time to buy a second sling. The original is still good as far as the stitching goes and we'll still use it, but I'm a bit tired of the purple color after nine years! :) 

Pros: This sling is the smallest as far as packing it with you. It's a simple double band of fabric that can be folded up in your bag or purse easily. Men don't mind wearing it (at least my husband didn't), it comes in basic solid colors and doesn't scream ""baby!"" when you're out and about. Many people couldn't tell I was wearing the baby when she was little. It's a good place for the baby to nap and to cover you up a bit when you nurse, once you figure that out. It's more versatile than other types of baby carriers in that you can use it from newborn to toddler (I've even used it with two-year-olds for short periods when they are tired of walking and the stroller isn't an option). You can carry the baby on your front or back (with experience, this is doable, but mostly for older babies), on your hip (once your baby can sit strongly). It's also easy to throw in the wash when the baby's diaper inevitably leaks or spits up all over it. (No complicated latches, webbing or snaps to clean.)

Cons: If you get the wrong size, the baby will hang too low and your back will hurt. My original is the Large size (based on chest measurements from the manufacturer) but I'm going to order a Medium this time. My husband still likes the Large, but he has a longer torso than I. Newborns may need some support in the New Native sling, otherwise you may feel they are swimming in the fabric. I always use a tightly rolled-up receiving blanket and place it in the sling first, then lay the baby's head and back on top of it. This pushes the baby up enough toward the opening so that you don't feel like she's lost in there. Usually I only do this for the first few weeks. After a while, your baby will be big enough to peek out on her own and wave at people.

The trickiest thing with the New Native carrier is learning to sling the baby on your back, which enables you to do things like cooking and unloading the dryer while your baby sleeps. You have to put the baby in on your front first then shimmy the fabric around with the baby in it. If you can master this, the sling is ideal for the fussy baby or for all-day babywearing.

Highly recommended! Good value for your money."

Our dear daughter suffered with severe GERD and would cry for hours. As soon as I placed her in the sling she would immediately relax. It was like magic and truly kept me sane.
After doing some reading I found that this was not only great for colicky babies but was better for their spines than other types of carriers and so much easier to take with us. Our daughter loved to be held and this helped tremendously. When we go on trips I always take it with me as she is sure to tire of her stroller. She loves hanging out in the sling and it is very versatile. I recently tried one of those baby carriers that are like a backpack thing to take with us on a trip since our dear daughter has somewhat outgrown her old sling and hated it. Bought another new native and am thrilled. One of the absolute best purchases that I have made as far as baby gear goes."

I ordered it anyway, because good comments described the potty as one that would benefit my son. When it arrived (earlier than expected), I noticed that it was easy to assemble, and that because it is not made with very thick plastic, it probably wouldn't be a good idea to order this for BIG children who are potty training.  My son is 18 months old, and 22 lbs, and it is perfect for him, sturdy enough for him to climb up and use the potty.  He really enjoys climbing up himself, and it does encourage him to be more independent in the process.  I let him look at the box, and we talked about how the little girl was going potty, and he liked seeing the little girl on the box :) using the potty, ""just like him"".

I am a picky mother about toys. I hate toys that are too loud, too commercial, too cheesy, too useless...I have high standards. But Pupsqueak gets my ""picky mom seal of approval"" wholeheartedly. Here's why.

I am very blessed to have a mother who loves to send my children lots of goodies. While it's easy to know what to send a 4-year-old with distinct likes and interests, it can be harder to gauge what a twelve-week-old baby will enjoy. We have no shortage of toys and gadgets to entertain our new daughter with, and she clearly enjoys some of them, kicking legs, cooing, , waving arms, etc.

The Pupsqueak, however, took it to a different level. She LOVES this thing. We showed it to her around 11-12 weeks old, and she immediately reacted. She laughed, she kicked, all the signs. Then, she reached for the little black and white patterned bone that hangs down. We were so excited, and she's had it attached to the bar on her carseat ever since. The real test, however, was our 10-hour drive from Louisiana to Kentucky for the Thanksgiving holidays. But Pupsqueak came through for us with flying colors: anytime she would get fussy, I could reach back and shake him a bit so he would jingle softly, and she would be happy again. After my arm would get tired, I'd make sure he was adjusted where she could get at him, and she would, at not yet 4 months, bat at it herself.

Likes: love the easily adjustable belts - we often let the straps out a lot to get her in it without her being uncomfortable and then tighten it appropriately. The 5 point harness is great. Love that the car seat is compatible with different strollers. Dislikes: It doesn't recline as much as we'd like and the head padding is superficial. Our baby's head tends to fall forward a lot. The sun canopy seems like it was designed as an afterthought - it certainly works more than adequately, but doesn't move easily. Finally, the handle is difficult to move from position to position. Overall though, for the price, it's a good seat."

I read many things about complaints but I just don't have any. Everything works well on it. It doesn't fit well in all carts but carts weren't made for baby carriers to fit in them so it's not a bad thing about the car seat itself. All infant carriers will have the same problem. I recommend this to anyone who wants an infant carrier and likes how it looks. It's pretty and fits great in it's stroller. All in all, it's a great buy. Although my next time around, I'm passing up the infant carrier and going Britax. They're much safer imo from what I've read and heard"

Easy to install with the level indicator.  A few drawbacks:  Once my daughter was a few months old, it got really heavy to carry around.  She also outgrew it by 6 months.  The harness needs to be longer.  It doesn't release enough to get taller babies in and out comfortably.  And for some reason, the release levers to move the handle to get the baby in and out were really stiff and difficult to use.  My mother in law has arthritis and ended up having to either carry the carseat with both arms like a bundle of wood (because she couldn't move the handle up) or try to slide my daughter out of the top or bottom (because she couldn't move the handle back).  My advice, before you buy, realisticly test everything on it in the store and compare it directly to another brand"

The straps have adjusted easily as she's rapidly grown, I haven't had the adjustment problems other reviewers had.  The head support worked well too (at first we had to use a rolled towel inside it for her tiny head).  A baby's head will not fall forward as long as the seat is properly leveled according to the convenient indicator on the side of the seat, but if the angle is even slightly off this can happen easily.  The seat can only be leveled in the center seat of some sedan backseats (like my Toyota Camry) because of this angle requirement, but there are leveling accessories you can buy to help with this issue.  

Portability: I love the stay-in-car base, which I found easy to install properly.  It's also very easy to snap the carrier portion in and out, and very obvious whether the carrier is secure or not.  An extra base is great for families with multiple cars, as either parent can quickly snap the seat in and go.  The carrier portion is convenient for quick trips in and out of the car, but I find it much too heavy to comfortably carry long distances with a baby over 10 lbs (and I'm fairly strong).  It will not fit securely enough for my taste in the child seat portion of a grocery cart, but it does fit well when placed sideways across the larger basket portion; I just stash groceries in the large space left underneath the carrier and in the rest of the basket.
  The Snap n' Go stroller is great if you're taking this seat farther from your car.  It's much more lightweight than the large ""travel system"" Graco also sells with this seat.  It's easy to maneuver and comfortable for most people to push, but a little too short if you're much taller than 6 ft.

Durability: I can't comment on the seat's lifespan, as we've only been using it a little over 2 months.  A few times I have noticed the sticking carrier handle other reviewers mentioned, but it doesn't happen often.  The canopy seems rather flimsy to me, but we only use it occasionally when using the stroller, so it hasn't been an issue so far.

Other considerations: Windsor seems to be a fairly gender-neutral pattern, if this matters to you.  My baby wears a lot of yellow clothes, and people seem to assume she's a boy about 60% of the time when she's in this seat.  The carrier handle has several different positions: up for carrying, flat for carseat use, and down for resting the carrier portion on a flat surface without letting it wobble.  With the handle left up, the ""wobble-enabled"" carrier portion can be rocked slightly on the floor to stall a fussy baby as you try to finish an errand before she erupts.

I would buy this seat again.  Its only drawbacks are its weight (probably unavoidable since it's a carseat and must be sturdy) and the rather stringent placement requirement for leveling (but at least the indicator lets you know about this problem)"

The Baby Quiet Sounds works great as far as being able to hear the baby clearly. The receiver eats up the batteries fast and has some fed back with only batterie use. Our Graco does that too so I don't know if that is the norm with monitors. The sound is the best when pluged in. The nightlight is great. The humidity function I have not figured out as of yet. It say's it is 19% in every room and I don't know that is correct. The temp works fine. I have not played enough with it yet to set the controls and how it works.

Rawls ""Wappingers Falls, NY""",,"I've been using this pump for ten months now and it is the main reason I'm still nursing my little girl.  I went back to work when she was four months old and started pumping three times per day.  At first it was hard to try to be productive for the 20 minutes per session I was pumping because you really do have to hold the breast shield to the breast, suction isn't enough.  Then I got the Easy Expression Hands-free Bustier which has solved that problem.  I can now do e-mail, talk on conference calls, etc. while I'm pumping so I don't waste time at work and continue to give my baby the benefits of human milk.  I'm able to fit four standard bottles and two of the smaller/slimmer Medela bottles into the small cooler, with the ice pack so I don't think the cooler is too small.  Also, I don't think the cooler was meant to be transported in the backpack.  If you don't try to cram the cooler in the backpack there's no problem with storage in the backpack.  I also reccomend the Medela Micro-Steam bags for working moms who choose to pump once they go back to work. Also, I don't think the suction is too hard...yes it may be uncomfortable for the first minute or two until the pressure of engorgement has been reduced, but it is by no means painful.  Pain is what I experience when my daughter bites with her new razor-sharp teeth!

Boehmer,"Orange County, CA","I already have a single jogging stroller (not a BOB) and have been happy with it. We are in the process of adopting our second child, which we had less than 24 hours notice about, so a lot of money is going to legal costs, baby stuff, and my time off of work, and as a result I was concerned about spending this much on a stroller, but is was worth every cent. With the BOB Duallie, I am ecstatic, overjoyed, delighted, thrilled and looking forward to my next trip out. 

For my first trip out, I put my 2 year old and 11 week old in and went for a six mile walk. The trip was so smooth, both kids slept for most of the time. The seats recline enough so that my baby is nearly flat, no problems with his head bobbing around (pardon the pun). The shocks give this stroller an incredibly smooth ride, which transits to less work for my arms. I didn't realize how much effort went into the other stroller, pushing it and turning it. The smooth ride also allowed us to walk faster, a plus when trying to lose weight.

The stroller can turn in circles on itself, allowing for extremely sharp turns. Very nice, especially when inside a small store, like Starbucks. The windows up top are well placed enough that I can actually see my kid's face, not just their little bodies. The straps are the easiest to adjust of any stroller I've used. There is extra padding along the shoulder straps to cushion the kid's shoulders. The straps at the waist don't come out of the sides, (this is kinda hard to explain) the strap is attached in the center of the seat, and the sides come around the child, more like a belt and allowing for a snugger fit. Even my 70 year old mother had a great time pushing the stroller. 

As for the Mesa Orange, it is more like a burnt orange, with brown trim and I am very glad I got it! It is not at all like the neon orange it appears in some of the photos. Be sure to get the tray, I forgot to order it with the stroller. The storage is a little shallow, but being double wide, there is still plenty of room for stuff."

A friend gave me these at my baby shower because they were here favorite.  I wish I had never wasted money on the other pads.  I did have to change these pads more often than some of the other brands.  It was worth it because they were so much more comfortable.  I didn't have any chaffing like with most others.  Also they stayed in place ten times better than any pads with adhesive.

On the return flight we had to do more walking since the airport was a little bigger, though it was still a small airport. When I arrived at my destination the bag had completely separated along the bottom stitch and my car seat base had been scratched and mared as a result. The damage to the bag is so bad that I can never use it again. This bag should be labeled as disposable.

Even when she's not nursing or napping, the pillow helps me to support her weight when I'm sitting or standing. It fits me very comfortably even though I'm plus size.

The only drawback is that I need to order an additional slipcover because it can only be hung to dry, although it is machine washable. I really love this fabric, but apparently, this fabric is not available to purchase separately as a slipcover, so I guess I'll try the oatmeal twill cover."

First of all, if you want to be a satisfied customer you have to know what the purpose of the stroller is, which is for jogging, or maneuvering outdoors on rough terrain. My husband jogs with the stroller at least once a week ((and has no complaints)), but I on the other hand just adore it for the outdoors. The wheels go over almost any surface, including gravel, dirt, grass, concrete, brick, sand, boardwalk anything, I love it. The seats both fully recline ((individually)) and when they do, the rear of the seat is mesh so you can see your child from behind ((although you would most-likely have to bend down to get a good look)). The five-point harness on a jogger is a MUST HAVE, and this model even comes with comfortable pads as well. The basket is HUGE and holds everything we need for a day at the beach/park/walk around the block, which is very important to me. It is also removable, but I don't see why it would be advantageous to take it off. Plenty of other storage is available behind the seats as well, handy little pockets and pouches to store little knick-knacks. Considering the type of stroller it is, it folds very easily, and I can fit it in the rear of my minivan after removing the rear and front tires ((which is equally as easy to do, rear tires come off with the push of a button and the front has an easy to use release mechanism)). The canopy is enormous and proves for GREAT sun protection when needed! The breaks are FANTASTIC, and stop the stroller in its tracks which is very important if you are jogging, and need to stop quickly, according to my husband anyway. The included wind/rain shield is also very convenient ((can be left rolled up to the top of the canopy, incase there is a chance of rain you don't have to work for 5 minutes to attach it and get the kiddos wet)), but I do wish it also came with mesh covers for mosquitos and other bugs.

I do dislike the fact that it is EXTREMELY difficult to turn ((although I have kind of gotten it down to a science, you need to be prepared for the turn and tilt the stroller a bit, the turn is very wide and not that smooth)). I think it would be better if it had a swivel wheel which had the option to lock in place for jogging ((a swivel wheel would actually be extremely dangerous if jogging as you could lose control of the stroller)), but that's just me personally. The baskets are near impossible to access if both seats are reclined all the way, and I have had to wake sleeping babies on a few occasions ((that's why I have learned to put things such as my cell phone and wallet in the canopy pouches, so I don't have to constantly go into the basket)). The canopy is quite large, and if you are not using it its quite a pain to retract as it doesn't go back neatly, and if its a windy day the canopy doesn't always stay up.

If you are looking for a good stroller for outdoor use, and don't mind the large size or getting used to turning, then I highly recommend the Tike Tech"

Consumer Reports gave this and another seat the highest safety ratings (this seat had the highest rating of all Britax convertible seats!)

Also, it's really easy to tighten and loosen the straps, and the cover is really silky and comfortable. My son falls asleep within minutes of pulling out of the driveway.

My only gripes are that none of the existing toddler pillow neck/head supports fit into the seat, but that may be a problem with the manufacturers of the supports, not Britax. Also, the straps don't have soft covers to keep them from digging into my son's neck. I just bought some soft terrycloth ones from Babies R Us for $4.99. It works"

Kim,,"After reading the reviews and reluctantly we bought the stroller.  I am glad we didn't listen to those naysayers.  It was the best decision we made because the stroller is wonderful.  The comments people wrote about how the stroller is awkward and heavy is a bunch of rubbish.  Yes, the stroller is heavier than its predecessors but they fail to mention how sturdy it is.  We've had the stroller for 2 weeks and we hike up some hilly mountains (Stanford Dish if you are from Palo Alto) and it rides smoothly.  It gives me comfort that the stroller is well built and protecting our two daughters (2 year old and 4 weeks old enfant).  I feel secure that the stroller will not fall apart after a few rides like its predecessor.  Also, we love the capabilities, spring shocks for a smooth ride, shorter so we can navigate through some tight corners and it is not awkwardly long like the other double strollers.  We have a Toyota Sienna and it fits just fine in our back trunk.

As for the weight.  Yes, it is heavier but come on, it is not ""10"" times heavier.  People exaggerate too much.  If you are accustom to carrying your 30 pound toddler in your arms, then the stroller is nothing.  People are too much of a wimp.  It is slightly heavier than its predecessors but not by much.  They made it heavier because the load baring bar is what keeps the stroller steady and sturdy.  Gives me peace of mind that my precious asset in life (my two daughters) are protected. 

The only recommendation is that the back two wheels could squeak which can be annoying.  Just use Silicone spray and they all went away.  We've been through rain, dirt, and hot sun with this stroller and we've been so happy with it.  I highly recommend purchasing it.  but make sure you have a truck, mini-van, or SUV.  I am not sure if a standard vehicle can house such a stroller.  But I figured if you have two toddler/enfants, you may consider getting a bigger car"

I have used all kinds of bottles from the old glass bottles to Vent-air to Avent...many types with my first 3 children. I decided to give these a try considering I was tired of scrubbing bottles. My little girl switched to these very easily from the breast, it helped tremendously with her colic by cutting down on gas (switching from regular formula to soy helped to, plus I had to start avoiding all milk products while breastfeeding)plus they are so easy to clean and manage. I have had no leak problems like I did with Avent...Vent-air #1 nipple would collapse plus my son would have projectile spit-up after feedings when I tried to switch him to the #2 nipples (awful system)...absolutely no problems with the original Playtex bottles. My only minor complaint is trying to fit my fingers in the bottle to collapse the liner to rid of air...very hard if you do not have tiny hands. We bought the easy-feed bottles with the lift in the bottom to aid in releasing air...alittle easier. Store brand liners work just as well as brand name liners...I have seen no difference except in price. Target brand is very good. I would recommend these bottles to everyone"

We needed the gate (which already came with one extension panel) plus one more extension panel (we purchased additional) for a total of 107 inches across.  

It wasn't that horrible to install--just read the directions first and allot your self a couple of hours.  If you measure well and take your time, it's not that difficult.  Also best to attach it to a stud in the wall for xtra durability.

As for durability, you need an adult sized hand to open this latch--my almost 5-yr-olds can't do it.  The extra foot adds stability.  The baby has tried many times to push it over or break through the latch and never succeeds.  We like that you can set it to swing only one way if you choose, since it prevents it from smacking into our dining room chairs.

As for appearance, the neutral oak on this gate looks soooo much nicer than those pricier metal things.  We've received many compliments on our wide spaces gate (and matching stairwell gates) from guests, and it only takes seconds to slide out of the wall brackets and store if we're entertaining company.

I think some of the previous posters either had way too high expectations for a baby gate (it's not a brick wall!), or installed it wrong.  I would recommend this gate to anyone, especially those with multiples that need to gate off a portion of a large area to create a safe playspace"

Anderson ""momof2""",oregon,"I bought this seat a couple weeks ago and my 2 month old nephew is using it when I have him until my son is born in June. I love the look, style and safety of this seat. The only thing that I thought may be a problem was the way the shoulder straps adjust height. My nephew is 22"" and he is almost on the second to last adjustment. Also the side impacts don't leave alot of room for a head positioner for newborns and they are far enough apart for the head to have room to wobble side to side. My nephew seems to love it though and seems really comfortable in it. The upright position is something I like, I have never seen him sweat in it, he seems to have growing room, the canopy covers him fine, and I think it is the most comfortable to carry. His parents are using an Eddie Bauer and I know alot of people (including me in the past) that use Graco and other brands and they seem roomier, but not as safe. Also I haven't seen a baby over 4-5 months in the infant seats anyways, I don't know anyone that would want to lug around a baby over 15 pounds in an infant seat, I guess that's just the few of us who aren't body builders. My nephew is 11 pounds now and he is getting pretty heavy in the seat, it's a good thing that the seat isn't too heavy itself. I would recommend this seat, but I can't explain the other reviews, so mabey trying it out in the store is best for everyone"

However, if he's in the mood, he can easily dismantle the entire contraption - so it won't work to keep an older child from tearing it apart if they want to.  In fact, the two end panels had to be removed because he wouldn't leave them alone.

Also, I like the breathable netting since baby can see out through it and since it ""gives"" a bit when baby pushes and kicks it. We have a nonstandard length crib (Babee Tenda), so we do have small gaps at each end of the rail, but we had read about this issue in another review from a Babee Tenda crib owner, so we knew up front we would have these gaps. These small gaps have not been a problem for us as our baby doesn't seem to want to stick her legs through the gaps in this location (I think it's difficult since she would have to lie almost flush with the headboard or footboard to do so). The white satin edge is very pleasant to look at. Overall I like this product much more than the traditional bumpers I have seen."

This pump is the best in its class and it is the best thing I bought in 2006.

Why I gave this item 5-star ratings:-

1) It helped me to establish a steady milkflow from the 2nd week of breastfeeding.  I am a working mom and had only 8 weeks off from delivery till I have to get back to work again.  So it was important for me to rely on a good breast-pump to keep the supply going.  

2) This pump is comfortable to use and I can regulate the speed which is suitable for me.  The Medela parts are easy to set up for usage and also easy to wash & sterilise.

3) It never breakdown ever!  For 4 months now, and I'm pumping 4 - 5 times a day.  I bring this unit to the office and also whenever I am travelling.  It is very mobile, although a little heavy to carry.

4) It has a battery pack which is handy whenever I am in a place without power-supply.

5) I bought this online in Amazon for USD$ 319.  But in Malaysia, this unit would have cost MYR1800 (USD$ 500).  

Just a note for non-US users (like myself), you need to get an adapter which is compatible with this pump.  This can be easily obtained from any electrical shops.

This is a good buy, if you're looking for a pump, then you have found it!"

Conrad ""Andy's Mom""","Atlanta, GA","We've had this bed rail for about two months now for our 3 1/2 year old on his full size ""big boy bed"".  We're quite satisfied with it.  

Construction:  Very sturdy, our son jumps on his bed and rolls around and the bed rail stays put and does not seem like it could possibly give way.  The mesh is soft which is good for the times when he wedges himself in the corner to sleep.  We tug on it from time to time and it's not going anywhere.

Assembly:  Not too easy, the instructions are horrible, but once you realize on your own how it's supposed to go, the actual assembly is OK, but not quick.  Very easy to adjust the width to your bed with the simple strap feature.  

Hide away feature:  This is what took away the 5th star.  It's not very easy to unlock and push it under the bed. That feature works but requires some wrangling.  If you want the hide away feature for once in a while, I wouldn't let that stop you from buying it, if you plan to hide the rail daily, I don't recommend it for that.

Making the bed:  Easy to tuck the sheets around it, no need to hide away or struggle.

Overall, I would highly recommend this bed rail, I read all the reviews, and asked many friends, and this seemed to be the best in all areas, and a good value for the price, considering other can be well over $xx"

Rocks. BOB is very high quality and has held up extremely well for us after nearly 2 years of use. We're a little attached to BOB in our house. Let me tell you the Revolution is the stroller to get. We bought it right after our baby was born, choked up $40 or so for the infant seat bar and have used it as our primary stroller ever since. Even in the mall, department stores, etc it's great. Baby gets a smooth ride and daddy likes it because it's agile and almost effortless to push. I see hundreds of Bugaboo strollers around and I must admit they are nice but B.O.B is my choice because of price and you can go more places with him. 

Our other seldom used stroller is a Graco something or other and I don't even know where it is. However I've used it enough to compare it to BOB when collapsing it and putting it in the car. I must say BOB is easier and faster to fold and go.

One downside might be that the storage compartment under the seat is smaller than some of those jumbo strollers. However, BOB is built like a tank. We travel with BOB a lot through airports (Yes BOB fits through most airport XRAY's while normally collapsed but sometimes I have to take off the back wheels which is easy) and we hang stuff off of BOB's handlebars and even carry our jumbo car seat on top of the sun shade until we get to our car.

Our family is now looking for a double or tandem stroller. This get's interesting because I don't see us doing the duallie BOB Revolution since it's a no-go in the mall, Target, etc. The Phil & Ted's E3 Buggy and Double Buggy are looking tempting but I don't like that the older child sits tucked behind the stroller.. They can't see anything. What I wish B.O.B. Corp would do is come up with an attachment to at least do the same as the Phil & Ted's..... But a tandem stroller that was a revolution would be sweet!"

Downs,"NJ, USA","We got this chair as a baby shower gift, which I registered for and absolutely love it!  I don't understand the problems the other reviewers are talking about.  If used properly, this chair gives absolutely no problems.  The seat locks in at different levels, if it's not locked in, of course it will fall apart.  

The seat is easy to use, folds easily, and cleans easily.  We store it in our van (we have Stow-and-go storage) and it fits perfectly!

We've used it since my son, now 16 months, could sit up.  He lays his body from side to side and the seat doesn't budge...very safe.  The tray does snap off easily, and he has done that at times while trying to climb up on it.  This doesn't bother me, since it's not a 'toy' and shouldn't be climbed on anyway.  The tray hasn't snapped off while in use, and hopefully won't!  

We've used this chair on both a chair, and the floor when seating was limited (like at family get togethers).  We haven't had any problems at all.

Anyway, I highly recommend it.."

Hubble,,This is the best product we have ever used for our little girl (yes that includes swings and bouncy seats). I stumbled across it when they had just come out. She was sitting in it at 4 months. BY the time she started crawiling though we couldnt use it because she was able to twist herslef and climb out of it. However... I see now that they have an attachment for it so it can be used for self feeding. I recommend this to everyone we know who is starting their family or already have had a child. It allows the caregiver to be hands free and it helps your little one learn to be more independant faster (which is a double edged sward! Tough fro parents good for kids).

Does what it should, but could be improved! I give it 3 1/2 stars!","March 19, 2007",H. Moss,"SLC, Utah","VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: DOT NOT TURN ON SYSTEM BEFORE READING THIS. 
You have to open up the parent receivers and plug in the battery pack before usage, then Charge the system for 16 hours. DO NOT TURN SYSTEM ON WHILE CHARGING FOR THIS FIRST TIME!!! 

I did a lot of research on monitors and found this one to have pretty good feedback on several parents' websites. With most items, there are pros and cons... see below: 

Pros: 
-You will not pick-up any feedback from the neighbors. This is a significant improvement from monitors in the past. ABSOLUTLY NO INTERFERENCE! 
-Great reception. You will have no problems picking up your child with this. I can take it outside and work in the yard, with confidence that I will know when my baby needs me. 
-Interchangeable AC power cords make it easy to move the system around to different rooms in the house. 
-Lightweight and compact system. 

Cons: 
-The biggest issue is battery life. HORRIBLE BATTERY LIFE, TYPICALLY ONLY 3-4 HOURS at a time! The battery drain on this system is almost a deal breaker in my husband's opinion. This system comes with the options of 1 or 2 docking stations, I HIGHLY RECOMMED the one with two stations because the system is constantly running low on batteries and and can recharge while the parents portion is on the dock. Or the second receiver can be used while the other is charging on the dock. 
-With any power interruption the child's unit shuts off. The parents unit beeps and flashes red to inform you of the issue, but it can be irritating at 2:00 A.M. to have to get up to turn it back on. Graco really needs to find a way to have the system stay on at all times that it is plugged in. 
-Belt clip does not work well with normal amount of movement. The system is better left unattached to belt, unless you want to be constantly picking it up from the ground. 
-A bit expensive.

A little of both... Pros/Cons: 

-Sound: Pro: Great sound, very clear. In fact I can often hear dogs barking outside with this monitor. Con: Picks up on every little sound because it is so sensitive. For the light sleepers, on the softest level still can be very loud. 
-Loud, every 5 seconds, parents warning: Pro: Beeping will let you know that system is not functioning correctly so you can fix the system. This was nice for us one day when the baby's system had fallen and came unplugged. If the system had not beeped, we would not have known. Con: Annoying beeping while searching for signal... a startling fact in the middle of the night. 

*Overall the system does what it should, but there a few area's that could be improved. I gave it 3 1/2 stars but rounded it up.*"

It takes 5-10 minutes to get the same amount it took 30 minutes to get with the Medela, and it doesn't hurt your hand at all because you have to pump the handle far less often because of the massaging petals, and because you use it for less time total.

He watches the flashing lights, listens to the music and noises, and seems to like the different shaped blocks (we have several other peek-a-boo blocks).  He uses the handle to push the bus, flips up the shape sorter and kicks at the wheels to make the music come on.  It keeps his attention while he practices sitting up for long periods of time.

We thought at first we had a broken one since only one light worked and it didn't flash.  Well after my husband pounded the light bar down on each side both lights came on and started flashing.  It also made the hood stay shut better.  So maybe try that before taking it back to the store if you encounter the same problem"

It is the law in my state that children must in a booster or car seat until age 8. The seat material is high quality and the cushioning is very comfotable. The headrest is perfect for long trips since my son can fall asleep without an annoying crick in his neck. The price is decent too.

The only issue I have with this seat is the cupholders. If you have a regular sedan and want to fit others in your car, the cupholders aren't very usable. Additionally, the cupholders don't slide out very well when the child is sitting in the seat. Personally, I leave the cupholders pushed in. I have another carseat for a young infant in my sedan and must fit my 10-year old in the back seat. 

I wish carseat and booster seat makers would instead make a mesh bag pocket hang right off the botton front for kid toys and such. Furthermore, with booster seats in general, I think they are very impractical for families who need to fit 3 kids across the backseat. My son has a very hard time buckling his seat belt because he must reach to the side where space is at a premium.

I would love a forward-facing booster seat with a 5-point harness that would lock into the LATCH loops for the older child. Not only is a 5-point seat harness safer but it is much easier for a child to buckle themselves instead of reaching around to the side.

As far as the options available for a child who has outgrown a convertible seat but is too small for a regular seat belt, this is a nice option."

Additionally, the Buggy Bag is among the few that covers the whole cart, and (uniquely) adds further protection from germs with 2 separate belts: one to go around your child's waist, the other to secure it to the cart.

Not to be forgotten: the Buggy Bag comfortable (apparently!), has simple convenient storage options and stores itself w/ ease!

On the other hand, I tried one imitation in a popular Baby store and not only did it not open with one hand (a necessity with a baby on your hip in a grocery store parking lot!) but I could NOT get it back into its 'carrying' shape with two hands!!  I hid it on the shelf and moved away quickly.  eek.  Another product I purchased online came in two pieces and had so many clips and belts wrapping it together, that I could barely attach it with both hands and help from passersby. While it had 'shoulder straps unlike any other, they dont work in most carts that put an advertising placard on the back of the cart seat.  Finally adjusted, that product (the ""Shop'n'Dine"") didnt cover most of the cart. (on its debut shopping trip) I threw it back in the car and went home, too tired to shop.

Finally, there are lots of imitators out there, dont be suckered in by similar names, better price points or preferred fabric choices:  the Buggy Bag will preserve your sanity and, perhaps, your child's health."

It kept the seat clean (and we even had plenty of airline staff commend us on even thinking to bag our seat to keep it clean), but obviously did nothing to make it easier to tote around the airport.

Then I found out about car seat carriers, and chose this one as it had the most favourable reviews. It was purchased just before a trip to Colorado, and has since also been to Europe and back. 

I'm extremely happy with this item. It's relatively easy to put our convertible Evenflo car seat into, and the canvas and zippers have held up well, with no obvious signs of wear yet, even after braving the luggage belts.

The only tip I can give people is that my husband and I found that the car seat has a tendency to wobble or tip over more when pulled in a more upright position (much like small wheelie carry on luggage), and was more stable to pull when you had it leaning backward quite far, so that it's center of gravity is lower. So you might need/be able to use the strap that comes with it or something else to attach to the handle so that you have some extra length to tip it back further. Both my husband and I were a little too tall for just the handle to do that comfortably. 

For anyone looking for a way to more easily take their carseat along, I definitely recommend this product"

I have one bathroom, and one very messy boy who never lifts the toilet seat. This has saved me from having to clean my toilet seat constantly or face unwelcome surprises. I do have to check the collection reservoir a lot, though, because my older son does ""go"" a lot, as big boys will. The flushing mechanism works well and is a necessary part - it saves a lot of time you may spend scrubbing and rinsing a traditional training potty. Plus, the pee collects in a part of the potty the child doesn't have easy access to, unlike a trainer potty that they can pee in, then stand up and step in or put on their head when your back is turned for a second (I speak from experience). Makes it much more sanitary.

The only problems I've encountered are my kids flushing it constantly (mostly when it was new), simultaneously filling the collection reservoir and draining the water and therefore creating two jobs for me to repeat every five minutes, the fact that my three-year-old still can't quite get it that he can't sit on it and do #2, and the fact that it's just a little off-balance, so unless you wall-mount it or lean it up against a wall, you could have an icky mess.

My only gripe is that since the bottles are so wide they cover the whole lower part of her face and it smooshes her nose.  There isnt a curve in the bottle, so when the milk gets low you either have to lean the baby back more, which I dont like, or either mash the bottle on her nose.  Its avoidable, but I tend to do it whithout realizing sometimes.  Id rather just stick with a bottle like playtex with a curver or a bottle that is slimer.

I was strolling the baby aisle in Target when I saw these and was thrilled.  In the store the 3 pack of 5 oz bottles was half of what they are here on amazon.  I love the width of the bottles because it's super easy to add in formula and make sure everything is really clean.  The lid also snaps onto the bottom which helps keep them from mysteriously disappearing.

While it would be nice to have a few more features like total ounces drank, whether the diaper was a wet one or a doodie, and tracking of daily totals for everything - that'd be more of a infantcare PDA, and is a bit beyond the scope of this little device.  All it aims to be is a timer that will keep track of the key stats in your baby's life, consequently making your life way easier.  I wake up in middle of the night and the baby is grunting, for example.    I click the backlight button and see that in fact the baby has only been asleep for an hour, and had a diaper and bottle right before that.  Then I just go back to sleep.  On the other hand, he beguns grunting and making noises and I see the Itzbeen says it's been 2 hours 30 minutes since his last bottle or diaper, and I know it's time to get up and feed him.

It's also great for team caregiving, as my husband can hand me the Itzbeen after doing his morning shift, and I automatically know when the last change and bottle were.  We use the wildcard button to track bottle expirations too.

Thumbs up for the developers of this cool gadget - I hope to see an ""Itzbeen II"" w/ some advanced features in time for my next baby - although keeping it simple does help keep it easy and quick to use, especially in the fog of a 1am, 3am, and 5am feeding schedule!

The bright yellow velour pelican ties onto the crib railing.  His fat cheeks squeak, his wings crinkle, and his feet rattle.  He comes with four sea creatures (crab, shrimp, fish, and octopus) that are each different textures and colors, and make different sounds (rattle, rustle, etc.).  Children can put the little animals into pelican's mouth and watch them drop down into his tummy.  The large circular tummy opening allows for easy removal of the animals so play can begin all over again.

I found that babies enjoy quietly investigating the sounds, colors, and textures of the four little sea creatures.  Toddlers progress to the eating game.

I am grateful to Mr. Pelican for allowing me an extra half hour of sleep every morning.  What can be better than that!

My husband and I went to the mall last weekend and were waiting for an elevator, instead of waiting in the long line, my husband carried our 1yr old, and I carried the stroller up the stairs while it was fully opened.  It was a breeze!  We did the same thing when we left the mall, only this time I collasped the stroller, the carrying handle on it makes it super easy to carry up or down stairs.  It's still winter, so I haven't had much of a chance to test out the sun shade, but hopefully that will work out ok.  I would reccomend this stroller to anyone, infact I've told two of my girlfriends about it, and they have already added it to their gift registry.  You will be happy with this stroller"

If he is fussy and I don't really know why, it is so easy to put him in here and take the kids for a walk.  The only drawback is that it is a bit comebersome, so I wouldn't use it if I was only going to have it on for a few minutes.

Arsenault ""PhD Mommy""",MA,"My daughter is breastfed, but we introduced a bottle around 3 weeks to ensure that she would take one (with pumped milk and/or formula).  We originally bought Avent bottles and had no problems until all of a sudden at 2-1/2 months she went bonkers!  Refused to drink from the bottle.  Granted we had be a bit lax on giving her bottles (not every day, but at least once per week).  I tried a Dr. Browns and it was the same problem.  And it didn't matter if it was breastmilk, forumula, warm, cold, room-temp, etc.  She just screamed!

during this time, she had been using a Platex ortho pacifier, but had begun using the soothie pacifer I got from the Hospital.  She didn't like the soothie pacifier at all to begin with...took several months for her to like it.  Anyway, I randomly had a freebie Soothie bottle from motherhood maternity in the drawer that I thought I might as well try.  she took it immediately!!

I have since bought several more in preparation for daycare, and she still takes them with no problems (she's 4 months now).  I have not had any problem with leaks, and in fact she stays much much cleaner with this bottle than she did with Avent.  

My only problem, is there is no disc to put underneath the nipple when transporting or mixing in the bottle.  However, the stage 1 nipples are pretty slow, so as long as its kept upright it does okay.  I have been using my old avent bottle with sealing discs as milk transport and pouring into the Soothie to feed. "

I really like it cuz the quality is superb and we're very very happy with. In fact we bought another one from amazon, for my son. My kids are 12 months apart so we needed another crib for him since now hes 1. He likes it a lot too. But even though company and everything is the same. the crib did come with some damaging to it, but it wasnt that bad, you dont really notice it, we got lucky i guess. But i do plan to just paint over the parts where the white paint has come off. The quality also seems different it doesnt seem as dense as the first one I bought. I dont know whether the manufacturing has changed or its quality issues. But overall its a nice crib I just wish it came in better condition and that it was the same wood feeling as the first one.

Hancock,,"The crib just the way it comes is best.  A thicker mattress would be bad for 2 reasons.  Firm is best to avoid suffocation dangers.  Bumber pads are also recommended against by *all* modern advice sites and classes.  SIDS deaths appear to be related to suffocation, and this happens usually when the baby's mouth and nose are against padding.  Firm mattress (like this very thin one) are much safer.  The main thing is to always lay the infant on it's back to sleep, and not on it's belly.  Also, never use a bumber padding in *any* crib for any very young child.  Finally, there is also the issue of ""outgassing"" of any kind of waterproof plastic type matress covers and foam filling.   What you want, if you can't afford the very expensive natural options, is a *thin* mattress like this one, that won't have a lot of material to outgas, thus reducing the exposure of your baby to these common somewhat toxic VOCs.  Best is to buy this a few weeks (or longer) ahead of time, and then air out the mattress.  I'm even putting ours in the clothes dryer on low heat just past the switch off point, so that the drying heats it up a little and then clicks off the heat and continues exhausting air past it until the end of cycle.  This is my own idea of how to accelerate the outgassing, so that our new baby in January won't have much VOCs to breath."

I had no trouble assembling it at all. From the first time I used ISIS I've had great success. I am able to pump several ounces in 15 minutes, without any pain or discomfort as I control the suction. Our daughter does not have any problems switching from bottle to breast at all, nor have we ever experienced bottles/nipples leaking. I assemble the pump and the nipples/rings when they are just out of the sterilizer and are still wet. I love how easy this is to use and I don't have to find a place to plug it in at work.

It's a terrible combination.  Carying the baby in this seat should be a task for husbands for several months as I found out too late.

Back to the seat, it works quite well in the car and with the baby trend snap-n-go. We use the snap-n-go quite often and it prevents you from repeatedly removing your child from the seat and snapping him back in (which can be trying for you and your kid).

I was disappointed the unit had no SPF rating for the sun shade. That feature may not have made it to child seats but sun protection is extremely important for babies and it wouldn't be difficult to use a protective fabric.  I called Baby Trend and they had no idea if and how well the shade actually blocked harmful UV rays.  Other seats may not have this feature either but we will look closely for it in the future after being sternly warned by the child safety class at the hospital.  Babies have super sensitive skin and it's important to avoid any direct sunlight if possible. I know it sounds extreme and alarmist but it also should be very easy to do and is recommended by the American Adadamy of Pediatrics ([...]). For now, you would need an additional cover on top of the included cover.

Pros: Consumer report top pick, not as expensive as some

Cons: No SPF rating or sun UV protection listed for sun shade. Heavy and non ergonimic to cary by hand (not a complaint specific to this particular seat, they probably all are)"

I never had the quilt in the crib because it is dangerous to do so with a baby - and he was constantly napping, so I hardly ever ""made"" the bed.  Next time around, I'm going to find a pattern I like and just buy all of the decorative things associated with it, then buy an inexpensive and plain bumper and sheet. The room itself is what you and everyone else sees.  The bedding is almost impossible to see, unless you're hovering over the crib.

However, the helpful hint I have to give comes from my other half who already has a son and has used a wipe warmer. He said the wipe warmers that heat from the bottom up (heat ALL of the wipes) are a waste of money because by the time you get to the bottom wipes....they are dried out from being continuously reheated. They basically lose their moisture which defeats the purpose of a wipe in the first place and you end up throwing a bunch of them out without the benefit of using them first. We opted to go with this one because it seems to be smaller (more convenient for travel which we will do a fair amount of) and it heats just the first few wipes which is usually all you need for a diaper change. Some mothers would say this is not really a necessary thing to have (after all, babies lived through diaper use just fine before these things were invented), but because our baby will be born during the winter, I thought this would have more use for us. I gave this product four stars because we haven't tried it yet....but just wanted to pass that helpful hint along to other mothers who are interested in practicality and saving money and hopefully not losing quality in the process"

Drees ""bigPIMA""","Las Vegas, NV","Despite some negative reviews I got this seat because I have an 8 mth and 2.5 yr old and my husband is deployed so bathtime can be very challenging. I also have a textured bathtub bottom so I knew a bathring would not work. 

Well this seat is fantastic - my baby loves to sit in it and tries to grab all of the bath toys so he can chew on them. Also, whenever I get the baby in the toddler wants to jump in too which is so much easier then conjoling an ornery 2 yr old into the tub. Since using the bath seat my infant hasn't scraped his legs on it once like some other reviewers mentioned so not sure what that is about. And although he has tried to climb out a couple of times he is usually content to sit there. Of course even with this seat you can't let such little ones bathe unsupervised anyways so it is fine when he tries to get out - I just put him back and he is happy. Even when I don't bath the two together I put the little one in here - just makes it so much easier then trying to hold him steady (he is such a wiggler - trying to crawl/stand immediately)and having my hands free to scrub him. To clean his bottom I just pull him out clean him and then stick him back in - no problem. To clean the seat I've followed the advice of other posts and again no problem.

I actually came back here to buy one for my sister but I see that it isn't available right now -boo - I'll have to find it elsewhere.

I bought it for her so that she could nap on it while my M-I-L is over watching her since she has a hard time with stairs and lifting toddler into high crib.  

She sleeps on it for about 1 1/2 - 2 hours in the afternoon, which is about 1 hour shorter than if she were to nap in her crib inside her (darkened) room.  

It suits this purpose well and I intend on taking it on overnight weekend trips so we don't have to haul her port-a-crib.  

The only disadvantage is that she can get out of it, of course, but... it's a cot! 

She began daycare recently and sleeps on their cots for the same amount of time, so I figured I'd buy it for my M-I-L at home.  It does the trick and my baby thinks it's special.  I tell her that it's only for when Grandma S is over (b/c she wanted to start sleeping/napping in it all the time).  

Naturally, I'd prefer she take a longer nap, so I told her it's for special days only, when Grandma S is here.  So now she uses it to ""tuck in"" her bunny-bear stuffed animal before she goes to her room at night.  

I love it, and it seems comfortable, very portable and handy.  I would recommend it.  

The only reason I'm not rating it 5 stars is that I have yet to use it on a weekend trip, but I wanted to review it now, in case you were wondering whether or not to get it.  I think it's very much worth it, but everyone's different.  It's relatively small and inexpensive so if your child hates it they may like it for their stuffed animal friends.

Also, it is very sturdy & supportive and opens and collapses with no trouble at all.

Hope that helps"

Clark,,"I was a diehard graco fan.  When my daughter was born 2002 the Graco Snugride was the top rated infant seat (I put a lot of stock into what consumer reports has to say).  The infant seat was great and we got it as part of the travel system.  I loved both the stroller and seat, and was very sad when she outgrew the seat around 1 years old.  I tried an Eddie Bauer convertible seat next and it was horrible, the straps always twisted and my daughter's head always fell forward onto her chest when she fell asleep.  I quickly changed the Graco Comfortsport (the one with the overhead drop down bar) and she loved it.  It had more padding, her head rested on the side of the carseat instead of her chest and the straps never twisted.  It was easy to get in and out and not too heavy to lug around in airports.  When she outgrew that seat I decided to make the switch to Britax.  Although the Roundabout was rate #1 on CR I went with the Marathon because the only thing CR didn't like about it was the infant latch (which I wouldn't need as my child was 3yrs old) and it had a higher weight limit than the Roundabout.  I own a Honda Accord 4 door and my husband drives a 4 door Toyota Echo (tiny).  The seat fits perfectly well in both vehicles in the forward facing position.  The Toyota has latch and the Honda doesn't but in both cars it doesn't move.  Partly due to the fact that my husband is excellent at installing and partly due to the car seats weight.  It is quite heavy, and it can be a pain to haul around airports.  My husband usually just loosens the straps and wears it like a backpack through the airport.  My daughter loves it, (we have a girly print, not the granite) it has plenty of room for her, she never is uncomfortable sleeping in it (her head doesn't sit on her chest either), and though she's a very bright 4 year old she's never been able to get out of the seat.  I love the fact that she can be in it until she's 65lbs with the five point restraint and the straps never twist.  Britax also does thoughtful things like adding velcro on the sides of the seat to hold the straps in place when you're putting your child in and having a padded area under the clip so your child isn't burned by the hot plastic in the summer (or freezing in the winter).  I plan on staying with Britax from here on out"

Silva ""seattlefamily""","Seattle, WA","This is a wonderful stroller.  I'm so glad I took a chance and ordered it, sight unseen.

I ordered the red version, which is much snazzier in person than on the Amazon picture.

It is fairly lightweight - much lighter than our Graco model, but heavier than those cheap little umbrella strollers, nice and sturdy.  But it folds up in an umbrella fashion, so it won't take up too much room in your trunk and could be carried, if necessary.

It comes with neat things like a rain cover, sun shade, and cold weather boot.  The rain and shade covers are neatly contained in an attachable pouch and the boot fits easily in the stroller's basket.

The canopy has a window, provides lots of shade, and is even partially removable to let the breeze run through on a balmy day.  Coolest of all, it has a built in mesh pouch that doesn't take up any room but still manages to hold everything I need: sunscreen, hand sanitizer, wallet, keys, cell phone, and sunglasses.  It's stretchy mesh, so if you don't have anything it just lies flat against the hood.  But it does have a plastic lining, so it's waterproof!  Also, it zips, so your things can't fall out and aren't accessible to your two year old, either.

The basket is large enough for a medium sized diaper bag, although a small bag would fit best, especially if you want to keep the boot in there.

The best part is that everything is snazzy.  Everything looks nice, the materials feel great, and it's well designed.  The parts that should be removable/washable are.

It's a snap to put together (took just a couple of minutes) and everything locks into place in a smart way.  It's very easy to fold and unfold.  Also, it reclines beautifully and easily, including into a totally upright position.  I became frustrated that my Graco model's most upright position was still too reclined for our one year old.    

The place where your child's legs hang down is neat.  It is adjustable, so it could stick straight out, hang down, or even flip up for a very little one (maybe to use with the boot?)...  Your kid won't get a weird stroller mark on the underside of their little knees.

It has the newer style which I notice most new strollers seem to have where you only have to clip two things in to buckle a baby in.  My Graco model (purchased last year) is such a complicated mess.  You attach two things together on one side, two things together on the other side, then connect each side into the center.  Arg!  My son almost always fussed by the time I'd finished.  Also, he was always sitting on one of the straps, which easily became twisted.  My husband STILL has not figured out how to do this quickly.  :)  So this is a big improvement.

It's also comfy!  I can't vouch for that myself, of course.  But my son settles down into it and looks perfectly comfortable.  With the Graco model, he ended up with his legs flung over one side of the tray and if he wasn't tightly belted in he slouched down a lot.

A few minor imperfections about the Zooper Twist.  

The cupholder is a mesh bag attached to the handle.  It works well for a standard water bottle or something, but one of those giant mall-sized beverages might not be so great.  You can easily remedy this by investing in a good quality cup attachment, if that is important to you.

This stroller is great for me - I'm 5'5.  It would be nice if the stroller handles were adjustable.

This isn't a jogging stroller.  It does offer a nice feature where you can lock the front two wheels so they do not swivel, which makes going over rough surfaces safer and easier to manage.

This isn't the kind of stroller that is going to hold everything but the kitchen sink, if you are looking for that kind of stroller.  There isn't a cup and snack tray for your child.  No clock.

This is just the greatest stroller and I'm so glad to dump our awful Graco stroller.  Hated. that. thing.  This is snazzy, well designed, handy, lightweight, convenient, and offers everything we need"

I was concerned that it would be too large for my car (I have a Honda Civic), but it fit just fine. Rear-facing you would need to put in the center of the back seat, so if you have 2 kids, you would have to put the seats up further, but if you are short, that will likely not be an issue. I had it installed at the fire station and it fit in perfectly -- he installed it in minutes and did NOT need any foam pieces to make it fit properly! It was a perfect fit on its own.

Pros: 
1. it is the best car seat you can get!
2. has side impact protection -- also makes a good headrest when baby falls asleep
3. the adjust knob for the harness is awesome to adjust especially over large coats
4. the seat is very well cushioned, soft fabric
5. fits fine a small car even rear facing (I have a Civic)
6. it's heavy so its not going anywhere!
7. works for up to 65 pounds, so we will get a lot of use out of the seat
8. she loves it!

Cons:
1. it is large/heavy (though it is staying in my car so heavy is not a problem)
2. the strap to tighted the harness is a little tough to pull tight on a smaller child, but you need to pull straight out and not up
3. it is expensive

I highly recommend this seat (we have the Onyx fabric). It is large, heavy and expensive, but it is the best!! I had buyer's remorse for a few minutes, but I figured it is the best seat on the market right now and $300 is a small price to pay for protecting my daughter. I did a lot of research before buying and felt confident in my decision and in the seat! Very pleased with this seat! Also, please make sure you get your seat installed by a certified technician (Check with your local Children's Hospital). Improperly installed car seats and improper use of car seats is the leading cause of death among children and infants. Something very easy to prevent"

Brady,"University Heights, OH","Our 8-month-old daughter outgrew her infant carrier, and we needed a ""big girl"" car seat immediately.  I knew that we were going to purchase a car seat made by Britax because they are always consistently highly rated in crash tests and by other safety measures.  After reading reviews and checking out the Roundabout, Marathon and Boulevard seats in the store, we decided on the Boulevard.  I love the added protection the side-impact wings provide.  True, it is just about the most expensive car seat out there, but I believe it is well worth the price.

The only drawback was that I found none of the fabric options particuarly appealing.  I finally settled on Brownstone because I believe it to be the least dreadful of them all.  I was surprised to find that it is not as bad as I had imagined.  It is extremely soft (almost has a chenille-like feel) and does not get too hot (even in direct sunlight).  There is also the option of ordering different covers, if I tire of this one.

This car seat is pretty big, but it fits just fine in our Honda Accord (in the  middle of the back seat), and two normal-size people can easily fit on either side.  It was very easy to install using the LATCH system.  I have not had any problems or complaints.

My daughter seems very comfortable in her new car seat, and I feel safe with her in it"

It is easy to attach to the portable crib and holds very securely. My only negative comment is that it's a little difficult to put together- I usually keep it assembled and throw it in my trunk to save time and my sanity.

We have a Trailblazer and it installed easily and we can see him great even over his Britax Marathon carseat. It has been great for road trips (our son was entertained even on a 9-hour trip) and has been a blessing for short trips to the store. We don't always use the music/lights but the mirror is always handy. We have never had trouble with it being too soft. I have given this as shower gifts and my friends have been pleased as well. Def. recommended.

I love all Kiddapotamus products, that I bought so far because they are well-done, thoughtful and win awards all the time - but best of all, they are really very handy.

We went to a restaurant and for the first time we could put our sons food right on the placemat on the table so that he could feed himself. Without that mat, we had to hold onto the food or but a napkin underneath - so one of us was always busy with our son instead of enjoying a dinner out. The placemat comes with a scoop that holds most of the food that our son will drop from his mat and the floor was still clean after we left. Best of all with this mat we can provide a germfree space for him to sit, eat and play - on our table. He was really happy about it.

After our visit we rolled this wonderful placemat together and put it in my handbag.

I was really satisfied"

Now, as she's older and eating some puffs and other finger foods, it's great b/c I can put the food directly on her mat and the cup catches the leftovers!  
I keep ours in a large ziploc bag in my diaper bag so when it's dirty it doesn't get everything else dirty.
It's such a simple concept product, but so GREAT!

The description doesn't do the bag justice as it has many features not shown in any of the photographs.  To start there is a large back pocket to put all of your changing needs, which is quick and easy to access.  The heart of the bag contains ample room with six pockets total; two elastic pockets on one side and 4 layered pockets on the other.  There is also a front flap with a magnetic closure with one zippered pocket on the outside and a wallet organizer on the inside...the perfect area for mom's stuff.  There is a cell phone compartment on the front of the bag and a bottle pocket on each side of the bag.  The construction and material are very sturdy and everything closes up nicely so there is no risk of spilliage.  Finally, the graphite and green is very unisex, where many diaper bags are not so father friendly.  I am so pleased with this bag and the price is unbeatable!   "

Glass,"Atlanta, GA","Before my daughter was born, I knew I was determined to breastfeed her.  I read several books and asked a lot of moms what their breastfeeding must-haves were.  Several people mentioned this nursing stool.  I was doubtful about how helpful a little stool could actually be, but I also wanted every resource possible available to help my breastfeeding relationship go smoothly, so I went ahead and bought it.  In the weeks prior to my daughter's birth, my husband assembled the stool and I would use it to prop up my aching feet after a long day at work.  After my baby was born, I set up a little nursing station in my living room, and I found the stool to be an essential item.  Basically it lifted my knees to just the right angle to help prop the baby in the correct position.  I also used a nursing pillow, and between the pillow and the stool, the whole experience was actually very comfortable.  I was able to nurse for long periods of time without feeling any pain or stress from holding the baby in the right position.  I am definitely holding on to this item for use with future babies, and I would recommend it to any new mom who plans to nurse her baby"

Pros - good price, easy to operate. Mine are very easy on the batteries, I replace them about every 2 months. They are located on the kid's bedroom doorways, about 8' apart from each other. We use them as a double safety for the top of the stairs, and to keep the roaming 22 month old out of his sister's room when she wants some quiet time. 

For those of you who have multiple gates and complain about 1 control unlocking both gates you should know that if you replace the batteries at the same time and arm the first gate it sends out the signal to both gates and programs it to unlock both. So simply set up one gate while the batteries are out of the other, then set up the second gate seperately. I have never had them malfunction following these steps.

Cons: 
I also have had my toddler wedge a knee in the door. I found that this was due to the gate not being tight enough. It was very frustrating and a little scary but we were always able to help him out of the gate by sitting him down and pulling him straight back. We nearly got rid of this gate because of a few times dealing with this. But since we tightened up the pressure on the gate we have had no problems. It has also stripped some of the paint from my doorway where the tension feet are..right down to bare wood. I will have to repaint and patch when these gates come down. The also should be a little taller IMO, and if the gate is not tight enough it can become dislodged and open. Always check the gate when you close it to make sure it IS closed..a few rare occasions I have found it not completely closed. This usually happens when you manually open the gate then try to use the remote button to open it.

Overall, 4 stars. Would be 5 stars if the gate was taller and the bars a little closer to prevent pinching. Good price though and it is put together well"

The remote unit is on the wall in a place where everyone can reach it, except for the 13 month old of course.  It is so much easier for everyone.  

With all of the use our gate gets, the spot welds broke one day.  You really miss this gate when you have to go back to using a pressure gate again.  I called customer support, concerned because I do longer had my receipt or even the box.  The spot welds breaking loose was a problem they hadn't had reported before (so this apparently isn't a common problem!)  I was told we would receive a new gate within two weeks and the old one would be inspected by engineers to determine what had occured.  I was very impressed!
