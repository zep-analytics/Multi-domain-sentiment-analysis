Tina ""Ctina401""",Woonsocket,"I want to start by saying Fred Flare- shipped this product very fast!! And the transaction itself was very smooth. I do however, have extreme problems with the product itself. The product is not leather, its nylon, and it sort of looks cheap? The inside material is sued, but that's only the lining for the base of the wallet. Also, The wallet part is very hard to use. You cant really put too much in the wallet- The credit card slots are a little too snug, and there is no place for my I.D. The wallet included a small ""note book"" but it also doesn't fit in the wallet? I was very excited about this product, but now I feel duped. The pictures made the wallet seem like it was of higher quality, and that it was user friendly, but it's not. I do not recommend this product"

There are double stitches on the bag. the clip just above the calpack symbol, has come out. I suppose the ring which holds it has cracked. 

don't ask me, why I did not send it back... it costs 10 bucks which is one third the price of the bag, which does not make sense to send it back. It has started to give me the feeling that there is a price to pay for anything that is cheap! 

The next time, I'm going to branded bags, it is worth the price I guess.

On the other hand the rest of the bag seems to be ok! except for the defects on the front of the bag(mentioned above).

There is an internal flap used for credit cards, etc, that makes the wallet too thick - even if you don't fill it with cards.  I am tempted to cut it out (it is stitched to the inside) to make the wallet less cumbersome.

The credit card slots are also too tight - so you have to pry the cards in and out - and run the risk of cracking or splitting the cards.

There is a nice display for your license - with a small hole cut in it so that you can push the license out with your thumb when needed (it is also in a tight slot)"

Even when walking at a normal pace, the shoe kept sliding away from my heel when I stepped. Thirdly, the sole of the shoe is very narrow; it felt like walking in ice skates!

The company did a wonderful job of packaging/shipping the product-even the buttons were individually protected. I paid for expedited shipping, but they still cut the deadline close, so I was nervous about it arriving in time. The lining on the inside is thick and bulky so it isn't as streamlined as the pic implies, and tends to make the leather bulge a bit in places. (It was lumpy-looking even in the box.) Removing the zip-out lining doesn't change this--there's significant padding in the shoulders. It's also a shinier leather than expected. Sizing chart seems a bit inaccurate--I ordered a size larger than he normally wears in coats (which is a size larger than his regular clothing), but it was still too snug in places, lining or not. Overall, though, I'd say I got what I paid for, if you don't count the unusually high shipping charges. (Even standard shipping and handling charges were unusually high compared to other companies."

They all broke in the same exact place; the plastic pieces at the base of the legs all cracked.  Therefore, 3 out of 6 broke within probably less than 3-5 hours.

There are several segments (including ab work) where the ball is held with straight arms and moved from the down position to up over the head as well as twisting side-to-side. While doing these moves, I kept thinking that they really did not seem sound for that much weight. Sure enough by that evening I was dying! Perhaps they'd be ok if you used the lightest weight ball. I am in good shape and have actually been doing the P90X extreme workouts. I am accustomed to using 20-40 lb. weights and do Tae Kwon Do and I do not have any back problems. I snatched this up when I finally found it for a good price and did it on an off day. Just be forewarned-it is really easy to hurt your back with this workout.

In their defense: my money has now been refunded.

The inside is great and holds cards as a wallet should. The outside, well... ...the UNCOVERED metal clip does not press against the leather so you need about 10 folded bills to get the right thickness to close the gap between the inside of the clip and the leather - less than 10 bills and expect the bills to separate from the wallet - in your pocket (ok) but not good in the open. Maximum number of bills - about 20 folded. Occasionally press down the metal closer to the leather as it gets farther apart as it is used. The metal clip on the outside is not good to your trousers. If the clip is facing out - before too long the trouser will have a horrible looking mark from rubbing that part of your thigh against your hand or even worse, other objects. So I started facing the clip in, resting against my thigh - not very comfortable but not too harsh to leave a mark on your thigh. But `facing in' is very awkward when seated, like driving. Definitely not designed for back pockets. Why Buy: As a second wallet (one should have at least two wallets - to separate credit cards, IDs so all is not lost if one wallet is lost/stolen.

Walmart also has a real color explosion going on. You can get some really wild color combinations which give the shoe have a little personality for those occasions when you feel the need to express yourself.

DeLaRosby,,"Like the last reviewer said it's tricky to put on using the little straps that go around your bra...that is a FACT. A front closure bra might help some. Even though I (finally and after a lot of cussing) got the straps around my bra, the garment still gapped underneath the bra on both sides of the back strap, which is right in the middle. That is the only place in the back there is a strap to hold the whole back of the girdle up. 

Then there is one strap under each arm that goes around your bra there. It pulled down on my bra there causing scrunching. There is one strap in front in the middle too, which I don't need to use. 

The directions say to attach the Spanx/straps to the bra and 'step' into the garment. RIGHT!! Much easier said than done.

For it to stay up properly in the back I think it needs straps not only right in the middle, but also to the left and right of the middle, in between that and the under the arm ones. I can't really use mine...A waste of money, I already removed the tags and can't send it back. I have another Spanx that is the same but without the little straps and I can't use that either, as it does creep down in the back. Unless you don't MOVE that is. So altogether I have spent about $150 for Spanx stuff I can't use.

There must be a better way to fasten those straps....maybe sturdy SNAPS or velcro or something, and they should  fasten right to the TOP edge of the garment, as it is they hook half an inch down on the inside and that causes the top edge to tend to roll out and cause bulk there.

Not happy"

I bought this wallet only to hold a few credit cards, my ID and some cash.  Hence, there is a lot of wasted space in my wallet.  From the picture, it looks as though the business card side is just a slot. Whereas, in reality, it is actually a pouch (like most of the other card holders).  Other drawbacks are that there is some filler underneath the leather to make it look smoother (which takes up quite a bit of space), the leather itself is very low quality, and the wallet does not close well even without anything in it.  Furthermore, on the inside of the wallet there is a large white tag stating that it was Made in China.  I mean, China is great and all but if you're on a date and you say ""Hey, let me pay for this,"" and you pull out your credit card and a large white tag protrudes with it saying Made in China, well, you are pretty much a schmuck (I cut mine out with a pair of scissors, but there are still some remnants).  So if you like being low class, by all means, buy this wallet.  I personally don't care about my wallet very much so I am keeping it and going to use it, but I almost returned it.  It is most definitely a solid 2 stars.  Hope this helps"

The top fits better, since you adjust it. The cut is still quite poor and, again, there's no give to the silk so it feels tight across the shoulders. It's one thing for lingerie to be snug in the hips or bust. It's another when the cut is so bad that the shoulders are a problem.

If you're narrow through the hips, shoulders or bust, this combo will probably be a nice fit. If you're curvy, you might want to rethink this. It's a shame since it comes in plus sizes. Maybe I should have ordered up about two sizes but it should have been better made and a truer fit IMO"

Maybe I'm wrong, but I think most people who are looking for the latest fashion aren't going to suddenly start shopping at Lands End. And it seems to me that if a few customers are requesting a new style, the company should make a new, ADDITIONAL product in that style, rather than re-design a product which, according to Lands End's own descriptions, was a perennial customer favorite.

They've redesigned these COMPLETELY (and are doing this to all of their women's pants).  Don't be fooled into thinking you'll be getting what you used to order.  Also, this resizing / redesigning of women's pants is systemic.  LL Bean is discontinuing their similar Perfect Fit Pants and having all of their pants (knit or otherwise) resized / redesigned.  Here's just a few of their improvements?

Among the changes:  The waist band (height/width) has shrunk from 1.5 inches to 1.0 inches.  It now rolls!  Fun - not!
Next, the waist band circumference has been enlarged from 26 inches (=/- .5 inch) relaxed (when not being worn) to a whopping 28 to 29 inches!  

It was great fun to put on the ones I ordered, and even after washing them, I thought I must have changed bodies overnight.  The waist just hung.....  Dare I put anything in the pockets and they would have slid down.  When I tried walking in them, that's exactly what happened and I was constantly having to pull them back up.  I had to pin the waist to keep them on...

That's not all the changes.....

They've enlarged the bottom legs by FOUR (4) inches!  No more slightly tapered leg.

The front rise has SHRUNK from 12.5 to 11.5.  If I wanted my belly button to show, I'd go pull out a pair of my 70's hip huggers.....

The back rise has INCREASED from 15 to nearly 16 inches. Did my rear suddenly increase in size?  I think not.

They claim it is also a more substantial knit at 7.3 oz.(old was 6.7 oz).  The ones I am returning are LESS substantial - especially if you stretch them and can see through them which you can't with my old ones.

Next, it seems they have also extended the inseam length.  It was 32 inches on the old sport knit pants before washing - about 31.5 after.  The ones I received AFTER BEING WASHED had inseams measuring nearly 33 inches.

Finally, as if I wasn't feeling self conscious enough about my bod, the pants have been narrowed in the hips and thighs.

Do you get the picture?  The waist sags and rolls.  The seat is major baggy.  My belly button shows.  They have to stretch across my hips so there's those stupid horizontal lines where they pull at the crotch.  They are sucked tight to my thighs, then ballon out from my knees to the feet.  They're too long, so you can't even see my feet.

I spent 30 minutes on the phone with a ""specialist"" at Land's End and she couldn't explain why all the changes.  That's also where I got all of the above NEW specs.  Also, spoke with a specialist at LL Bean and their NEW specs are identical.

I spend so much each year with Land's End that I get a gift and card at Chrismas from them.  So, I'm not a casual purchaser of their product.

BUYER BEWARE AND GET THE NEW SPECS BEFORE YOU BUY A PRODUCT YOU THINK YOU KNOW AND CAN RELY ON. YOU CAN""T.

IF YOU ARE A LAND'S END or LL BEAN CUSTOMER - CALL THEM AND COMPLAIN.  THEY'VE DONE THIS IN THE PAST, THEN HAD TO BRING BACK THE ""OLD"" VERSION.

SO, IT WASN'T BROKE Land's End was always sold out or back ordered on their sport knit pants) SO WHOSE DIM-BULB IDEA WAS IT TO ""FIX"" THEM????"

Also, if you turned the car off it doesn't remember which station it was tuned to.

The footbed/sole is not cork like true Birks, but some sort of composite (rigid). Birk straps are softer and Birk corkbeds are more cushiony.

I wore them around the house to see if they were comfortable and the footbed became marked - just from an hour or so. Too bad because after that I knew I didn't like them. I tried on a pair of Birk Granada (the style this is based on) and immediately felt the difference. 

While these are about 30%-50% cheaper, I would have rather spent more on the original Birks. I think these won't hold up as long and don't offer the same comfort. Also, you can have real Birks ""repaired"" so they never really wear out.

*** UPdate *** November 15, 2006
It's been 2 months since I've been wearing these shoes, and I've changed my opinion them. Once you get use to the a3 sequence, they are actually quite comfortable. The honeycombs under the heels do make every step a little bouncier now. Maybe it takes time to soften up the material and make them more flexible"

It's impossible for any Bears fan to not love Walter Payton. With that love I ordered this jersey and it shipped to me from FansEdge. The shipping and billing was very speedy and with little delay I had the jersey delivered to my doorstep. It went downhill from there.

As soon as I opened the package I noticed that the 'GSH' (George S. Halas) initials had been sewn over and was broken. Very disappointing. I called FansEdge and they were great on the phone and sent me another jersey. While waiting for the replacement jersey I wore the defective one. By the time the replacement jersey came the iron-on stripes on the sleeves started to peel off. I figured it was just a defective jersey and opened the replacement one. It was exactly the same way. So either FansEdge received a batch of jerseys that were of poor quality or Reebok is maximizing their profit margins and overpricing a cheaply made jersey with one of the most incredible athletes ever name on it.

After asking and waiting 2 weeks for FansEdge to check their supply of jerseys to see if they were all like this with no reply...I cancelled my order. I am still waiting for a refund. This has been over a month now.

With the poor support of FansEdge and what appears like a poorly made jersey I cannot recommend anyone getting this. If you absolutely want one I recommend buying from a brick and mortar store.

Reoch,,"I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  

The idea of ""Medium"" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32"" waist.  Is that not ""Medium"" sized? 

I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  

The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  

Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.

I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like ""old men's"" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.

I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again. "

I mean, at almost $25 invested included shipping, I was expecting better quality. 

Well, it's very thin, made in China, and has plastic snaps. The so-called polyester lining just adds to the heat that's generated. I've owned many ponchos through the years, and the first thing you learn is that a poncho is a terrible design to keep out the elements for more than a short period. The reason involves the way it's cut. What I've learned is that you should buy something with some weight to the fabric so that the wind doesn't lift it up or out and allow the elements inside.

Next, you become hot and start sweating profusely in short time. So, a good lining, or a breathable system is required.

If you're just going to use it for short bursts in the rain, then you can get a cheap $10 nylon or plastic poncho almost anywhere. However, if you camp a lot, or will be out in the elements, you need better. The best poncho I ever owned had a rubberized outer layer and a thin cotton liner. This solves both of the problems I mentioned, because it had the weight to stay down and had the lining to help evaporate the sweat"

Russell,Pangaea,"This is a classic style work boot which used to be a lot more common than now, even appearing in one episode of ""Leave It To Beaver"" in the late '50s, and on the cover of one of Simon and Garfunkles albums of the late '60s. I've owned several pair of similar boots by other makers, including Red Wing. Some comments which apply to this style in general, (and not just Wolverines): Pros - The wedge sole absorbs a lot of shock making them great for standing/working on concrete, or walking long distances on hard surfaces. Also, the non-agressive tread means that dirt and grass doesn't track into the house after doing chores outside. The moc toe tends to breath through the seams, so feet tend to stay cooler and drier in hot, dry conditions. A great boot for the desert, and apparantly highly esteemed by many construction workers. 
Cons - The wedge sole doesn't offer much traction for serious hiking on steep, loose surfaces (which I've used them for, but for which they really weren't intended). Gravel will roll right out from under them. None of the several brands I have owned were water-resistant at all. Walking through wet grass will lead to wet socks very quickly, as the seams around the toe which allow air and perspiration to escape also allow outside moisture to enter just as easily. We used to say ""Your feet get wet two days BEFORE it rains"". So, perhaps not the best choice for hiking in the Pacific Northwest.
Specifically, the Wolverines were extemely comfortable right out of the box. They have a better insole than any of my previous boots of this style, a removeable polyurethane contoured cushion which provides good arch support. The color was actually more of a brown clay, rather than what I would call tan. The quality of workmanship appeared to be pretty good, actually better looking stitching than my Red Wings. However I was disappointed in the variable nature of the leather. The leather in most of the boot appeared to be adequately thick, however the leather used in the shaft around the ankles was thinner than I have ever seen in any work boot, thinner even than in many suede sneakers. While my ankles were covered, they didn't feel at all supported or protected.
After considering for a couple of days, I decided to return the boots to the merchant who provided them for Amazon, The Sportsmans Guide. They had provided a return shipping label in the box, so I taped the box closed, applied the label, and took it to the Post Office. I received an email a few days later acknowledging their receipt of the package, and a notice of a credit applied to my account.
So, while I'm not very excited about the particular pair of boots which I received, I do give good marks to Sportsmans Guide for a quick and relatively painless return. 
 I ended up purchasing the Georgia SPR 6"" Farm and Ranch boot, with wedge sole, also available through Amazon. For further details, please see my review"

We thought that washing them in Dove dish soap would wash away the slipperyness, but that didn't work. After handling the cover, your hands have a slippery residue on them.  The other issue is that the cover is so thin that it is little more than scratch protection, not impact protection.  The screen covers that come with the non-premium kit are ok, I guess, but one of them had 2 defect particles that were raised (trust me, the screen was clean).

It was bulky, rough and obviously inexpensively made. The tag said something along the lines of, ""Made in Hong Kong."

Firstly, the insole provided doesn't seem to fit the inside of the shoe properly. Almost like it's too wide. My foot is neither narrow nor wide, so this isn't something I typically notice about a shoe. There is an arch, but because of the weirdly shaped insole it doesn't provide any support. The zig zap strap is a really cute feature that I love, but it just adds to the uncomfort of the shoe. You can tighten the strap to keep your foot from sliding around inside, but then it cuts off circulation and leaves painful imprints. If you leave it too loose then you leave your feet pretty unstable.

Reoch,,"I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  

The idea of ""Medium"" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32"" waist.  Is that not ""Medium"" sized? 

I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  

The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  

Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.

I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like ""old men's"" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.

I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again. "

Once I received the boots I was upset to see that the boots were over 1 inch larger than the size chart showed - this is a big deal for a child's boot.  I then called Western Chief and explained the situation and asked to get an actual measurement of a few other sizes so I could order the correct boots.  I spoke with a Ms. Brewer, who was rather rude, she told me she would have to go to the warehouse to measure the boots and she would call me back.  Of course that was a week ago.  
I luckily found very similar boots at Target - problem solved.

My third pair, which was recently purchased, were not of the same quality of the prior pairs of boots. The leather was stiff and upon wearing them the first time the top lacing hook pulled out as I began to snug up the laces. The backer on the riveted lacing hook was defective from the factory.

The inner skin is a clear white-ish frosted color allowing the original ipod color to show through, I would have preferred an opaque white, but it did not look terribly bad with the green, though blue, red, or any other color than green would have been better with the black I had not the inital foresight to picture this. I was still pretty happy at this point. The hip-clip was removed right away, I have been looking for a nano cover that would allow me to dock to my Logitech MM50 (portable speaker)  without taking it out of the case, eureka, this case did that, without the clip of course.  The lanyard was an added bonus until earlier today I discovered the clips that held the lanyard in place had widened the aperature connections on the iPod nano, so that I would never trust it on the lanyard for fear it would fall off and be lost.  Well, I was still happy with the color change and the ability to sit in my portable speakers without taking it off. Unitl, I discovered a surface scratch on the green coloring of the case. Now, despite the fact that this is the ""Aluminum"" iSkin Duo, this was not the case at all.  The green metalic colored plastic is painted with an aluminum look.  Okay that was still acceptable, until, I discovered what looked to be a surface layer peeling off, sugesting that eventualy the color would flake away. That was it, that was the broke back camel inducement, and now I am the proud owner of a case that I will never be happy with. At first I had been all excited, and was considering the purchase of other colors, not now, this in my consideration was a waste of money. Hopefully I'll confirm that my ipod can still link to the cradle inspite of the clip damage the lanyard has done.

There is also no arch or foot support inside the boot itself. There is a piece of leather saying ""Made in China"" and that's it. The tag even reccomends getting some sort of insole. The worst part is that on the tag of the boot it states that you should get the next size up than what your normal boot size is. The seller did not state this fact.

I had this bag for about 2 months of daily use before the two serious failures appeared.
In two locations on the bag the nylon came unstitched: One hole along one of the side panels and the other under the handle. 
It would appear to me that the inside portion of the nylon wasn't properly sealed/Melted together to prevent the material from becoming unwoven. 
The handle came about half-way separated from it before I stopped using it. 

This is a really disappointing thing for me because in the age of globalization, quality always loses to low price and there seems to be fewer and fewer opportunities to buy really quality products without fear that it is crap with a high pricetag. 

I would advise Victorinox to pay attention to quality assurance before people abandon their products as overpriced junk products by a company who has sold out quality for price.

Reoch,,"I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  

The idea of ""Medium"" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32"" waist.  Is that not ""Medium"" sized? 

I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  

The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  

Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.

I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like ""old men's"" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.

I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again. "
