Daneker,"Spinnerstown, Pa USA","Some people scoff, they say $100 + for boots, no way, too expensive! I have been wearing DR's for 10 years, and nothing else. Why? Because nothing holds up like DR. Martins. 

Oddly my first pair ever fell apart after a couple of weeks, the stiching just fell out, but I exchanged them and have never had that problem since.

The average pair last me 2 - 3 years of everyday, non-stop wear. I where them all year around, on the sales floor, wharehouse or office, and everywhere I go. They will not come apart!

I only get new ones when the old ones look worn and stretched, and when the soles start to wear smooth (14 - 18 months of 8 - 14hr / day wear, seven days a week!) and then I keep the old pair for another 14 - 18 months for working outside or any dirty job I have to do where I don't want to damage my good pair.

I got married in DR. Martins, pollished with a new double-breasted suite! They look great with everything! Jeans, cargos, Dress clothes, shorts! I bought my wife a pair of dress sandles nearly three years ago, they still look like brand new!

These boots are forever"

Initially there was a problem with my order but Lu at 80s Purple was very helpful and once contact was made things were settled in a timely and orderly fashion.  I was very impressed with the customer service end as that is always important when dealing with a seller or vendor after the initial purchase has been made.  

The glasses are great.  Though thought of as some as ""80's"" ""Retro"" or what have you, Aviator sunglasses are like Chuck Taylor Converse shoes, like cowboy hats, like your favorite solid color T-shirt.  Its Americana, Classic, and Cool, which is what makes it buck the trend and stand the test of time.  I love my new shades.  They also come in a great hard-case so you can stow them anywhere and not worry about them getting damaged.  Beyond that even, why pay over 100 dollars for a pair of ""name brand"" sunglasses that are made of plastic when you can get something with sturdier, more durable metal frames?  Even beyond that, the UV rating on these is actually not any lower than anything else I've ever worn, solidifying the fact that not only are you getting what you pay for here, but if your not buying here and paying more elsewhere, you are most likely wasting your money.  I was very impressed with the professionalism and kindness showed to me by customer support.  Thanks 80s purple"

They come in a nice bag, and they're metal, not plastic frames. You wouldn't know from looking at them, since they're so thin and light. The lenses are full mirrored, and scratch pretty easily (I hugged someone while they were hanging from my shirt collar, and there are nicks). But they are wicked cool looking, block plenty of sun and unless you look really closely, you can't see my eyes, which is the point.

Indeed, last week I had a casual business meeting; with a little spit, elbow grease, and an old towel I used to dry off my dog, they cleaned up quite nicely and worked well with my Docker khaki's. 

They're exceptionally comfortable, timeless, and well worth the price.  How many 20yr old pair of shoes do you own?  That's like what, $5/yr?

The style colour conscience among you might want to consider another pair -- in black.  They're that good, like an old friend, reliable, stylish, and right there with you to conquer life's many challenges.

Yet, the Dr. Martens that works for me is UK 10/USA 11. Go figure. When the first pair of these I got began to look shabby, I simply polished it with brown shoe polish. That pair of shoes is still fine, after being worn more days than any shoes I have ever had"

You cant really put too much in the wallet- The credit card slots are a little too snug, and there is no place for my I.D. The wallet included a small ""note book"" but it also doesn't fit in the wallet? I was very excited about this product, but now I feel duped. The pictures made the wallet seem like it was of higher quality, and that it was user friendly, but it's not. I do not recommend this product"

I know they are a new globalized company, and I am not necessarily against that.

I am disappointed that you can't get a better range of colors. I've had a few blue pairs and a lovely green. But colors are not really available now except on high tops emblazoned with the brand name. An abomination for sure!

These shoes are very comfortable and apparently well-made. My single quibble with the black pair I got here on amazon has to do with the flimsiness of the tongue. I like a nice strong tongue. (And who doesn't?) Whatever they saved on material here may have been a mistake. On the other hand, maybe the sole will wear out first (or it will be a dead heat).

Never thought I'd buy shoes online, but amazon and the Doctor made it happen."

So I've gotten this particular shoe - 3 times!  I gotta still give it raves... but my hubby wants me to get a different style.  I won't get anything now but docs.  Why a different style?  Well - I just had a baby recently - and most of the leggings and stuff I wear - well - is black - and my docs have ALWAYS been brown.  You know - to go with a great pair of khaki's!

The average pair last me 2 - 3 years of everyday, non-stop wear. I where them all year around, on the sales floor, wharehouse or office, and everywhere I go. They will not come apart!

I only get new ones when the old ones look worn and stretched, and when the soles start to wear smooth (14 - 18 months of 8 - 14hr / day wear, seven days a week!) and then I keep the old pair for another 14 - 18 months for working outside or any dirty job I have to do where I don't want to damage my good pair.

I got married in DR. Martins, pollished with a new double-breasted suite! They look great with everything! Jeans, cargos, Dress clothes, shorts! I bought my wife a pair of dress sandles nearly three years ago, they still look like brand new!

After joining the military, traveling to nearly 50 different countries, in sleet, snow, and boiling deserts in the Middle East, this same pair of shoes still look great today, 20 years later, albeit scuffed up. 

Indeed, last week I had a casual business meeting; with a little spit, elbow grease, and an old towel I used to dry off my dog, they cleaned up quite nicely and worked well with my Docker khaki's. 

They're exceptionally comfortable, timeless, and well worth the price.  How many 20yr old pair of shoes do you own?  That's like what, $5/yr?

The style colour conscience among you might want to consider another pair -- in black.  They're that good, like an old friend, reliable, stylish, and right there with you to conquer life's many challenges.

I highly recommend them.

I don't know what I would do without my Spanx! I will never wear a pair of work slacks without them. 

A nice pair of trousers will have some polyester involved in it... well this stuff clings to bulges and panty lines. Spanx gets rid of VPL and smoothes out those little areas we don't like to mention. So fabrics that have a little more flow to them, will actually flow and not cling!

You will look more neat and tidy in your clothes and you might even look a few pounds lighter. They are so comfortable and because it is thin nylon material, you can wear them during the warm summer months.

Don't be fooled by imitations! Spanx brand is the only one you want when it comes to quality and doing what it promises!

I recommend the medium control even if you have a little bit of tummy to hide (it still works well on me). The super tends to be a little tighter so size up if you are going to get them"

I'm a bigger guy, and the compression gear tops don't work well with my big gut, these are just right for my lower body type. If you're a size 38-40 waist like me, go with the XXL, it's just the right size. Combined with the Under Armour Driver Mock (actually a golf item) my base layer is perfect, I never get cold. I recently wore the same combination skiing, and the leggings were perfect under my snow pants. Just pull them up to the top of the sock with a little overlap and no moisture accumulates against your body whatsoever, a very important element of staying warm and safe when it's cold out. All of Under Armour's products I have tried do a great job of this moisture transportation away from your skin and I'll never wear cotton or other long underwear again. Do yourself a favor and try these out, they are the new gold standard in my book"

Whenever the temperature drops to 40F or less, I wear these and my running shorts.  I can wear them to about 60F, then I overheat and have to shed them.  They are great except the fit;  they were too small in the quads, so I chose a XXL.  When the weather gets very cold (25F to 10F), I layer additional clothing on top, wind pants, jeans, whatever.

I am a frequent (normally 5+ times a week) endurance runner, and I have found these to be a great addition to my gym bag. Whenever it's too chilly to wear shorts, I'll pull on my Underarmour coldgear leggings and throw my shorts on top of them. Thay keep my legs nice and warm without overheating them.

I also tend to use these as a base layer under everything from jeans to my dress pants whenever it's cold out. Again, they keep my legs warm , but not too warm.

I also like the fit of these leggings. They are tight around the legs, providing good muscle support and compression (good for reducing injuries and soreness), without being too uncomfortable in the crotch and rear (provided you don't wear anything under them -- yes, they are supposed to be worn as underwear). They also have what feels like a synthetic microsuede interior, which just ads to the overall comfort level.          

I have heard a few people complain that underarmour heat gear keeps them a bit too cold, especially when they don't wear anything on top. I like to be slightly cooler when running, so these work for me. If you can't stand being a bit on the cool side, you probably shouldn't leave any part of the tights uncovered (wear something over that completely covers them), but if you don't, yo won't be shivering either"

for everyday lounging while wearing shorts/pants then they feel fine.

The width of 3 inches, is sufficient to completely cover my ears. It is only 3% Elastine, so there is a minimal stretch and it doesn't feel tight against my head, nor is it too loose to require constant adjusting. It sits comfortably, the polar fleece is what I would call a micro polar fleece - it has a small short pile and doesn't feel cheap. 

I have worn this headband in temperatures as low as 15 Degrees Fahrenheit and it keeps my ears warm. Unlike earmuffs I can wear the headband indoors, it's one less Winter accessory that I have to remove whenever I step inside a building"

They are extremely durable, and VERY comfortable.  They have so much padding and cushion, I like just wearing them around the house, and they feel like you have slippers on.  

The Thorlo XJ-11 Running Crew Socks were also very nice, well padded, etc., but were A LOT more expensive, and I actually prefer these Russell socks better.  The Thorlo's don't breath nearly as well.

I highly recommend these socks.  A good value, very durable, extremely comfortable, great cushion for runners, and breath great.

The only complaint I have about these pumps is that there isn't a lot of padding inside, so as the day went on my foot would rub back and forth in the front and cause some friction.  Other than that they are wonderful"

Other reviews have mentioned that these shoes don't look exactly like the picture, which is true - they are a little bit darker and have a fair amount of scuffing and marking done by the manufacturer out of the box, but I purchased these expecting them to be like that.

The material is light and does not cling to the thighs. The basic design has the seams running up the cheeks of the bottom not up the centre. This prevents the boxer from clinging to the centre of the behind. The boxers are durable and remain wearable for many years. Note that the front flap can stay open after continuous use and should be pressed to retain that `closed' look. Color selection is somewhat minimal. A 3-pack usually has 2 of one color when there should be 3 different colors/patterns. Why Buy: As your `main' line of boxers - practical for everyday use. You want to see your man looking sexy even after many washes

I really like that it displays the alarm clock time also - and shows whether or not the alarm function is on...even shows when it is on snooze ~ snooze is about 4-5 minutes, there is an indiglo light bar - which is the same as the snooze bar located across the top of the clock - very convenient and easy to find! The clock and alarm are very easy to set and you can go up or down so you don't have to scroll through the whole sequence to get back to your time...setting hour and minutes separately. All of the buttons beep when pressed - even the light/snooze button - but that is minimal compared to all of the great features and conveniences~ it is a quick beep and much less loud than others i have tried (for less beeping you can hold down the button for automatic scrolling when setting the time). I highly recommend this travel clock! Enjoy your travels"

To help clarify sizing for people (there have been conflicting reviews here), I ordered a Medium but then returned it for a L.  I will probably get some minor alterations, but I don't blame the company for that...everyone is shaped differently.

I am 6'0"" and weigh 175.  My suit measurements are a 42"" chest, 34"" sleeves, and 32"" pants inseam.  The Medium body fit but the sleeves and pants were too short.

Though this has been somewhat jokingly christened 'the bedtime slipper,' for looseness off the foot, the line on working feet is very visible, especially after repeated use.  Where Bloch and Capezio tend to require multiple fittings and testing of different styles- especially through mail order- Sansha styles, as long as they are purchased in the correct approximate widths and lengths, will mold to individual feet and stand for years with good care.  

The only reservation I have about these shoes is the leather soles' capacity for holding onto everything they pass over for an extended period of time.  If you dance in a meticulous studio, this is not an issue, but where a stray drop of soda or Gatorade is occassionally spilt, you may want to scuff the soles once a week.  Washing does not seem to clean the leather as well as the canvas, and eventual buildup will impede turns"

I think that you can not understand me. Still I am waiting my goods. I will check it after receiving my goods. I wait nearly one month and pay double price. I saw that prices are discounted. I am living in Turkey and when I purchase some goods from Cabelas, ll Bean or Sierra Trading Post, I receive max after 4 days. But in your systemI am still waiting becouse goods will go to NJ and my friend repack and transport to me. Today I contacted with him and thereis no news from my goods. He is working in fedex. I have no any bad things about Amazon or Bargain Outfitter, or Guide Gear companies. But I can not understand your system. I must purchase something from a/m companies and receive it max after 5 days.
Another sample last year (12.12.2006) I had purchased some shoes from JC Penney company and goods will came same way (to NJ and To TR) and I am still waiting. I wisited USA several times since 1960 and I can not beleive it.
This is last sample. I want to purchase some decoys from company ""Mack's Prairie Wings"" but they can not ship directly to Turkiye.

But this not end of every thing. I will purchase some goods from Amazon for timeless (i.e. necessary for next year) goods but When I need urgent I will prefere speed companies.

Thanks alot kind interest.

My other-half had selected the Black & Red version for me (the one pictured) -- which made it easily one of the most romantic of the bunch!

After a nice dinner out and once we got home -- I told my husband that I wanted to change into something more ""comfortable.""

When he came into the bedroom, I had slipped on these Jezebel crotchless panties along with my sexiest black negligee.  I was also sprawled across the bed - with the most alluring come-hither look I could muster.  (Hey, don't laugh!  It still works!)

I wasn't sure if lightning would strike again.  Buy hey!  With these Love Fifi's centerless panties -- I'm definitely three-for-three!


For some reason, I had assumed that these (and other) crotchless knickers would have little appeal between women.  

But when a close girlfriend came to visit one weekend - I soon learned otherwise!

I hopped under the sheets - with these Jezebels on, unbeknownst to her - to help warm her bed.

After getting reacquainted -- she playfully tried to slip her hand underneath - but I kept shooing it away!  

This went on for about ten minutes, until it finally dawned on her - that there was another way in!  

This was, incidentally, about ten minutes LONGER than my husband - or any guy, for that matter - would've taken to figure it out!

Surprisingly, I never would've guessed - that these Love Fifi crotchless undies would be so versatile!  Everyone loves `em!"

They only had the red. IMO, the red is a bright, clown red. It's not a bad red, it's just a true red with no subtlety. I almost considered getting them, but I reminded myself that I was on the hunt for a black patent, pointy toe skimmer. I am *so* glad Macy's did not have the black because I got them thru Amazon for $22.

I believe the shoe fits true to size. I am a 7.5M, period. In pointy shoes, I sometimes go for an 8 or avoid pointys altogether. I was going to listen to the reviews here and order an 8, but I tried on the 8 at Macy's and it was too big. I think it was a bit stretched it given that it was the floor model, but I figured even a brand new size 8 would be too big. 

I ordered & recvd a 7.5M. When I recvd the shoes today and put them on they were snug. Not snug in a tight or uncomfortable way. They just fit exactly to my foot. This is a leather upper and not man made. So the patent looks black and shiny! It's not cheap looking at all. The point comes to a nice triangle and isn't exagerrated. Given that they are leather, I expect them to stretch a little to my feet. 

The shoes measures 10.5"" from the point to the middle of the heel. The point to the top of the shoe is 3"" and there is 1"" between my big toe and the point. There is comfortable room to move the toes and because the shoe is leather, it will form a bit to the feet as you wear them. I have experienced that already just walking around the house. The shoe looks low cut on the sides, but my foot stays completely in the shoe when I am walking. I'll be watching to see if I end up with a line/bend across the front of the shoe. By the time that happens -- if it ever does -- I will certainly have gotten my $22 out of them. 

And finally, I am 5'2"" and I tend to avoid pointy toe shoes because it sometimes looks like I am wearing skis. These shoes are great because they elongate my leg and don't create a costume-y look. They look great peeking out of the jeans I have on and I expect them to look good w/the new capri leggings I got the other day. 

Highly recommended!"

It feels like someone is  standing in back of you suspending  the weight off your shoulders.  The pack sits high on you shoulders- stays there (no slipping or sliding) and keeps the weight off your lower back.
 
It's compact, slim, low profile, and yet plenty roomy enough to carry a few extra books.  It's got two roomy main compartments,  and a lot bigger than it looks gadget pouch area.
 
My main complaint is with the gadget pouch- it's not all that convenient to reach in and grab a pen or whatever, because the zipper scrunches up when you try to open the compartment.

These undershirts are made of extremely soft cotton that is just slightly thinner than your average undershirt from Hanes or the likes. The cotton is amazing - these shirts seem to last forever, and after about three washes they feel like they were made to a mold of your body. I don't know what is different about them, but unlike cheaper tee's, they come to fit you perfectly rather than just hanging flat down your sides like so many other undershirts.

If you haven't worn these before, you don't know what you're missing out on. The comfortable fit means your underarms don't sweat at all because the material fits you perfectly rather than gaping open under your arms. I really can't describe what a difference these shirts make to my day-to-day comfort.

The only complaint I have is that they are slightly hard to come by -- so once you're hooked you'll always want to have a few extras on hand. Highly recommended"

That's why I love these shoes.  They are comfortable right out of the box, and I can only imagine they will continue to become even more comfortable as they mold themselves to my feet.

The hand-antiqued leather offers a nice texture that works equally well with dress pants/khakis or your favorite pair of jeans.  They slip on easily, with no need for a shoe horn, and they stay on securely, without coming loose at the heel, as some loafers are prone to do.  

This is my first pair of Clarks and I'm very impressed so far with the high quality of the leather, the comfort, and the look.  

All in all, these shoes are great.  I highly recommend them if you're looking for a versatile and comfortable loafer.     "

My favorite thing about them is the way they slim my hips. I wear a size 12 (sometimes a 14) and ordered a Large the first time. They fit perfectly, though I had to pin the part around the ankle to keep it from being so blousy. I noticed that complaint on other reviews, but it's easy to pin it from the inside and remove some of the fullness. The slimness in the hips and the comfortable fabric completely make up for the ultra-fullness at the ankle. I get compliments on them everywhere I wear them and I can dress them up or down, with flats or heels, with no problem. I did make a mistake when I ordered the second pair and got an XL. I washed them on hot and dried them very hot, as well. They actually fit fine and are really comfortable--but I'll order the Large again next time, for sure. I'm going to order all the other colors available, and maybe even a second pair in the olive green since I wear them so much. They'll never go out of style. They're perfect for airline travel because you can put your boarding pass and I.D. in the pockets, while sending your carry-on or purse through the conveyor-belt security. I love these pants!"

These knicker-length pants(4 or 5 inches below your knee, depending on your height) are made of an 88% organic cotton, 12% Spandex blend. The material is just the right thickness for a sweaty practice (like Baptiste Power Yoga)-- fairly thin, but not skimpy feeling, wicks well enough, holds some moisture, but doesn't get or feel drenched during your practice.  Verve is a small Colorado company that makes clothes for climbers.  That background shows in these pants -- the fit is just right, not tight (like a pair of long johns), but roomy (and stretchy) enough to allow easy movement between poses. Verve makes a longer Hanuman pant, that I have not tried.  I really like the knickers because they let you see correct positioning of your feet and don't have surplus fabric that might get in your way -- really good for Tree pose, for example"

Only buy ISOTONER now and don't share them with closet monsters. These slippers follow me around the house. I have even driven in them. I am wearing a pair right now. I make room for them in my bags when I travel -- never leave home without them. Arch support makes all the difference!

The women's large is comparable to European size 39.

When machine washed and machine dried, they come out looking like new. They do wear out eventually or get misplaced around the house so buy two pairs.

Amusing aside: Until his feet grew too large, my teenage son used to steal my slippers (navy blue ISOTONER terry). Had to beg him to give them back. Now his feet are too large and the men's slippers I have bought him, he says, are not as comfortable, alas"

I'm glad they still make them; I'm going to get a pair in a different color. The design looks even better: the sole appears to be more plush, and the satin edging is a nice touch.

The slippers are easy to slip on, but not easy to slip in! (good traction), and they wash up great in the washing machine everytime.

BUT the most important thing is that these slippers help reduce the pain in my feet. There are the only slippers I've had with arch support and they conform and stay on even though they are ""clogs"". I have problems with my feet. I've been wearing Birkenstocks lately, and even with these, my feet hurt after a few hours, and I can't wait to put on my ""Pillowsteps"" at the end of the day.

Do treat your leotard somewhat gently so that you don't get a snag in it from a ring or rough handling.  I wash it in a fabric bag and let it air dry.

B000281OSW:these_are_the_best_jeans_money_can_buy:steven_m._balke_jr.,B000281OSW,Wrangler Classic Fit JeanÂ Â : Apparel,apparel,9 of 9,5.0,These are the best jeans money can buy,"October 14, 2004",Steven M. Balke Jr.,"Ypsilanti, MI USA","If you are like most people these days, we practically live in our jeans.  What we really want is a pair that 1) Feels good, 2) Looks good, 3) Lasts long, and 4) Isn't too expensive.  Finding all four of these traits in one pair of pants can be tricky, but it can be done.

Wrangler has designed the perfect pair of jeans!  They offer a variety of cuts, sizes, and styles so that it is easy to find a pair that fits perfectly (which, incidentally, jeans that fit look much better than jeans that don't) even if you are going for the ""baggy, pants hanging at the knees"" look.  Regular, relaxed, angler or carpenter, all of the cuts and style feel great.  Also, they are really inexpensive and readily available at Amazon.com, Wal-Mart, or any nearby equivalent.

I am really hard on my jeans.  I am constantly wearing holes in them, ripping them, setting them on fire, etc.  I have found no jeans that last as long as Wranglers do.  I have tried other department store brands like Levi, Old Navy or Dickies, which wear out quickly (some even disintegrate washing them!) and I have tried more upscale, even designer brand jeans like Evisu, True Religion or Dolce & Gabbana which don't hold up to the wear and tear of everyday life.  Wranglers have outlasted them all, and on top of that, they are still cheap enough to replace easily if something catastrophic does happen.

One word of warning that really applies to all brands of jeans, however, is that the more bleached or stonewashed the jeans you buy are, the faster they are going to wear out.  If you are really looking for value, the dark dark blue jeans are the ones that will last the longest, and you may get, depending on how much you wear them, another six months to a year out of them.  The stonewashed is the ""in"" look, however, and they are still really good jeans even if they don't last as long.

There may be other jeans out there in the world that are as good as Wranglers, but I've honestly stopped looking now that I've found these.  They do the job and I am happy to wear them 308 days a year"

The Ogio Locker Bag is brilliant and the inventor should get some sort of award. K.R.T. Seeley's review sums it up pretty well, but here are a few things to add. For one thing, the shoe area also nicely accommodates a hair dryer or curling iron. One of the reasons this matters is that it points up a critical advantage of the shelf separating the shoe area from the upper part of the bag: while the shelf is sturdy, it's also adjustable. It goes only low enough to allow for a pair of shoes, but it can also be raised to allow for other items. 

Next, while it's very nice that the front end panel has all these handy little pockets for things like shampoo, brush, and whatnot, actually including containers that fit the pockets shows a real consideration for their users. Another plus is the number of outside pockets, several of which are not only zippered but waterproof as well, for, say, wet bathing suits. 

Before I bought this bag, I called my gym and yes, I really did make them go measure the width of their lockers. The magic number was 12"". At 8"", the Ogio bag fits in with room to spare. 

For raqueteers (sports, not crime), there are several loops on one of the end panels for holding racquets and a couple of others I haven't quite figured out yet. 

For yogis and yoginis, yes, the adjustable strap on the end panel can accommodate a yoga mat, if it's not too thick. 

An outer side pocket nicely accomodates my workout journal (yes, I'm a fanatical record keeper), as well as my beloved NewGrips (just do a search on NewGrip) which are indispensable for rowing (notoriously hard on the hands) and weight-lifting (and about a billion other things for those of us with carpal tunnel, arthritis, or, in my case, both). Another outside pocket is perfect for a CD player and headphones. 

The only improvement I can imagine for this bag would be adjustable straps on the bottom to hold larger, rolled towels or mats. Unfortunately, even Title9 doesn't seem to carry that one anymore. 

In other words, this bag is the best on the market. It's a bit pricey but it's worth absolutely every cent. I suspect that quite a lot of my friends will be getting the Ogio for Christmas and birthdays and whatnot. Congrats, Ogio, and thank you very, very much"

Tucker Seeley,"Boston, MA United States","This bag is simply amazing!  I go to the gym 4 times per week and often go directly from work so I needed a bag that would hold everything I needed to workout and clean-up afterwards.  The Ogio Locker Bag does it all:  it's got a special compartment for my gym shoes and a shelf to separate them from my towel and workout gear.  It fits perfectly in just about any gym's locker (I go to Bally's) and with its front-opening door, you can access everything you need while your bag is IN the locker! I love the fact that it comes with containers for my toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, soap) and also with a comb, brush, and mirror. To top it off, it's light-weight, sturdy, and even comes with a built-in vent so that your wet/sweaty clothes don't get too ripe! LOL! : )  I couldn't be happier with my purchase!  GET THIS BAG!!

1.  The ear muffs are of a very LOW Quality.  Hardly worth the $14.99 GemAvenue (e4hats) charged me for it.
      $0.99 would have been a fair deal.

2.  The ear muffs were advertised as being new but it had a definite ""second hand"" feel to it.  It reminded me 
      of opened merchandise from the Salvation Army Store!!!  No Joke.  In fact there were no tags on it at all to 
      inform me of where it was made, what it was made of, washing instructions, etc.  it did not even have the 
      name of the manufacturer!!!!

3.  The plastic band felt very fragile like it would break with the slightest pressure.  Adjusting the width was 
      nerve-racking because I had to be very careful not to break it!

4.  The ""wool""(?) had a very SYNTHETIC feel to it.  Furthermore it was sparse and flat.... NOT warm and fuzzy.  I  
      doubt very much it is sheepskin as claimed by GemAvenue.  Besides, there was no tag to indicate that
      it wasnt in fact some sort of CHEAP polyester.

5.  I tried it on and it did NOT cover my ears completely, so you can be sure its NOT going to keep my ears  
     warm at all.

IN CONCLUSION,  this product is NOT NEW, NOT SOFT, NOT WARM, NOT GENUINE SHEEPSKIN!!!

What more can I say?  I am just disgusted at Gem Avenue (e4hats) for selling me this rip off useless piece of JUNK!!!  I will NEVER buy anything from Gem Avenue (e4hats) EVER again!!"

B000FA0T7Y:lightweight_running_shoe:the_amazon_shopper,B000FA0T7Y,adidas Men's a3 Microride Running Shoe: Apparel,apparel,2 of 2,4.0,Lightweight running shoe,"November 11, 2006",The Amazon Shopper,,"Adidas has three types of shoes for their ""Ride"" shock absorption running shoes; the Gigaride, Megaride, and this - the Microride. Microride outsole consists of smaller sized absorption grooves (aka Nike Shox lookalike). Gigarides and Megarides emphasize shock absorption. Microride is more concerned with weight, it seems like.

There are also two models of Microride, one with full fabric top, another with synthetic leather construction. This one is the full fabric, which is supposed to be soft, and also lighter. (The synthetic leather is supposed to be more durable.)

Anyway, with the combination of Microride and full mesh top, this shoe is low and very light. I can't find a number anywhere, but once started running, the shoes feel like featherweight. The impact is a little bit harder, due to less shock absorption, so it's probably more of a treadmill shoe than trails. Overall, though, very comfortable. It's my first time with running shoes this light and I like it. With these, I achieved my fastest pace ever with less effort than I would have expected.

A couple of things I did notice: the size is on the narrow/small side (compared to my Nikes), and the back heel support is a bit hard/tall for my liking. The white version gets dirty quickly. Running was good, but walking on wet road experienced slight slippage. Also, the workmanship leaves a bit to be desired"

After they are washed and you wear them, they are pretty tight for the first 10 minutes, but after that they are just so loose on the legs. You start to loose some of the support your looking for. I would suggest to get a size smaller than what you really are. I'm a waist size 29 and I should be wearing an XL but they are too loose so I wear the L. Try it out and see if you like them.

P.S. If you use nail polish to repair a run in these pantyhose, I recommend ""I'm Not Really A Waitress,"" even though it's red, and will look like a glossy little drop of blood on your leg.  If someone does happen to notice, you can make a little joke about it (a good ice-breaker)"

So, consider how your shoes fit before getting these.  If they are snug, these sock will just make them snugger.  Finally, I like the color selection on these socks.

I love the name Denim Heather, and I am really excited about wearing these to work on Monday morning.

Recently I purchased an 8 pack of these briefs for excercising and because I thought I ought to give briefs another try after 6 years. At first, it was a bit strange, but I quickly came to enjoy the feel of this style of underwear. They don't bunch up or give you ""wedgies"" like boxers do because of their looseness and center-seam design. They provide support for your male stuff and stay in place throughout the day. People tend to believe that briefs are ""too tight,"" hence the term tighty whiteys. If they're too tight, you bought them too small. Simple as that. These briefs are perfect for wearing any time in any situation. I thought I might feel self conscious while wearing them, but the comfort of them overshadows any of that. If anything, I'm proud.

Overall, I recommend you give these briefs a shot, no matter what underwear you tend to prefer. However, despite being pre-shrunk they do shrink up a bit after the initial wash. I'm a 32 in boxers, but 34 in these works out great"

The Outrunner took me by surprise, It offers a nice narrow heel, snug midfoot with a medium to high arch height with the traditional adidas 3 stripes for an adaptable snug midfoot fit, narrow to medium forefront with a narrow to medium width, medium to high depth toe box. The low profile sole is not cushy at all and is perfectly supportive yet nicely flexible with a very smooth heel-to-toe transition. The shoe feels very light on the foot; I would have guessed around 10 oz. As it feels so light, yet after putting the shoe on the scales it weighed in at 13.5 oz. In my (men's) size 12. 

The a3 Outrunner was an excellent addition to my shoe lineup and was an excellent bargain from Amazon.com considering their low sale price combined with the [...]and the [...].

I would buy this model again without even batting an eyelash. The a3 Outrunner offers a great fit! I always size up by a Â½ with Adidas running shoes over all of my other running shoes and the fit is right on.

It is not a quest of time and space, but of clothing.

I have been seeking a truly wrinkle-free dress shirt for women.

Oh, I've tried men's dress shirts, but they look so, well, masculine. I've tried women's stretch shirts (with spandex!) but they wrinkle into a little ball, just perfect for that pitch into the trash can.

I've bought wrinkle-free shirts from Chadwick's, Lands End, Villager and others and was disappointed.  They weren't bad, but they weren't good.  If I washed them with my husband's shirts, there was just no comparison.  There were always wrinkles in my shirt.  Sometimes not wrinkled enough to have to iron them, but never really neat looking.

My friends, my quest is over.  I have found the women's dress shirt that wears and washes like a man's.  This  Women's Wrinkle Free Dress Blouse by the Foxcroft Shirt Co. has met my high standards.  I stays neat all day (even after a brisk walk in warm, humid weather) and washes beautifully.

I washed it with my husband's shirts and some wrinkle free shirts from other companies.  It looked as good, if not better, than my husband's permanent press shirts and it left my other shirts in the dirt (or wrinkles, as the case may be).

The price tag is more than I usually spend, but considering the time that I will not have to spend ironing, it's worth it. I plan to buy it in each color."

The only two downsides are that it's a little too tall for standard depth pants pockets. This just means that I have to be a little more watchful that it doesn't fall out or get stolen ... but keeping an eye on my wallet is always a smart idea! The only other problem is that dollar bills are not easily moved into our out from the side pockets. It's as if the pocket is the exact same length as the dollar bills themselves, which makes quickly stowing and retrieving money a little cumbersome.

Giles ""Fitness Junkie""",Rural Georgia,"OK, I admit it. I was a bit skeptical about ordering this shirt because it looked kind of tacky in the photos. But since it was on a Friday sale, I ordered the Asian Pear color, which is really a light beige or tan (I thought it might be kind of greenish, but no). 

I'm 5'8"", 135 lbs, with broad shoulders and long arms. I ordered a medium. And I'm wearing it right now. The sleeves are plenty long enough, and there is a generous amount of 'give' in the shoulders. I'd say that this shirt almost runs true to size, although a medium certainly doesn't hug me like the medium-sized Brandon Thomas grommet jacket does. A large size in this shirt would have been far too big for me. I probably could have gotten away with a small, but I like this shirt being bit loose. I can wear a shirt underneath it without it being too snug.

The quality of the shirt (which could really be used as a light jacket) is quite good. It isn't lined, but it is soft to the touch and warm. It snaps closed, so no loose buttons to worry with. 

I like it! It isn't tacky-looking in person, but it's definitely different. If it goes on sale again, I will buy another color"

They are 100% combed cotton, feel soft and nice, and even the elastic waist band is cotton covered for extra added comfort.
The 3-pack of black assorted I received contains 1 solid black pair and 2 pair that are a light green with a very pretty darker design of little flowers and box shapes.They still fit great even after laundering(the instructions say dry on medium but I used low).The price seemed just a little high but they are an excellent quality and have lasted through countless washings.

This style may also be found at ""Bare Necessities""  The prices at this time are exactly the same at the 3 sites. What I usually do is check for what the deals are on the shipping charges(this will depend on how much you are spending with each merchant in total) and also, you may find a different variety of colors or patterns at each. Just type in Jockey Elance 3 pack Bikini. This one is style 1449(check editorial description on product page to make sure), and just judging from the reviews of the other styles, these are the best in quality and comfort.

(Silk has great moisture-wicking and quick-drying properties.) Under nylon shorts, the Intimo silks managed to keep my Special Fun Area reasonably dry even while hiking in driving rain. When they did get wet, they dried much, much faster than cotton boxers do. 

They lasted a couple of months before falling apart - a pretty good show of durability, actually, given the amount of punishment they took. I had only two pair and I alternated them, often with a full week between washings. Obviously they got kinda crusty, but that couldn't be helped. Under the circumstances they held up well. I would recommend them.

As for this boxer/brief/thong controversy, I believe a man should wear whatever type of underwear he finds most comfortable. If that means boxers, fine. If it means a thong, fine. What women consider stylish should be at the very bottom of a man's list of concerns. Women consider all kinds of ridiculous things stylish, such as hairless pets, square-toed shoes, pointy-toed shoes, the Monochromatic Look and the music of Andrea Bocelli"

The way in which the bra opens and closes makes it very easy and comfortable, and it doesn't create strange lines under your clothes like some nursing bras do.  After the first few weeks of wearing this bra, I had no doubt that I had made the right purchase.  
   On the downside, as others have mentioned in their reviews, I did notice that as time went on the bra seemed somewhat less supportive.  Along the same lines, this bra bothered me to wear to bed, because my breasts always seem to fall out of it.  I know I was wearing the correct size, so maybe this was due to the low-cut criss cross shape of the bra.  Whatever the reason, I found it quite irritating and uncomfortable to wrestle with my breasts in the middle of the night!!  To be fair, I had the same problem with another(different brand)nursing bra also, so maybe this is just what happens when you try to sleep in bras.  Consequently, I ended up buying a sports type bra for sleeping.    
  Overall, because I only used this bra for daytime wear and I resigned myself to the fact that I'd have to wear breast pads with almost any nursing bra, I really liked the Bravado bra and would definitely recommend it.         "

I have a a cheap plastic one and a weighted rope (this everlast leather weighted).  The plastic one costs only a few dollars that I use if i'm traveling for more than a couple days, and sometimes to mix it up.  The weighted rope is a good cardio workout which also tones your upper arm extremely well.

This is my 4th pair because the others have eventually cracked through, which happens when it drops repeatedly against the floor at a bad angle.  One of them also just wore out in the center where there's alot of friction with the floor.  I tried another plastic handled brand, but that cracked around the same area as well, and even sooner.

This is a classic, and fully recommend.  it didn't receive 5 stars only because it needs to be replaced every couple years.  but then again so do all the others.  Highly recommended"

One of the metal ribs actually bent and broke in half, so it's pretty much a lost cause.

That said, this is an excellent umbrella. The auto-close feature is so handy if you're going to be in and out of the rain a lot, like going shopping on a rainy day. While everyone else is standing at the door, pulling their umbrellas shut, you just pop it down and go inside. I never had a problem with the open/close mechanism. The colors that this umbrella comes in are also so cheerful - mine was the bright green color.

The small size of this umbrella makes it easy to tuck into your purse (or man-bag) if you're not sure about the weather. It is a little heavy for such a small size, but not overwhelmingly so.

If the rib of this umbrella hadn't broken so suddenly, I would have given this product 5 stars. However, if you can resist using it during a nor'easter, give it a try - it's an excellent product"

Being a 3-in-1 jacket has several uses. First off, the jacket worn with both the fleece inner lining and the outer shell is very warm for use outside on frigid winter days and the shell semeed to be waterproof or water resistant because even after rolling around in the snow it wasn't drenched. The outer shell by itself provides some warmth and also the water resistant outside to put over something else, say for example the suit jacket I wore to work. Definately not for winter use by itself but a nice compliment to something else. The fleece on its own is what I liked. Very warm and comfortable and stylish looks, I would constantly wear it around town by itself on a cool fall evening when out with friends. Only downside, it seems to be a magnet for pet hair.

One thing to note, this adapter is not a voltage converter; it will not convert European 220V to US 110V, unlike what one reviewer said.
Shouldn't be a problem at if your power supplies support a range of 100-240V like most mobile devices these days: laptops, mobile phones, PDAs, etc. Just read what's on the power supply or device you're taking to Europe."

The bag is made of sturdy fabric and the wheels roll smoothly. The telescoping handle pops up and collapses quickly & effortlessly. The bag also comes with a detachable shoulder strap which I removed because (1) my bag is always too heavy to carry on my shoulder and (2) when rolling, the shoulder strap often dragged on the airport floor which caused it to get dusty & dirty. Fortunately, this bag has two short handles which make it easy to lift when going up stairs or moving it to an overhead bin.

It seems like as soon as he gets in he's in his own little cozy womb-like world and he just drifts off... It can be hard on the back in the shoulder blade area, as well as on the shoulder if used for a long stretch of time, but keeping the two layers as spread out (vs. bunched up) as possible generally remedies the problem.  It's easiest (I think) to put the baby in if you guide their head in first, and it's also easy to switch shoulders or the hand baby in sling to another person.  This is our most used piece of baby gear by far - my husband even gardens with it on!  Our son has loved it since he was 4 days old - he's 2 mos now and 15 lbs and there's still plenty of room for him in it.

**I feel that maybe a 6 would give me a firm size (one where theres somewhat no squirming ability), so thats why i decided to stick with a 7. I hope that this ""size review"" helps out a bit with your choice of size.**

If youre ordering these sandals be prepared to take one size down or two or else you'll feel foolish with such big sandals.

Besides that, the shape and form of the sandal is quite nice. Its quite comfortable, because after all it is a licensed birkenstock. Plus the price is right compared to the other birkenstocks. Thats why its moved up to 4 stars"

I am a lady and a rather attractive one at that and I can assure you that a gentleman with such distinguishing taste as to wear He-Man boxers would get more than a passing glance. With the literal, but adorably suggestive ""I Have the Power"" on them, they achieve nostalgic innocense and at the same time a sexiness that can only be achieved by a deep appreciation for all things 80s. How could you possibly look cuter unless you were to actually wear purple furry little underwear over your tights like Adam loved to sport?

When my wife became pregnant, she was worried that she would have to constantly expand her wardrobe as our wonderful growing child expanded her belly (yeah, I know babies grow in uteruses, but ""belly"" just sounds so much cozier).  These Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands allowed her to wear her normal pants and skirts with the waists undone all the way up to her sixth month.

After our child was born, my wife had no more use for the bands, but I didn't want to see them go to waste.  I have always been pretty trim, but I wondered if the Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands might work for a growing beer belly as well as a growing baby belly, so I began to eat and drink excessively, allowing my belly to grow.  My wife thought I was being idiotic, but I told her that she had had her turn, so she should let me have mine.

After gaining fifteen pounds and a noticeable paunch, the waists of my pants no longer buttoned comfortably.  I undid my pants, wrapped my belly in one of the Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands, and threw on an old oxford shirt.  After buttoning just the top few buttons of the oxford, I looked as if I were wearing a particularly snug, extra-long, patterned t-shirt underneath.  I went to my local watering hole and none of the guys recognized that I was wearing an article of my wife's clothing!

I have now become a big fan of Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands, and have bought additional bands to add to my wife's collection.  Well, I suppose I should say ""my"" collection since I'm the one wearing them.  If my wife becomes pregnant again, I will, of course, share the bands with her.  Who would have thought that my wife's pregnancy and my frugality would result in the sharing of clothing between me and my beloved?  I joke to her that my ""child"" is due any day now, and then rub my belly lovingly.  My wife gives me a strange look, sighs, and then just shakes her head.  I know she's just jealous, so I tell her, ""Hey, all you have to do is become pregnant again if you want to wear these Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands.""  ""I don't know if your fathering another child is such a good idea,"" she replies.  I ask her what she means, but she just shakes her head and says, ""Never mind."

These pretty French Knickers were the first of the bunch I tried -- and I absolutely loved `em!

Over the years my hubby has always given me different kinds of lingerie, all of them mainly ethereal or low-cut, but nothing scandalous.  And I think we were both ready for a change.

I immediately fell in love with the high-on-the-hips and almost bottomless look of these knickers - and how they made my legs look even longer!  The fabric was much sheerer than what I was expecting, but the visual effect was pretty close to what's seen in the photo. 

These were the first crotchless panties I'd ever tried.  And it felt different to expose so much of my cheeks in the back (as compared to other boy-cut shorts I had worn).   But it was definitely the feeling of openness in the front - that made me feel the sexiest!  

I wore these to bed one evening along with a matching-color camisole on top.  And even though these knickers made me more accessible (which was wonderful during our warm up), I still removed them (out of habit) when things got more passionate!

For more general usage, I could easily see myself wearing these under my dress or skirt - when dining out with my husband (as a tease).  But I'd probably want to consider getting a more thorough waxing first!   

To finish up, I guess I had always thought of crotchless panties as being a little tasteless.  But these cute French Knickers - and the other items I received from Love Fifi - were as beautiful as they made me feel!  "

It's very soft and buttery, lightweight, and long.  The drape is incredible.  You can wear it just around your neck or drape it over your head first and it looks stunning.

Initially, I got the winter lilac color, which is actually magenta.  Very pretty color.  I loved it so much, I bought the ivory, black, and cassis (a dark burgundy).  This was a good thing, because my six-year-old daughter cabbaged onto the first one.  Imagine that: A scarf a child actually *wants* to wear.  I love this scarf so much, I'm going to buy the other colors I don't have yet.

We had a very cold, windy winter this year, and I wore one of these scarves every day.  They kept me warm without being oppressively heavy.  They also roll up into almost no space at all, so they're ideal for travel or having in your bag ""just in case.""

The scarf is 100% acrylic, and the one drawback is that it's dry-clean only.  I suspect handwashing would be okay, though.  Even if you have to baby it a bit, it's worth it for the exquisite texture.

I highly recommend this scarf.   "

Thiel ""John T.""","Astoria, Queens, New York City","This is my necktie.  There are many like it but this one is mine.  If my necktie is wrinkled, I am wrinkled.  Without my necktie, I am merely smart casual.  [. . .]

It's amazing that I've been a male all my life (hey, this is the 21st century), worn many a necktie, but outside of those electronic tie organizers with the lights and motors they sell in Sharper Image I have never even known what sort of way one might store their neckties except in a heap--which has been my method all the while.

So now that I'm a business-MAN, I wear these strange things every day, and I have many, so the heap has gotten quite a lot larger than it used to be.  And now I'm doomed to neatness because I'm getting hitched--so I get to wear ties more often, but 'the pants' less.

And there in the soft center of my American male mind--the wife being Japanese--I've got this idea: Why not put my neckties on a tie rack?!  Brilliant!!  It will be a pre-emptive strike in the neatness department--major husband points.

But I don't want that dammed Sharper Image thing.  It's great as a gift but to tell the truth, it takes up more than its share of closet space and wouldn't be very becoming outside of the closet. 

This thing though, very nice.  Cedar, brass, hangs on the inside of the door.  It's exactly what I was imagining, and fortunately some other brilliant man out there thought of it too.

I take one point away for all the tie racks out there though, because there surely could be something just as classic and simple, but better functioning.  Guess I'll have to work on that one.  For instance, this could have one hinged retaining piece of wood so the ties don't all come flying off the rack when you open the closet door too fast"

I returned the shoes, and I was disappointd by two things:

1) I had to pay shipping (almost $10) to send the shoes back.
2) My shoes cost me $30 (NOT including shipping them to me), but the company was only willing to refund $20.

So, in reality, it was a huge waste of money.  I paid $45-50 for the shoes, including shipping both ways, and they only refunded me $20.  So I lost $25-30 on these shoes.  What a waste.

Aesthetics - These are definately the dream come true.  The form of the boxer brief is perfect for those times when you get caught, or wanna get caught, with your pants down.

Support - These are perfection in motion.  Under Armour caters to the athletic gentleman, and so these are a nice combination of light fabric that really holds the boys in place.

Comfort - Get the right size for you, and they won't pinch, ride up or move around.  Since they're Under Armour, they're made to breathe and keep your body, at least those parts covered, at an ideal temperature.  This is true even if you're working out with them on, though you ought to change when you're done!

I read once in a medical publication that physicians warn against g-strings and thongs that wedge themselves in you-know-where because the fabric acts as a wick for bacteria to migrate forward.  (Try not to vomit.)  Well, I'm one of those people who can't get a picture like that out of her mind once it, er, wedges itself in there, so I was about as anti-thong as a person could be.  But sometimes you can't (or don't dare) go commando.  In that case, a thong is mandatory.  What to do??  A salesperson sold me on the Hanky Panky thong, and I'm thrilled to say that she didn't misguide me.  The fit is loose (I know, a loose thong?--but that's the best way I can describe it) so the fabric skims the outside of your body and doesn't wedge itself in.

Hardy,"Spanish Fork, Utah","Having enjoyed Isotoner slippers for many years, I was sorely disappointed when they changed their sizing/fit several years ago.  The package sizing remained the same, however, they decided to ""scrimp"" on the fabric.  Consequently, newly purchased slippers, though well within my known size range, (supposedly through a 10 1/2) still ran short in the toe (I wear a 10), thus far less comfortable.  Was I sure...you bet.  I still have an ancient pair that when I slip on, are an excellent fit.  

No stores carried sizes beyond XL...until I saw these on Amazon.  I ordered them in XXL and they really do fit.  Re-ordered 2 more pair for each of my daughters (who've had the same problem).

I have to give 4 stars as I've found their overall quality is not quite what it used to be...but at least they fit"

The best part is that, when your pants have slipped too low, you can pull them back up without the underwear bunching up."

It was certainly WELL worth the price I paid. 

If you like wearing extreme low-rise jeans or simply do not want to flash your waistband for any reason, then this brief is for you. Period. 

For those men who wear standard low-rise jeans or the like, then you do not NEED this, but you still very well may WANT it. 

Clearly this brief is meant to do two things (1) make it so that you can wear very low-rise pants and (2) make it so you look irresistable when you are NOT wearing your low-rise pants. 

I found that even though the underwear is cotton - as opposed to the synthetics of the X-Factor line, for example, this brief still conforms to my body's contours pretty well. Actually very well everywhere except it bunches a LITTLE where it meets the very inside of my thigh. Regardless, this is going to show off everything you got, and subsequently make it look (more-or-less) more impressive. 

Practical consideration: the pouch and the area above is reduced in size since it is accomodating the very low-rise. Translation: be cautious when you get aroused as there is not a great deal of ""expansion room"". Enough said on that, but that is why I gave this pair 4/5 stars. Everything else is great. I never had a problem with my rear being exposed in these briefs. 

If you forsee this as being a problem for you, then may I suggest the 2(x)ist Contrast Countour Pouch Brief 3103C? It is the same price (at review time) and the same materials but in a standard cut and features sexy contrast lines. I own it as well and you may read my review about it on its product page"

They are comfortable enough (maybe a little snug), but I though it was odd that they creased across (rather than to the rear of) the cap.  Within a few days, however, the skin-like coating (perhaps the waterproof layer?) of the uppers separated from the underlying leather, creating blisters in the creases.  Within a few weeks, those blisters tore, exposing the leather underneath.  I'm not sure where this will end, but at less than 2 months old, they will soon look too bad for dress wear.

I especially liked the original Hairigami and the spring rings.  The other products are good, too.  Some of them do take a bit of practice to get the hang of, but none of them are particularly complicated.

All of the products in the kits are durable and a good value for the money.  I recommend this product for anyone with long hair who wants to be able to do something with it quickly and still have it look stylish"

If they don't fit you have to go to the trouble of returning them to the vendor, and I, for one, really don't want to be bothered doing that.  I also hate buying shoes in a store and dealing with no customer service, crowds, and a limited shoe selection.  I do research before buying shoes from the Internet and really examine the size I'm getting before the purchase.

These Sauconys fit me very well.  The size is true; I ordered size 8.5 wide and that's what they are.  I have them on now, and they give me very good support.  They are lightweight and give me the support in the ankles that I need because I stand at work all day.  My ankles can really feel sore by the end of my shift without the proper shoes.  Also, the toebox is tapered but there is plenty of space for my toes.  The shoes provide enough room without looking clunky.

I just hope I will be able to buy the exact same shoe when the time comes to replace them.  Why do shoe companies insist on discontinuing a perfectly good style?  This makes it so much harder to purchase shoes on the Internet"

I wear both types ALL of the time and wear has been less than with the common loafer"

Considering one of the major perks of wearing a thong (compared with lesser styles) is how good it makes you look, this shortcoming is inexcusable. Even my girlfriend concedes that, although better looking than boxers or briefs (neither of which I wear), these are clearly below par for the style. There are plenty of alternatives that are more elegant and stylish. On Amazon alone there's the: Contour Pocket Thong, Extreme Thong, Glossy Thong, Microfiber Contour Thong, Microfiber Low-rise Thong, Skinz Thong and String Thong. Amazon even sells some excellent full backs: Contour Italian Cutaway Bikini, Microfiber Clip Bikini, Silk Extreme Brief and String Tricot Brief.

I didn't wear them long enough to have pain, but it definitely was getting uncomfortable. The other annoying thing was the straps wouldn't stay shut, the velcro kept releasing. I was constantly re-fastening them just the short time I wore them. The style is perfect, I hope Skechers tweaks this model to fix what is wrong.

Kovac,Somewhere in TX,"Great shoe for my milage.  I recently had my ""step"" analyzed by computer to make sure I was using the correct shoe as I prepared for a half marathon. I wanted two things: Comfort and Stability (to protect my ankles).  I tried out at least 7 different shoes.  The Asics GT-2110 felt the most natural in terms of the amount of ""give"" it had during each step.  Many others had more cushion but they felt too stiff as I launched off my toes. Previously I'd run in the 2100 shoe and (just for the record) I was very willing change brands.  In fact, I was willing to spend a lot more money to protect my knees and ankles.  Turns out it wasn't necessary.

I'm running 5-11 miles per day, both on a tred mill and the road and in both conditions I'm pleased with the shoe.  I have gotten a blister in the same place with both the 2100 and 2110 (just forward of my right arch), so I'm guessing it's my foot, not the shoe.  The 2100 was giving me blisters on my toes, but after going up one size when I bought the 2110's, that was resolved.

After a recent bad sprain (don't run in the dark!) I've been using a bulky ankle brace.  Even with the brace, the shoe has been very accomodating.  

I've run in wet conditions a few times and they haven't gotten too soggy, but I've yet to find a shoe that feels ""great"" in the rain. "

The one thing I was concerned with the older bag were the zippers.   At one point the teeth were not meshing on either the top or bottom sections and I was worried they were ruined.   But I simply ran both the zippers to the same end (using small force) and the teeth seemed to be fixed.

As a fan of retro 50's lingerie I love them both. They both have the same silky material that feels so slinky, but the Ravissant are not as sheer as the LN. Ravissants are  more plain jane quotidienne undies than the L.N., however I like to dress them up by wearing lace top stockings or even better a lacey garter belt under the panties as they are still sheer enough to be revealing.One small point is the sizing. I usually wear a size small in panties and the size 5 are a generous fit more like a medium. I like snug fitting panties, but not everyone does.

It is impossible to be a responsible consumer if you do not know what you are buying.  My poor review is based on this.  In my opinion technology has yet to replace the abilities of natural materials like wool and silk.  Of course, this is only my opinion and preference.  However, when manufactures refuse to inform and the buyer with more than ""Wool and Nylon Blend?"" there is no mechanism to a consumer to make an informed choice or even purchase what they are looking for.

Stretch nylon is certainly nice for form fit and ease when it comes to slipping your foot onto your sock and into your boot.  BUT - if too much nylon is present it will show its downside should the hiker or hunter find themselves in a wet situation and hiking for long periods.

It would seem that the age of the 100% wool sock is almost gone and I accept my fate, but I urge people to NOT buy a sock, which does not disclose the details of its manufacture.

The review reflects on ""full disclosure in advertising"" and not the product itself.  Should Amazon find it inappropriate then a deletion is understandable."

3:30pm The shoes arrived and I eagerly opened the box and put them on.  They feel quite a bit different from other shoes.  The sole is VERY springy!  The tongue is hurting my right foot and I'm concerned that I am going to need to return the shoes.  

4:30pm I take the shoes off and it turns out that the tongue (which is connected to the sides of the top of the shoe where the laces go through)is not centered quite right so I fold it in place and put the shoes back on.  I notice a difference instantly.  My wife comes home from work and says ""I don't like the way they look....but they are your shoes"".

By 5:30 I don't care how they look because they are soooo comfortable.  The soft leather uppers seems to fit the foot perfectly and the soft sole is still really springy.  The combination of these two is magnificent.

By 7pm I love these shoes so much that I am sitting at the computer writing a review at amazon!

I generally wear birkenstock and Dr. Marten shoes so I have spoiled my feet.  It is a fantastice surprise to get these shoes and find that they are even MORE comfortable than the Docs or the Birks.

Compact doesn't mean tiny. It is probably one of the smaller of the name-brand standard size ones I've seen (Kenneth Cole, Perry Ellis, Swiss Army, Nautica, etc), but it is not a different size category. Just a different shape, slightly less deep, yet has a nice solid broad base (the bottom is of a solid material which doesn't collapse). It is definitely big enough for the average man's toiletries.

I like it. It also doesn't have a lot of inside pockets. There is just one wallet-sized pouch inside which doesn't have its own zipper. Not a mesh. I'm not sure what it's big enough for - floss and lip balm? The rest of the inside is open and free. It has a water-proof lining and a wire with flaps to open the compartment wide (essential in a toiletries bag really). Well-crafted from what I can tell.

The outside is a very handsome patterned leather. It looks aged without looking worn. It also smells of leather out of the box - so much nicer than the faux-leather travel kits. You won't mind having your clothes rub against it in your luggage.

I have a slight quibble with the handle - it is not as easy to grab as in most kits. It's more of a loop than a handle.

So those are the cons: not a lot of compartments inside, not huge. Pros: leather, opens very wide, looks good, durable"

If you are looking for the 501 fit without the hassle of buttons, this may be the way to go.  The 505 is rather full in the seat and crotch (technically ""the rise"") and can look pretty baggy.  Though described as a ""slim fit"", the 512 is more of a moderate fit,  snug but not formfitting, much like the handsome 501.  Rather than slim fit, it really should be described as the 512 ""tapered leg"", because it has a pretty strong taper to the ankle, which means it will not fit over boots, unlike the 505 and the 501.  The only real downside of this jean is that comes in only one finish, a rather milquetoast medium stonewash.  Over time, however, it breaks in pretty nicely and looks good."

I work outdoors everyday and really need to keep all exposed areas covered. The Ear Grip works great!  Not only is it adjustable for any size head but it is worn around the back of the head so it isnt as noticeable as other options.  Since it is worn around the back of the head/neck it also keeps your neck warm too.  Compared to other ear muffs I have seen the Ear Grip wont make you look like a fairy.  There is no fluff/wild colors/fur here and you are still able to hear out of them.  They are made with a plastic loop that is covered with fabric.  The loop corresponds with your ear so the hole lines up with your ear and the fabric thats covering it is more than enough to keep you warm.   You can also take them off in a flash and compact them with a push and turn so they will fit in any pocket.  I highly reccomend them

The new ipod fits snugly in the case and the openings for the USB port and headphone jack align perfectly.  The magnetic closure is nice so you don't have to hear the sound of velcro ripping every time you want to open it.

My only complaint is that dust gets stuck between the plastic cover and the screen, but from what I've read that happens with every single case on the market except for the iSkin.  If you are going to be taking the ipod out of the case on a regular basis, this is a great alternative to the iSkin"

I asked them to please send the boots immediately because of the mistake.  They instead said that I had to contact FOGDOG directly.  I did and FOGDOG said sorry, we can only send you the boots if you order, pay for them again and pay for the express shipping.  Then return the excercise ball and get refunded for the original purchase.  I had to go out and buy the boots at a local store.  I am still waiting for the refund of the excercise ball and it has been 3 weeks.    

After many great purchases from Amazon over the years I am now saidly disappointed.  This will change my Amazon purchase plans in the future.   "

After a year the shirt looks great, I bought more because I have been a dull guy wearing the same black shirt every time I go to the gym.

Oh yeah, a major reason for selecting this shirt is it hangs loose around the waist.  This is good because paunches are not emphasized.  The competition's shirts(Nike)  allow you to show off your ""cut"" abs, I don't have any, so this is a good shirt for me"

The Tech T-shirt (0382) feels really good on your skin - like your favorite, most comfortable old cotton t-shirt. It looks just like cotton and has a matte finish - it's not shiny/silky like the Loose Gear shirts or Heat Gear compression shirts. It is very soft, comfortable and lightweight, and I love this shirt both for working out and casual wear. The shirt runs true to size (buy your regular T-shirt size and it will fit really well), and is the roomiest cut of the Under Armour shirts. I absolutely LOVE the raglan sleeves on the tech tee - one of the features that makes them so comfortable and gives them a little bit of a unique look.

The tech tee has a small amount of a lycra-like fabric in with the polyester microfiber, which gives it quite a bit of stretch. I like this because the shirt doesn't bind if you're doing something that really requires you to reach or stretch - certain weight exercises, aerobics, yoga, etc. The shirt works the way it's supposed to, and wicks moisture from your skin for rapid evaporation.

The tech tee is available in numerous colors (I have 6 of them) and in spite of the fact that the fabric is thin and lightweight, the shirts are very opaque. The shirts have a nice cut and look great over jeans or shorts - in addition to the gym, I often wear them out and around, or when working in the yard. They are super comfortable worn as an undershirt too, but are probably a little costly for that. Like all the Under Armour shirts, they have a self-material neck band, but it fits just right and says in place, even if you get sweaty - it doesn't sag like the cotton ones.

While I have zero complaints about the tech tee, be aware that it is Under Armour's ""budget"" product, if there is such a thing. The material does start to pill after a few washings - this affects appearance slightly, but not performance or fit. Although I haven't worn out ANY of my Under Armour shirts yet, I'm going to venture that the tech t-shirt won't be quite as durable as their signature Loose Gear shirts and Heat Gear compression shirts, nor does it perform quite as well. On the other hand it, it's about 20% cheaper, so as with anything else, you get what you pay for.

When stacked up against UA's other shirts, I'd say the tech tee is for you if:

1) You like the look and feel of a soft, cotton t-shirt but want the wicking and performance of a microfiber shirt.

2) You don't care for the shiny, silky, more synthetic look and feel of the Loose Gear shirts, or the tightness of the Heatgear compression shirt.

3) You want a shirt that's a little roomier.

4) You want a shirt with stretch in it.

5) You want to save a little $$ but still wear an authentic UA logo shirt"

Speaking of sweat, even after a hard workout this sports bra kept me feeling dry and comfortable, as well as secure.  The only slight drawback is the small reflective label in the middle of the back - it felt slightly scratchy when I first put the sports bra on, but I forgot all about it within a few minutes of starting my workout and didn't feel any scratching from that point onward.

At any rate, I find this underwear very stylish and I have the unanimous approval of any fortunate enough to see me donning them, male or female. 

My problem with them is that they wear out too quickly. Granted, I alternate between only two pairs. They breathe rather well but after 6 months or so they are A) rather dingy B) have running seams C) both. When I wear them I have the confidence that I could drop my pants in front of anyone without embarassment. Sometimes, while waiting for someone to come over, I make a point to put my pants on last. I enjoy walking outside to get the mail in them, and generally walking the line between nudity and clothedness, a joy any fellow metrosexual surely shares.

In conclusion, they are the best cut I have found (and I have searched the universe, so to speak). They have helped me ""close the deal"" several times, because they are simply gorgeous. They could be less expensive, if you ask me."

Particularly if you have a huge expanse of shoulder-to-shoulder area, this breaks up the monotony a little. Monocolor dri power tees work fine but these make the wear interesting enough to not look like something you'd wear as a shirt, and not under your shirt

The material is just as good, wicking away sweat fast. I've realized that the wicking keeps the dampness from creating that gym sock smell. Fresh sweat, gross as it sounds, doesn't have that sickening odor. And when it gets to evaporate fast, you can last a little longer before smelling like socks. I find the dri-powers most valuable if you have to go bike to get a coffee or small groceries and you don't want people in the store maintaining a perimeter around you"

I wore these out for the first time Friday night and although they have high heels, they aren't the hardest or most uncomfortable things to walk in.  I'm thinking for a neighborhood stroll or most activities these would be fine, maybe not a whole day of walking/shopping.  

They have plenty of room to stuff in your jeans if you want.  On jeans with a thinner leg, you can't really get by with wearing the boot under the jean or you can see the outline of the boot under there.

While the price is what initially attracted me to these shoes, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were constructed in a sturdy manner. There was no shoddy workmanship on these shoes. The soles were solidly attached to the body of the shoes. The velcro closure to the shoes is much appreciated as I did not want to waste time with lacing up shoes that could easily be untied. On a cosmetic level, the colors of the shoes were nice and neutral while still leaning towards boy's colors. 
I bought several of these in different sizes so that my boys will have comfortable shoes to wear as they grow. How nice it is to just reach up in the closet for the next size shoe!

Sizing Help:

To help clarify sizing for people (there have been conflicting reviews here), I ordered a Medium but then returned it for a L.  I will probably get some minor alterations, but I don't blame the company for that...everyone is shaped differently.

I am 6'0"" and weigh 175.  My suit measurements are a 42"" chest, 34"" sleeves, and 32"" pants inseam.  The Medium body fit but the sleeves and pants were too short.  The Large was the best fit overall, although roomier around the chest than I would prefer.  But if you are my size the Large is your best option."

Being large busted, but relatively small around (am normally a 32E, but am currently a 36E), it's very difficult to find bra's that provide adequate support, are comfortable, and that don't look like a granny-brasiere. Further, it's pretty much impossible to find a soft cup/non-underwire that does all of the above.

This bra is supportive, comfortable, pretty (the lace in the cleavage really does look like a cami under tops) and your breasts don't look like 'uni-boob.' One tip for new nursing moms: definitely don't use underwire bra's. I made that mistake at first (for the support) and got recurring mastitis--not fun AT ALL"

Although it does not have underwire support, it is very supportive (even for my 38DD size).  I switched to nonwire bras, when I found underwire bras to be uncomfortable (blocking milk ducts perhaps).  

As an added bonus, although it is a full coverage bra, it is quite pretty.  It has nice lace on the top, which looks like a pretty camisole under clothes.

Also, the 6 columns of hooks are fabulous!  I now believe all bras should have more columns of hooks so we can get more wear out of them.

I would definately recommend this bra.  It is more expensive than some others, but it is worth it"

The comfort techs are the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned.  This is my 5th pair.  They last long and feel like mocassins on your feet.  Great for trade show work.  Just a dream. 
"B000BWDTGY:florsheim_""riva""_excellence:neil_a._coddington_""abq-newyorker""",B000BWDTGY,Florsheim Men's Riva Slip-on: Apparel,apparel,,5.0,"Florsheim ""RIVA"" Excellence","January 9, 2007","Neil A. Coddington ""ABQ-NewYorker""","Albuquerque, NM","These are my 5th and 6th Florsheim Comfortech Rivas (Burgundy and Black).  I began wearing them in 1978, when they were sold under the French Shriner label and have not been without at least two pair ever since.  The design and production rights (thankfully) passed or were sold to Florsheim when the French Shriner marque disappeared.  

The shoes are the ULTIMATE IN COMFORT!  The uppers are of glove-soft kidskin and the soles of a firmly cushioned synthetic material.  They are suitable for everyday office wear as well as for use on formal occasions.

The factory finish is as durable as a patent leather, without the extremely high gloss plastic look.  

They are extremely durable, as some of them lasted me for more than twelve years of frequent wear.  I've never been able to wear out the one piece Comfortech sole and heel.  Ultimately, the uppers will wear through on the flex creases or at the base, where the upper is joined to the sole.  You can easily extend the wear period to ten years or more by occasional use of a good polish, especially after the shoes have been exposed to a wet environment.

They are an excellent buy at the suggested retail price of $100 to $110 that you see most often, but are an unbelievable bargain at the $90/pair charged by Amazon.

If I had a suggestion for minor improvement for Florsheim, it would be to make the sole slightly thicker and the heel slightly wider for greater stability.

I personally, would rate these shoes at six stars on a scale that had five stars for the next best shoe.  I would never go back to wearing dress shoes of conventional stiff leather and hard soles and heels.

These shoes are not perfect, but Florsheim has come VERY close with the Riva.

Give them a try -- I think you will come to love them as I do!

They're as comfortable as shoes get, and they are available in EEE widths and half sizes, so they fit me well.  Their soles are synthetic, not leather; this may make them less elegant, but it also at least quintuples how long they last.  The soles and heels never wear out for me; eventually the leather uppers get too scuffed to keep wearing them except around the house and yard.

Except for the tiny little ""buckle"" on the strap, they have no metal in them, which means they go through all airport metal detectors without setting them off.  The soles are thin, so I was never made to take them off at airport security either.  Well, not until the latest pointless revision of TSA rules.  Someday sense may return to airports, and then the lack of metal will be helpful again"

They do not have a built-in arch support (I do not like built-in arch supports so this was a plus for me).  They are washable which is another plus because in my opinion too many slippers marketed today are not washable and I will not purchase slippers that I cannot wash.  Even the sizing was appropriately done in my opinion, you should be able to order whatever slipper size you are comfortable with without concern.  The only drawback (and it can be a big drawback) is the plastic cords inserted into the product to keep them together:  one was inserted incorrectly with the result the plastic could not be totally removed.  Because of that I cannot wear the slippers.  The plastic was inserted through the bottom middle of the slipper and after removing the plastic we discovered a portion of it was coming up through the slipper bed and there was no way to remove it.  So, if you're looking for decent slippers these fulfill but the quality control with the plastic inserts might pose a problem.  Frustrating but the product itself is a five-star. "

The jacket itself is actually very pretty. It's beautifully lined and the cute dome buttons are unique. The color (Java for me) was exactly as pictured. The cut is excellent and very flattering to a fuller figure. The shoulder pads (not detachable) are somewhat annoying full, but nowhere near making anyone look like a football player.

For $24.99, this jacket is definitely worth it -- you would be hard pressed to find a jacket of good quality (cashmere claim not withstanding) for this price anywhere -- at least not one that looks more expensive than $24.99! I would not pay $178 (MSRP) for it, but at the current price, I just might go back and buy another one.

As for Amazon, I cannot sing enough praises about their excellent customer service! I have never had an issue that has not been resolved to my satisfaction"

Like any sandal, they are fun and easy to wear. Just recently I've noticed that the front part of the soles has worn down and they are smooth now. Also the foam bed has started to crack in several places, but for the price I'd say I've gotten reasonable use out of them.

The bottle opener is a great conversation piece. Also rest assured, they do hold up to wear and tear. I was skeptical when I bought these how long they'd stay intact, but I can attest that they are still in and functional... kinda mangled, but still intact and functioning.

Also, if you think you're just gonna swing your leg up and crack open a beer like Mr. Joe Cool, then think again. I remember when I first got these I was at a backyard house party while in San Diego. I was flirting with these two girls, talkin' my game and trying to be super cool. So I grab another beer, and while talking to them, I lift my foot and try to crack the bottle open. Well, between trying to keep my balance and get the lip of the cap in the opener, I apparently shook it up a bit. When I finally did open it, the resulting explosion of foam shot all over me and the two girls. Not cool.

I would suggest taking the sandal off to use the bottle opener feature.

All and all, a great shoe. Fun and easy to wear.

Another tip: Make sure you wash these every so often! Stick 'em in the washing machine. I neglected to do this and developed a nasty case of athlete's foot from them. Just a heads up. Enjoy"

 here is how you measure. put you foot ( if even doesn't matter wich foot, if uneven use the loner foot to determine your size). take a 11x12 paper and make two marks one at the heel and one at the big toe then look at the chart put your finger on the inches (foot measurement) and run across  to see your size. remember these sandals only run in whole sizes, so if your half go up one. also know your width

The strap is ample and the handle is convenient for carrying the backpack.  I wish the zippered compartment's lining was a light color, but at least it opens up to give you exposure to locate items that sometimes fall to the bottom of the purse. The hidden compartment mentioned in the description is very small and doesn't have much room for a lot of items.

slightest movement? i dont think so. no the adapter doesn't fit in the jack as well when it is in this case but it does fit. if your going to buy a car charger for your zen i would suggest you buy the one that you don't need the adapter for it,plus it charges faster, just like the wall charger. i only use the adapter at home. the headphone jack lines up fine. 

From another review: The fold-over flap isn't designed well. First of all, it gets in the way of the headphone jack, so that many times when I opened the flap, it pulled my headphones out of the headphone jack.

The part about the headphones is beyond me. You can put the headphones in the jack two ways. you can completely close the case, and the foldover flap and then put the headphones in, like when youre not going to be changing songs alot. I do this when I am working out at the gym. The second way is to have the headphones inserted with the case on but with the fold over flap/screen protector, open. I do this in my car so if I want to change a song while driving the buttons are right there. I have never had the headphones pull out of the jack and ive had it over three months and i wear it everyday to the ymca.

and then theres....
Finally, and this is a real deal breaker, is the fact that you cannot plug in the adapter to the bottom of the player when the case is on. You have to pull the player out every time you want to sync or charge you player, which is a big hassle.

this is also not true. i didnt think it would fit right either when i got this in the mail. but it does fit. you just can't button the case closed. i can use the adapter or my wall charger(which has the same size port as my zen, thank god) while this case is on my zen.

and then...
The case is to small for the player. When i tryed to put the player in the case it was a tight fit, when i finally got it in the case the bottom buttons on the player were being pushed down by the case. This case also adds a lot of bulk to the player as well and is very uncomfortable to use. Don't listen to anybody who thinks this product was great, they are lying.

the case does seem tight but thats how you should want it. you don't want your zen shaking around in the case do you? this case does not press the buttons down. it does take some getting used because you have to press harder to get to the buttons. but the scroll pad is right there in the open so you don't have to worry about that.

I have had this case since i bought my zen. i bought it on ebay for 10 bucks. yes it does seem to add some bulk to the zen but i like it. ive dropped it twice all ready while in this case and there is no damage. it actually seems to have some shock absorbtion due to its studriness/thickness. and people whining about the beltclip....the only time i put the zen with case in my pocket is at the gym. i put it in my pocket and the clip on the outside of my shorts. i am upside down when i do decline bench press and upside down when i do situps, it has never fallen out or even seemed like it was going to slide out of my pocket. if you care about your zen like i do this is probably the best case to get for it. best ive seen anyway. dont go for them cheap rubber/plastic covers(you know which ones i am talking about). Also on the inside of the cover/flap there is a ""secret"" slot where you can put money or an ID even. its sweet yes? high five!

people seem to be knit-picking this thing in alot of the reviews i've read. buy this case, and learn how to use it before you get on here and roast it all right? ive had it as long as i have had my zen and it is great no matter what you are doing."

I decided on the iSkin, and I have been quite satisfied with my decision. I do remember, however, being a bit confused as to just how this case worked. So, to clarify for future buyers, the case is comprised of:

-First, a thin, transparent silicone (rubber) sleeve. The sleeve covers most of the front and back, including a slightly thinner cover where the wheeel would be placed. This ensures that the wheel maintains its touch sensitivity while also being protected. The skin does not, however, cover the screen, and a portion of the back is also exposed to attach an optional belt clip. This sleeve can also come in various colors, but I used the clear one to highlight the natural color of my iPod. 

-Second, a hard, clear plastic front plate can be snapped on to the front of the iPod once it is placed in the silicone. This hard case does cover the screen, and all of the front of the iPod, except for a hole for the touch wheel. Once attached, the hard cover is firmly held in place. 

Put together, this case provides exceptional protection. The silicone is very thin, yet protects against ordinary dings and scratches. The hard plastic protects the front from impact, and the screen from scratches. The best part for me is that, even with both the silicone and the hard cover, the iPod Nano still retains its very thin size - the case is not bulky in the least. 

In conclusion, I highly recommend this case for anyone who purchases an iPod Nano. Protect your investment"

One small complaint was the instructions for removing the belt clip - they didn't adequately explain the removal, leaving me worried that I'd break the clip, but with some small effort, I got it.

The inner silicone layer (which you get three of in different colors) covers the nano perfectly, even providing click-wheel protection without compromising the sensitivity of the wheel (like other cases can.) The hard outer shell protects the screen very nicely and stays in place well.

The only things I don't like is that you only get one of the hard outer/front pieces, two would be nice to have just in case something happened to the first so you wouldn't have to go and buy a whole new pack. 

I do recommend this product though as it protects the iPod nano without changing any of its functionality and keeps the size almost exactly the same"

Funny, I know!","April 4, 2005",None,Virginia,"I have to laugh at myself, writing a review for a T-Shirt of all things, but I gotta tell you, this is no ordinary T-shirt!  A year ago I bought one of these shirts in a local store and fell completely in love with it.  It's now a year later, I love it just the same, and I can't find them anywhere, except Amazon (thank God!)  The one I have just happens to have a silkscreen on it, and after a year of constant use (for work) the silkscreen still looks great.  When you compare this shirt to a 100% cotton shirt, these wear MUCH lighter & cooler, even though it says ""heavyweight.""  Don't let that scare you as it's not ""heavy"" at all.  With constant washing over the last year, the Hanes shirt has kept its color, unlike my 100% cotton shirts of the same age which have faded much faster.  Also, if you tend to perspire, these shirts will wick away the moisture more quickly and will not show it nearly as much as a 100% cotton shirt would.  Also nice is that they don't shrink or wrinkle.  I wish I had known about these shirts years ago...  Don't kick yourself years down the road when you buy one of these shirts by accident and wonder where its been all your life (like I did), get it now and enjoy it"

This is a messenger bag, not a backpack. A messenger bag was and is never meant to hold all the items a backpack can. So basically, if you're using this bag for school purposes, keep this in mind. This bag can hold items for possibly up to 3 classes. So while it's perfect for a college student who might have a class, then another class right after it. This bag would be horrible for a high school student, who might have to drag home texts for six classes.

Of most messenger bags, the Elefunk bag is probably going to be your best choice, cause of its size and number of compartments. We have 3 of these bags, 2 of which are used for education, and the third is used as a utility/diaper family bag. For education, as I stated before, it's best for college students. The main compartment is spans out and can hold 2 college texts, binders, and study guides snug. Keyword there is snug, cause it's not big enough to carry more. Inside the main compartment is a little sleeve held tight by a velcro patch. I use this to keep my study guides from my texts. Okay, next comes the the front pocket attached to the main compartment. This compartment is big enough to fit my 12 inch iBook in a neopreen cover, or a 13 inch MacBook bare. Warning, if you place your MacBook in this pouch, careful how you toss this bag around, cause it offers no padding and is very unforgiving. Inside this front pouch is a zippered sleeve fine for putting loose change or maybe id cards or what not. Next to the zippered sleeve are two pouches for pens and pencils, even a TI calculator, that is if you're not planning on putting your notebook in that pouch. Don't worry though, cause attached to that pouch on the outside are two zippered compartments opposite one another to the front pouch. On one side I put my black leather data file, and on the other side, I put my TI-89 calculator. Then that leaves the flap, which is secured to the bag using strong plastic clips. On the front of the pouch is a zippered compartment. Which I pretty much can only use it to pack up a couple magazines to read, if I'm waiting between classes. You can also use it to pack up headphones or earbuds, to listen to you iPod or whatever. As for the shoulder strap, it's about as comfy as it's going to get. Keep in mind, you're lugging 20 to 30 pounds of books and supplies, it's not suppose to feel like a Chinese massage. But I can't complain.

As for a family bag. Eh, I wouldn't suggest this to a newly mother who wants to go down to a mall. Cause stores will not let your take this bag in there. But if you're on a trip, or going on a flight, this bag is excellent. You can pack away all your babies needs, and other essentials.

Anyway, I just didn't like seeing a product I use, and like, getting knocked, cause a couple people misjudged how to use it properly. Again, if you're taking more than 2 or 3 classes at a time, this bag isn't for you. But if you're a run of the mill college student, who takes a class or two at a time, then goes home. This bag is a must"

Schoonmaker,"High Falls, NY  USA","My poor son got deprived of backpacks and bookbags because of being homeschooled, but now that he's a college student, he can carry books!  This means the 5 star rating might be biased by the sheer pleasure of simply having something to feel like fitting in with the crowd, but to be fair and honest about this product...I admit it does look like a quality item.  

It's built practical, looks good, and (having to guess) I'd say it's probably better suited for college use rather than high school.  For some odd reason being in college doesn't require as many books to be carried in one day as I see what high school students have to carry.

If this bag was a dual set with each bag on opposite sides, it would seem to resemble the old-fashioned saddle bags (except it's not leather, is maybe a little bit larger in capacity, and has plenty of individual compartments and zippers). "

I washed my jacket for the first time and it still looks perfect! I think it shrank just a tiny bit, which only made it fit better!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If I can give this jacket 100 stars I would! I have yet to wear it (arrived today, tried it on) and I LOVE IT! It's the perfect weight for Texas winter and would transition well into spring... My only regret (like everyone else who has reviewed it) is that I did not buy one in each color! I monitor Amazon's prices almost every 2 hours so hopefully I'll be able to buy a couple more when the prices drop!

The jacket is definitely great quality -- nicely lined and does not smell or stink, sign of high-quality tanning process. (I'm wearing another non-washable suede jacket that cost 4 times more and it reeks of tannins. Ugh.)

A caveat, though: I did not go by Amazon's sizing chart. I searched all over the web for Live A Little/AMI's size charts and Nordstrom's has it. Go by that chart instead of Amazon's for a perfect fit!

For those who hesitated the last time, when this baby drops in price again, go for it! Well worth the money, well worth the time and well worth monitoring Amazon hourly for"

Willy ""Kricket""",Minnesota,"I am sort of a workout junkie, to be more specific, a ""FIRM"" workout junkie. I like how intense the FIRM is, and I sort of look for that in the workouts that I do. Now this workout is good, not as intense as the TransFIRMer workouts that were just out. Don't get me wrong: I have the 6lb ball, and you use it for 90% of the workout. At the end, I was definately ready to put it down, so it did work me out.
Pros: Different change of pace using the ball; lots of moves that strengthen your core; a fun and different stretch at the end using the ball; Tina Smalley is a precise leader that is easy to follow.
Cons: I miss the old FIRM master instructors that were in all the other videos. Just Allie and Allison were in this one. They didn't even introduce the others. There was no changes in weight, which used to be the way to spot an ""ineffective workout"" according to the ""old"" FIRM tapes. And lastly, In my humble opinion, the ball is a little gimicky. A good 5lb weight held on the dumbell ends would work about the same. 
  Still worth giving it a shot for different days. You'll sweat, but you'll wonder, ""Is this REALLY the FIRM?"

So when Levi's introduced this new fit, the Slim Straight, I purchased a pair and tried it out. The 514 has a very large range of sizes and trendy washes, and is usually on sale for a very reasonable price at $30.

I recommend this fit for thin men, tall or short, who I think look best on. Men who aren't comfortable with wearing tight jeans shouldn't purchase this fit, because it is certainly figure revealing. It's slimmer around the thigh, unlike the Skinny 511 jeans, where it's much tighter around both the calf and the thigh. The waist is a low rise, which I find very comfortable while wearing, and the leg opening is a straight cut. The 514 shrinks slightly when washed and dried.

I personally think this fit is better looking than the Skinny 511, which I believe is just a fad for now. The Skinny has a sort of tapered-mom-jean look to it, and I don't think anyone will agree that a guy looks good in that! I suggest you try these jeans out before buying them, and see how you like them. As for me, I like them so much, I think I'll be purchasing another pair in the future"

The grooves provide good solid grip for your feet, and though it was a little slick at first, after I washed it and used it for a while it became nice and sticky.  But above all, the reason you are probably considering this mat rather than a cheap(er) one is... the beautiful pattern.  I selected the blue one, and I've gotten so many compliments.  More importantly, it makes me enjoy my workout even more.  Ah, and the kicker - the pattern isn't just surface (as the other reviewer pointed out), but continues through the entire mat, so you can't wear it away with use.  Certainly recommended"

Hawkins ""Laura Wilde""",USA,"Yoga mats come in three basic thicknesses. At 1/8"" this mat is of average thickness. Mats that are about half a thick as this one are good for travel or placing under a thicker mat to provide more traction. The thick mats (3/16"") are about 50% thicker than this one and are designed for those who need or want extra cushion. At 24"" x 68"" it's of average length and width.

These mats are really beautiful! As a professional, I'm normally not concerned with the look of a mat; it's performance and ease of use are of primary concern. However, these mats are stunning! You'll definitely get oohs and aahs from your fellow yoga enthusiasts when you roll these out. The blue one looks like the ocean and the orange on looks like liquid lava! I especially love how the design goes all the way through the mat and isn't just 'printed' on one side. The design on your mat will last as long as your mat will. 

There are two sides to this and nearly all yoga mats. Look carefully at the 'bumps' on each side of the mat. The larger bumps are designed to face upwards to cushion your hands, feet, and knees during poses while keeping your body from dangerously slipping out of alignment. The smaller bumps are designed to face downwards to grip the floor and keep the yoga mat from sliding. Many mats have a label on one end with the name of the brand. This is typically, but not always, located on the 'up' side. The bumps will tell you for sure. 

This yoga mat will increase in softness and stickiness with use. (So do most mats.) They start out mildly sticky and increase in stickiness the more they are used. You will want to wash your mat when it first arrives so as to remove the thin film they get on their surface during the manufacturing process. Instructions for washing the mat are included. Once you've washed and dried your mat you're ready to begin! After using it for a while, if you find the mat decreasing in stickiness each time you pull it out, this is the typical sign that a light coating of dust or too much body sweat has accumulated on your mat and it needs a light hand washing with very diluted soap and water. After washing, roll your mat in a thick towel to squeeze out the excess water, otherwise it will take forever to dry in the air. Then, air dry your mat unrolled, inside, and away from sunlight. (Hanging over the shower bar works nicely.) 

When you first unroll your mat you will find one end to be a bit curled. Simply alternate the direction you roll your mat (top outside once, then bottom outside next) or the end you start from (curled end once, flat end next time) and you'll find it straightening out more or less over time. 

I recommend buying your own yoga mat even if your yoga studio or gym provides them for you. I've worked in many studios and gyms over the years. Sometimes management has mats cleaned often, sometimes not. If you bring your own mat you always know where it's been. :o) Plus, owning your own mat may encourage you to begin valuable practice at home. 

For my students who have trouble with their knees in some of the poses requiring the body weight to rest on a knee, I recommend temporarily folding over one end of the mat to get double cushion under the knee while still leaving one layer under the rest of the body. This saves you having to haul more than one mat out each time you practice which can be discouraging especially to the beginner."

I didn't think my backpack would be secure from pickpocketers, and I wanted something a little more ""grown up.""  Here are some reasons I am very happy with this purchase:

1) Comfort.  My Healthy Back Bag is more comfortable than either a backpack or a large purse.  Its wide strap sets securely on my shoulder without a hand on it, and it adjusts easily so I can carry it across my chest.  You can put a lot in it and not feel the weight - you will not end up with your shoulder in knots at the end of the day.

2) Security.  The zippered compartment openings fit neatly beneath my armpit; there are interior zipper pockets as well, so it's pretty hard to imagine someone's hand slipping into the bag without my knowing it.  The wide strap is reinforced so it would be hard to cut.

3) Convenience.  This bag has supremely well-designed features.  On the outside, there is a flat zipper pocket (good for your subway pass) and a separate velcro pocket on one side, a velcro pocket with a flap on the other, and a small pocket suitable for (say) sunglass on the end. The main zipped compartment has a wide variety of open pockets (for perhaps a pen, a camera, a PDA or Ipod), including one conveniently placed sidways so you can easily get at it from when it's still on your shoulder.  That one is perfect for a cellphone.  There is a flat inside zipper pocket that serves me well as a wallet.

4) Capacity.  I've got the small version of the bag, and it will still hold a wide variety of daily essentials: wallet, phone, camera, ipod, a paperback, a compact umbrella, and even perhaps a very light sweater.

The biggest problem with these bags is figuring out which one you want - err on the small side (they are more comfortable), then choose whatever fabric and color suits your fancy.  You can even get them in a premium leather, but my microfibre one seems easy to clean and a good value.

This is my favorite bag - I can easily see several decades in my future with a Healthy Back Bag under my arm."

This is the best one so far since it eliminates the need for clothespins, is better at holding wet, heavy clothes and the clothes don't slide. My only complaint is I wish it had suction cups and clips on the ends like my other travel clotheslines so I could hang it in the bath/shower or attach it to poles.  My previous clotheslines had those features and I used them alot. To work around this I use a small carabiner on each end.  This travel clothesline would be PERFECT if it offered all those features."

No clothespins are needed, because you can attach your clothes inside the braid of the rubber.  It packs up into almost nothing and weighs almost nothing.

You take one end of the clothesline, wrap it around something, such as a pipe or a bedpost, or even a doorknob, and loop it through itself.  You then take the other end of the clothesline, along with a small hook (you have to get one separately), and hook it to itself.  

This can hold a lot of weight - I've had two pairs of wet jeans along with 2 pairs of wet shirts, socks, and underwear all on the line at the same time.  Sure, it'll sag, but it's no problem.

Don't get any of the clotheslines that have suction cups on the end - what if all you have around is wood and concrete?  Then there'll be nothing to suction the cups to.  You can't really hang your clothes to dry in a bathtub when you share the bathroom with other people.."

When I first noticed my clothes weren't fitting anymore (around 11 weeks), I went maternity clothes shopping and was completely discouraged by the lack of clothes for early pregnancy. When I got my Bella Bands, I automatically felt better about myself! So far, they have four fabulous functions that have been a life-saver:
1. Make shorter, non-maternity shirts appear longer so you can wear them for longer
2. Allow you to wear non-maternity pants with the button undone - even jeans!
3. Hold the bands of maternity pants up so you can wear those earlier.
4. Keep everything tucked in a supported so you feel more confident and less flabby.
So far, I'm wearing them tucked over once, but I'm sure later in my pregnancy I will expand them to full size and they'll be an added comfort and peace of mind. EVERY newly pregnant woman needs to get these by month 3!!"

I reluctantly bought a bella band (at a salesperson's suggestion) thinking that it would be one of those products that I would come to regret spending so much money on. Surprisingly, it was the best thing I purchased when I was pregnant. I actually was able to get away with not buying any maternity clothes and just wearing my old clothing but with the pants or jeans unzipped and unbuttoned. In the last month, however, I had to wear more stretchy clothes- even my jeans would not fit with the bella band. But it is great because you can have it peek out from under the shirt you are wearing for a layered look. It is just a great product. Can't say enough good things about it. I am now pregnant with my 2nd child and have used the same bella band. It really keeps its elasticity. Overall, it was really worth it's weight in gold because I saved myself from buying so many maternity clothes"

I work a corporate job and did not want to buy a whole new wardrobe of pants, so I wear the bella bands every day with my work pants unzipped and no-one can tell. They look like you are wearing a tight camisole and even help to streamline unwanted pregnancy love handles! I bought the 3 pack and have worn all of them several times. I literally wear them everyday. They are really comfortable and definitely buy the next size up - I ""was"" a size 6-8 and a size two is perfect. Fold them over in half for a tighter fit or wear the top half over your tummy like a cummerbund so it keeps warm in winter!! I am 20 wks and have been wearing them for 3 weeks now, so buy them as soon as you start having to undo that top button!!

They are really good quality and I washed and put mine the dryer by accident and it didnt even shrink. Worth every cent!"

I was hesitant to spend the money on these but after searching the net for this and similar products figured I'd give it a try.  
BUY THESE EARLY LADIES!  I waited until my 24th week to buy the bands and today slipped on a pair of pants I haven't worn in 2 months, unbuttoned and unzipped even, but nobody could tell with the bella band on.  The look was cute and layered and not bunchy.  The nice material even felt great under my shirt and no more belly button 'hole' showing!
I'm going up to my 'skinny clothes' box to pull out items I can wear with my bella band on. I'm so excited to use this now and post-pregnancy.
PS - they even came with a nice surprise bag of Skittles, heaven to me"

The two twisting strands were very helpful--no clips required.

The handbag came with an authentication card, the original ITALIAN price tag (it really WAS 500 Euros!), and a dust bag for storage.  It looks genuine with the ""PRADA"" triangle tag on one side and a leather ""PRADA label inside the bag... the labeling is subtle and not at all ""in your face"".  Perfect gift!

Whether it's woodworking or small construction projects, I tend to stress jeans in three places, the right pocket where my tape measure slides on, the back pockets, and the crotch area.  The Riggs jeans are reinforced in all three areas.  Also, I am 6'7"" and weigh 260 lbs.  Needless to say, it is difficult to find clothes that fit.  I read about Wrangler's Riggs jeans in a magazine article about work clothing and decided to try them.   The jeans I bought were size 40x36.  I have been wearing them now for two months and have no complaints.  The cloth is thicker and hardier than normal jeans, something I found helpful when cutting trees for firewood.  The pockets are deeper (something I very much appreciate), and the build quality of the jeans is excellent - triple stitching in all the important areas.  I think the part that really tops the whole deal off is the price.  These jeans were priced at $27 with free shipping.  Excellent product, excellent price.  What more can I say"

You've got a very decent amount of colour choices, and you can pick between a brass and silver buckle. I picked the silver & black combination, when it shipped it was more then I expected; for the same exact thing at a local mall you would pay twice as much and that's not considering tax. The only difference between this one and other belts of similar design that I've seen is that they all seem to have logos, either engraved or cut out. I don't enjoy sporting I giant logo on my waist. I much rather get what I want AND pay less for it. 

The buckle is not a design that opens and closes, rather you slip the belt through the buckle and tighten it by sliding a metal bar foward. If you close it tightly enough, it will hold a LOT of weight, far more then the open/slip belt through/close buckle on belt design. I carry a bunch of things on mine, including a heavy multi-tool, a knive, a phone, several pouches filled with a various manner of junk, a tape measure, and occasionally heavy construction tools. Granted the belt wasn't meant for this kind of weight but...normally after a few minutes my old buckle would just pop open from the weight...no such problem here. 

It opens and closes without trouble and will fit a large waist easily. What more do you want from a belt?! =)

As a buxom woman (36DDD), I'm cursed with ""wandering"" nipples, bra lines showing through shirts and sweaters, bossoms that ""swing low"" and other embarrassing problems. This bra is relatively comfortable generally speaking, and it is VERY comfortable compared to minimizers and other ""hold'em up and hold'em in place"" bras. Personally, I think the svelt look of the bra is gorgeous.  With a big chest, I've never been able to wear those lacy little bras from Victoria's Secret, so this is actually a big improvement over what my husband refers to as ""industrial strength"" bras like our grandmothers wear. I only give it four stars because the underwire is not comfortable if you sit for long periods of time at a desk like I do; it begins to ""dig in"" a bit right beneath the rib cage.  Overall, it's a great bra to (1) hide nipples, (2) provide your breasts with a wonderfully rounded shape, (3) hides bra lines (great t-shirt bra), and (4) show off your cleavage but not the bra itself (if you wear a low cut blouse).

This bra is the one that Oprah wears and loves. Now it is my favourite thing. 
I have to agree with the other customers that it is not the prettiest bra if you are a bigger chested gal like my self, but you forget about that when you put a t-shirt or blouse on, because you really do look 10 pounds thinner around the waist and you chest is where it should be. 
If you are a bigger chested gal, I would suggest before buying this bra, if you are not too sure what size you are, go and get fitted at a proper store....a specialty store. Most stores only sell bras in the A-DD cup, that is why you should go to a specialty store, the sales women know a lot more"

Kanneganti,New York,"This is a beautiful, well-made dress shoe that combines traditional oxford design with high quality materials. It features a smooth, full grain, blemishless, fully lined, leather upper, and a flexible leather sole with rubberized contact patches*. There is not much more that an Allen Edmonds, costing hundreds of dollars more, will get you.

I got one in size 15M, which is my normal shoe size. Size 15M in this shoe is relatively tight-fitting at the arch, in comparison to my Florsheim 15M oxfords (two different models). So, the gentleman that remarked in earlier comments about the size being a tad smaller is correct. If I had known, I would have gotten a half-size bigger. However, that would have added unnecessary shoe length when all I needed was a quarter inch of additional coverage at the arch. I wish shoe makers had an arch fitment scale like they have with the width of the foot, i.e., medium, wide, extra wide, etc.

* an earlier commenter mentioned that the rubberized outer lining on the sole started to come unglued after only a few months of wear; I cannot comment on this aspect yet as I have had these for only a few weeks yet, and have worn them only three or four time to date. I will update this review if I discover that I have this problem also"

It took a couple of days to break the shoes in due to the firm footbed and heel cup, but once they were broken in, it was bliss. A good friend of mine recently had plantar fasciitis herself and also began wearing the Arizona Birks. Ever since my own PF episode, I've avoided going barefoot around the house and wear only the Arizona Birks while indoors. They've held up remarkably well, and I dread the day something accidentally happens to them which means I have to buy another pair of Arizonas just in case.

I know they're more expensive than most sandals -- mine cost $110 at a mall store -- but they're worth the money. I have flat feet, while my friend has a really high arch, yet the Arizona Birks work wonderfully for both of us. I now have about 12 pairs of Birkenstocks in a variety of styles, and plan on buying more. Birkenstocks give tremendous support with its toe grip and molded footbed, especially since it conforms to your foot within a few days. If you want the best variety of Birks, you should check out the QVC website. They have dozens of styles, and some of the best prices on Birkenstocks around"

I think the price is what has kept me from buying them and have always gotten sandals without reguard to who makes them as long as they were in the $20 range.  

After my last pair fell apart I decided to spend the extra money for Birkenstocks.  I am glad I did.  You can tell how well made they are right out of the box.  They are extremely comfortable to wear, and the footbed is firm but soft.  The longer you wear them the more comfortable they get.  I like the birkibuc material better than leather as it seems to be more water resistant.  The arch is solid and in just the right spot for proper support.  The part where the strap is attached to the sole is seamless and very well done.  

I am very happy about purchasing the sandals and I recommend them highly.  Your feet won't hurt wearing them all day like some sandals or flip flops.  One thing to watch out for, it says the size measures true but the first pair I ordered were much too big and I had to send them back for a smaller pair.  I used the conversion chart the seller has, but you may want to order a half or full size smaller than you normally would.  The ones I have now are size 41 and are supposed to be for size 8 US, but I am a true size 9 and these fit me with room to spare.       "

Just my  opinion.  Hanes does make a lot to choose from, so, they are great and  reasonably priced.

B000LR9ZTE:the_best_briefs_in_town_!!!:matthew_g._sherwin,B000LR9ZTE,"Hanes Men's Classic Basic Brief, Three Pack: Apparel",apparel,19 of 24,4.0,The best briefs in town !!!,"April 15, 2007",Matthew G. Sherwin,"Brewster, New York United States","Hanes makes an excellent white traditional brief for the gentlemen amongst us who just don't want to wear boxers. The relatively snug fit ensures that these briefs will not ""bunch up"" like loose fitting boxers so often do; and many men prefer these briefs for that reason alone.

The briefs are easy to care for; they are essentially permanent press so any washer and dryer set will clean them well. They seem to last forever, too, which makes them an excellent value.

If you can, try to get these without a tag in the rear so that you won't get an itch caused by the tag. However, even with a tag you usually don't feel any discomfort. I've worn 'em that way for years without a problem. The 100% cotton fibers of these briefs add to the comfort you'll feel, too. 

My only real caution--and the main reason that this product gets four stars instead of five--is that these briefs can be tight the first several times you wear them. This may be true for some of us men even if Hanes does claim that these briefs are preshrunk before they hit the store's shelves. I personally would suggest washing them once or twice just to loosen the fit up ever so slightly. Another relatively minor concern is that the elasticity of the waistband eventually does wear out. At that point you do need to buy new briefs--but, then again, nothing lasts forever, right?

Overall, gentlemen who want a close fitting brief that still gives them comfort will be very satisfied with these white men's briefs. The three pack gives you value and they last a long time."

Yet, all the robes in department stores were light and not nearly warm enough.

I found this robe after a long search and have been very pleased.  It keeps me very warm and is easy to throw on and off.  It's made of absorbent material so that I don't feel cold water spots on my back after getting out of the shower.  It's the heaviest robe I could find.

I can't say there are any complaints.  It is a little big for me (one size fits all) and the sleeves do get in the way and knock things over on my bathroom counter, but warmth is what I was after, and this fills that bill."

Pros:

1. It gives you a fairly accurate preview of the weight of your luggage (+/- a few ounces) saving you the irritation of arriving at the airline counter with over-heavy luggage, and having to repack and shuffle potentially embarrassing items around in full view of the other passengers.

2. You can use the tape measure to verify that your carry-on luggage will fit in the overhead compartment, or under the seat.  This saves you from participating in the dreaded and ruthless shoving tournament of the skies, where people try to stuff bags the size of newborn elephants into the overhead lockers.

Cons:

1. It has the capacity to weigh suitcases up to 75 lbs, but when you're traveling alone, it's very awkward to lift a suitcase even half that weight with your arms extended (so that it doesn't touch your body) and still read the tiny numbers on the dial. 

2. The handle is small and ""ergonometrically-challenged"", and people who can't lift a 50 lb suitcase with one outstretched hand will find it very difficult to get two hands in there.  Even if you do manage to get this far, you won't be able to hold it for long before the handle sinks deep into your palm, cutting you a new lifeline.

3. You need to try to balance the suitcase by centering the hook on the suitcase handle, but if you lift too quickly, the hook slips to one side, causing possible grievous bodily harm as the suitcase comes down on your toe.

4. Another hook problem - you can see that the hook is an open design. If you are lifting the suitcase, the hook can slip off on the way up, causing the suitcase to fall as in 3. above. Even worse, the momentum keeps your hand moving upwards, and not only can you give yourself a shiner or broken nose with the back of your hand, but the hook can swing up and jab you in the eye. (True story)


You can use it on lighter luggage without too many problems, but then again, if your luggage is light you have no need to fear the scale - do you?  On the surface this sounds like a great travel gadget, but beware of the pitfalls.

After buying this luggage scale, I now measure each of the bags, distribute load well and know how much to shop and pack.

The scale is pretty accurate, the weights that I see in the airline checkin counter is pretty much the same as what I have measured at home.

Highly reccomended for all travellers"

Draper,,"My son got the honor of playing ring bearer at a friend's wedding, but the problem of finding a tux to fit an 18 month old was difficult. Everywhere we looked, the price was actually going to be *more* than renting an adult tux! 

As much as I try to help the local economy, I hate to say, I was delighted to find a tux online for nearly half the price as the local stores. The suit fit my son nearly perfectly, and was very easily adjusted in places that were slightly too large (my son has little to no bottom, so all of his pants will eventually fall off if I don't clothes pin them in back... that was nothing new).

In addition to this being adorable, it's COMPLETE. Even the comberbun. Needless to say, he, and the suit were a hit. 

I am very, very happy with this purchase"

I like that it has an ample storage pocket for extra batteries and SD cards, and I like the easy-open U-shaped zippers.  No corners to negotiate, and no top cover to flip up and hold out of the way while you butterfinger your camera in and out of the case.  Pretty weatherproof and shockproof, too.  It provides great protection for your camera.

I got a little carried away and kept the USB cable for my camera in the accessory pocket along with two extra batteries and a media card.  And this actually worked for several months (!) before I broke the zipper.  I could have bought a differently designed replacement case locally--there are dozens and dozens of them--but none were anything like as suited to my needs and tastes as this little CaseLogic.  So I ordered another one from Amazon exactly like the one I ruined.

If there's anything I'd change about the case, it would be to add a small hand strap.  But that's not been an issue for me.  If I want to carry it in my hand, I just slip a finger through the belt look and carry it that way.

I've learned my lesson about storing the USB cable in the accessory pocket.  So I'm expecting the replacement to easily outlast my camera"

Geyer ""outcast_searcher""","Lexington, KY USA","This case will (barely) hold my 5.1 MP Sony Cybershot digital camera in the large zippered pouch.  The small zippered pouch is nicely configured for holding extras like batteries, extra memory sticks, etc, with the padded pouch and a webbed rear wall with velcro to secure the webbing -- giving two practical accessory sections. 

The belt loop is well made, strong, well secured, and doesn't have velcro or snaps (which I hate, since I fear losing the camera that way), so this thing will stay on your belt, worry free. The zippers appear strong, and don't bind or act sticky. 

It feels light and fits comfortably to my side or back via my belt. It is reasonably attractive as such bags go, especailly for the low price.  The display cardboard it came mounted on (I bought mine at a discount store) said it had a lifetime warranty, and it looks like it was made with a LONG life in mind).  The padding appears sufficient all around to resist normal bumps, etc.  (though I would fear a drop on concrete). 

I actually bought this to hold my tiny memory stick based MP3 player, and related accessories (I already have a similar bag for my camera).  When my Creative Muvo player's el-cheapo case that came with the player cracked badly and I feared it breaking completely, I wanted a cheap, durable, reasonably sized case.   I really wasn't able to find ANYTHING made for such a player.  Then I looked for small camera bags, figuring if I could pop the earbuds in with the winder and a couple extra batteries, I was set.  

Now this is what I carry my MP3 player in.  It is easy to carry 1 to 5 extra AAA batteries and the player and the earbuds and winder.  The player stays dry, padded, and secure.  The very versatile zipper (two zippered tabs to leave any zipper hole where you want, and as big or small as you want) for the large pouch makes it perfect to let the earbud cord peek out without fear of any rain getting in. 


I think if you have a SMALL digital camera OR a SMALL MP3 player, and care more about functionality, durability, and a VERY reasonable price than the latest fashion fad -- you can't go wrong here. 

The only three (small) drawbacks for tiny MP3 player use I can see are:

1). I used a piece of bubble wrap to pad the player in the large pouch.  It was actually a bit big for the small pouch, and would flop around a lot in the big pouch. 

2). Of course, you can't get to the player controls when it is secured in this case.  This doesn't bother me as I generally just turn it on, adjust the volume to the circumstances, pick the music I want, close the pouch, and enjoy my music.  IF however, you want to fiddle with the player controls a lot, you WON'T like this solution. 

3).  Instead of a custom-made hole for the headphone/earbud cord, you need to use a zipper gap as described above. I see no practical harm, and in fact it makes where the ""virtual hole"" goes extremely versatile.  However, it may be a fashion ""disaster"" (which I couldn't care less about, personally).  "

This product is exactly what is described.  The ""iSkin eVo3 Athletic Protective Case"" has a hard plastic see through cover that fits over the entire front of the iPod.  The silicon cover is soft (and sticky so it prevents sliding - especially if you remove the clip) and is easy to put on.  The case covers the whole ipod except the headphone jack and has a ""flap"" that fits over (and into) the connection on the bottom.  You use the click wheel and the slide on top through the silicon.

It also looks pretty good.

The only thing that takes some getting used to is the silicon over the click wheel.  It, like the click wheel was when I first got the iPod, takes some getting used to.  It's pretty thin and tends to buckle if you push hard.  (Don't worry, though.  It fixes itself when you pick up your finger.)

If you're looking for a good quality, semi cool looking, funcional cover, this is a pretty good choice.

Either way, enjoy and share your music whenever you can!!"

To my amazement they were comfortable. Later that night my step dad came in to put me in my pull up. I surprised him by taking off my clothes and revealing my underwear. He was so proud of me and my decision. Problem with these is that sometimes I wet the bed and they show stains but I keep on wearing them. The briefs gave me the confedence to breakaway from the pull ups and be a real big boy"

Not bad, but a constant, nagging pain sensation that I learned to just live with.  Finally, I saw a podiatrist who referred me to a pedorthist to be fitted with footwear that could alleviate my pain.  I wound up with a pair of Birkenstock sandals and I've never turned back.

They're great.  No more foot pain, period.  I wear dress socks and the sandals to work everyday (in an office environment -- I got flack for that from co-workers, but the needling didn't bother me and management never took me to task, either), to church, everywhere.  I've a different pair of Birkies for the beach and lawn work -- not as comfortable as the suede uppers on these Arizona's.  The mocha suede straps have held up wonderfully despite getting wet and lightly soiled from time to time.

Admittedly, it's a lot of money to spend, but the shoe store my pedorthist works in re-soles the Birkies for about $30, and will replace the cork and sole both for about $50.  The re-soled sandals last about a year, but remember, I wear them daily and I often walk a few miles each day.

In short, these sandals have dramatically improved the quality of my life and foot arthritis is no longer any concern for me.  Not bad for a little more than $100"

Goonan ""www.meaningful-life.us""","Pleasanton, CA","I bought these socks on the strength of the other reviews.  I won't repeat what these reviewers said except to say that I agree they are the best white socks you can get.  However, I will add some additional information that they did not necessarily mention.

These socks are obviously well made and fairly thick.  However, they are not too thick which is a concern that I had.  They are much thicker and softer than Gold Toes Cotton Crew socks, but you must also pay for this i.e. $9.00 vs. $15.00.  On the other hand, I estimate these socks will stand up to laundering better, last much longer and will stay up with repeated washing.

The exact composition of these socks is:  84% combed cotton, 15% stretch nylon and 1% spandex.  The less expensive socks I reference above are 82% combed cotton, 17% stretch nylon and 1% spandex.  One would think this wouldn't make much difference in terms of durability, but there seems to be more weight and material overall in the higher quality socks.

I have also had some experience with the WHITE COTTON CREW socks and while they are absorbent because of the high cotton content, I don't feel they held up to repeated washing well.  I also don't think they are much better than less expensively priced socks by other manufacturers.  However, the WHITE FLUFFIES are a quantum leap up and worth the extra money"

Gross,"Winchester, MA USA","I would never give Gold Toe Cotton Fluffies anything less than 5 stars; they are one of my favorite things, but I want to caution people that the color ""Navy"" is, to my human eyes at least, virtually identical to ""Black.""

I love my socks, but I have a real problem matching them up when I sort my laundry, and it's not as though I am color-blind.  I fear that it will be a challenge to distinguish these from true black socks when they come out of the dryer.

About 25-years-ago, Gold Toe manufactured Cotton Fluffies in a much wider variety of colors.  I would pay a lot of money for a new pair of Kelly Green Cotton Fluffies, should they ever be re-issued.  I think Gold Toe may be missing out on a real opportunity to market their socks in limited edition colors, like VW Beetles or Beanie Babies"

Then I found leatherup jacket and they got good stuff......all the stuffs are good and at very reasonable price. 

The sizing is perfect , the leather is near excellent but not the ROYAL thing.

The ineer lining is very nice and warm.One thing to note if your size is 37-38 or 43-44 then measure like this, for 37-38 dont get 38-42 you will get the 42 size which will be large get 34-36 and you will get 36 which will be alright,and for 43 size order 40-42 -  you get the point.

It is very large. This may be a good thing to some as there is plenty of room for deposit receipts , register etc. For women it really isn't a big problem if they have a pocketbook with ample room. It isn't a ""feminine"" item by any means. It is designed more for men. Though it will take the room of a whole pocket to carry it. Being a woman myself, I really don't mind the fact that it isn't feminine looking. I don't plan on using it for fashion. I just want a checkbook cover that won't fall apart in a years time and one I can keep more than a few checks in. For my needs it is working out fine. I wish it was a tad smaller, but then there wouldn't be all that room. You always have to trade off one thing for another in almost anything you have. All in all this is just what I wanted.  "

I ordered it in body beige, which is plenty light, and does not show through my white dress.  It was a little hard to put on, but that's to be expected with the firm control stuff, also, the bra part didn't want to stay up very well.  I felt like I had to keep tugging it up, but it just felt saggy, it didn't look saggy.  This may be because the back of the unitart is a pretty low V shape to accomadate most back styles of dresses.  I think adding velcro to the bra and the inside of my dress will solve this problem.  Also, the two pieces of boning on the sides poke my waist in rather unnaturally.  Alone it looks kind of funny, but with the dress on you can't tell.  There is a gussett in the crotch to allow for trips to the restroom but I'm not sure how well this will work, as I have not tried it yet.  I'm hoping I won't have to...

Overall the quality is very good for the money and it does a very nice job of shaping and smoothing without showing under a white dress"

To help clarify sizing for people (there have been conflicting reviews here), I ordered a Medium but then returned it for a L.  I will probably get some minor alterations, but I don't blame the company for that...everyone is shaped differently.

I am 6'0"" and weigh 175.  My suit measurements are a 42"" chest, 34"" sleeves, and 32"" pants inseam.  The Medium body fit but the sleeves and pants were too short.

I wish Hane's would make colors in this style, but I find that it's even somewhat difficult to find these white ones.  I can't imagine that they have no market for men that enjoy comfort, would appreciate a variety of tastful colors, but like a normal waist fit.

Regardless of that minor frustration, I highly recommend these.  My husband has never mentioned that they were too loose around the legs, though he does have quite muscular thighs."

I found them to be a larger fit then other Hanes briefs. When buying Hanes briefs I tend to buy a size larger because they fit better and bind less. These briefs don't bind at all. In fact they tend to loosen too much permiting your baggage from exiting through the leg holes.  At the end of the day they become uncomfortable

The method used to keep the fishnet 'down' (towards your hand) is a single clothen loop that goes around your middle finger, if you keep the fishnet pulled down far enough this is fine and comfortable, but if you allow the 'bottom' of the lower part of fishnet, near the heal of your hand, to slip upward to your wrist, this will pull on that loop and likely leave a deep mark in your finger for about 10-15 minutes after taking off the fishnets.

This is a great suit for that. The fit is a bit skimpy around the sides under the arm--if you're accustomed to buying a sport suit a little tight, maybe just go one size down, not two. If you have doubts, get your regular size and you'll be fine.

Bruguier,"Cholula, Puebla, MX","I purchased the Boston Clog in the summer of 2000, have worn it every year since then, and am happy to report that it is still the most comfortable shoe I possess.  Since many of the other reviews here have praised its comfort, I will briefly pass over a few of the problems that will probably occur over long-term wear.

First, after about a year of wear, the outsole began to detach itself from the rest of the clog.  This was easily fixed with some shoe glue that I purchased at a shoe store.  Since applying it in 2001 or so, I have not had any further problems with the outsole coming off.

Second, as mentioned in one review, the part of the outsole where your foot hits the ground most often will wear out fastest. This is to be expected.  Nevertheless, after close to seven year's worth of wear, the outsole is still holding up quite well, the heel being the only place where there is no grip pattern left.  Still, plenty of outsole remains.

Finally, about a year ago the leather lining of the footbed started to detach itself from the cork underneath the heel.  Again, any good adhesive will solve the problem.  This time I used super glue--problem solved.  

Overall, the leather reflects seven year's worth of use, but it is still holding up very well, both on the footbed, and on the entire upper part.  All things considered, I have worn a lot of shoes in the past seven years, many of them overpriced European brands fabled for comfort (Ecco, Camper, Clarks) but the Boston Clog has outlasted all of them in terms of durability and comfort.  I highly recommend this quality shoe"

I wore them as many places as I could because of the comfort, and  I simply refused to change shoes.  The only thing with that is the shoe ran over quicker than I anticipated so I had to buy three more pair. The heel does not last as long as a walking or running shoe from esprit --- that is the only draw back.

Since the inside of the shoe molds to your feet, it will reflect your shoe size if you lose or gain too much weight.  When I lost weight after having my baby, I lost weight in my feet as well and I had to start wearing bulky soxs with my berks instead of stocking.

When I first tried on my berks, they were a little tight and slightly uncomfortable but after walking around in them for about two days it loosen up and molded to my feet, -----  once that happened they were very comfortable from then on.

Another thing I love about it my sister cannot borrow my berks because she says they don't fit her right and they are uncomfortable. We wear the same size shoe give or take a few minor width inches here and there, but because the berks are molded to my feet imprint and my walking pattern she can't wear them comfortable.

You'll notice that your foot gets slightly wider behind the metatarsal heads and then narrows again in both directions (phalangead AND calcad, as podiatrists might say). The Boston is so expertly crafted--and so balanced for an anatomically perfect foot--that the material will stretch just wide enough to admit those protuberant metatarsal heads, then spring back just tight enough to hold them in place. It was fun mesmerizing Eytan: he was so arrogant"

I love high heel shoes. I have a collection of them. My husband, through surfing the internet for Valentine's Day found the site. 

What is exciting about the whole thing is I am pretty sure no one will have the same shoes in Ottawa!!!

Not having half sizes, we ordered size 7. They were too small so we reordered size 8. We will know for next time.

Spike Angel company is very professional and easy to deal with. They exchanged the shoes for the right size in no time"

As a long time 505 guy, I thought their must be a lower line of jeans of Levi's that they are releasing to big chain stores, saving their Regular Levi Name for Department stores.  Well, finally I broke down to look at a pair of these jeans when I say they were on sale. I was astonished, they are exactly the same jean, for an average of $10 less.  Look closely, the stitching is the same, even the position of the inside labels. The buttons and rivits are the same as well.  The main difference is that the Back Pockets don't have that little red Levi tag, and the ""V"" shaped decorative detail stich. Otherwise these are the same jeans. They fit just as well, and I think even better, but that may be because my wallet is a bit fuller fit after buying these. After 15 years of 505's, I have found a new favorite.  Seriously, check these out, you wont be dissapointed.  Even better, they do have a kids line, so for your growing kids you can get the same levi quality for less, nice when they grow out of jeans so fast.  If you are worried about where they are manufactured, I can tell you the last 20 pairs of Levi's I have had have been made in either mexico, Columbia, or somewhere in asia, so these being made in egypt is not a big deal, at least they grow cotton their.
Note: button fly 501 people, they do not have a line of Signature button flys, so you have to stick to regular levi's. Probably a smart marketing move, but these genes suprised me, and Levi's may suprise again"

The fit of the regular Levi's Strauss Signature is similar if not identical to the fit of the zipper fly 505, Levi Strauss's most popular model of blue jeans. The main difference is that there is less sewing detail on the rear pockets and on the side just below the waist, and no red tab on the rear pocket.  The finishes are mainstream stonewash in light, medium and dark.  If you can live with this limited choice of finishes you can save a few bucks by buying the Levi Strauss Signature jeans.

Many people do not know the full history of these Italian leather babies, but those who do know are of the upper echelon. The Ellesse name is based on the initials, L.S., of its founder, Leonardo Servadio, an Italian tailor with an innovative approach to styling and manufacture. In 1959, Servadio created a revolutionary stretch ski pant which established Ellesse among the elite alpine social circles, making it the ultimate aspirational brand.

The immense success of Ellesse in winter sports clothing provided a perfect passport to expand the brand and transfer the design philosophy into the equally prestigious world of tennis. In 1976, Servadio seized the opportunity to take the brand onto a worldwide stage and embarked on an aggressive sponsorship programme signing tennis legends such as Boris Becker, Chris Evert Lloyd and Guillermo Vilas.

Ellesse became synonymous with tennis and skiing and as a testimony to the success of Ellesse in these highly competitive fields, the Ellesse logo, consisting of half a tennis ball combined with 2 ski tips, surmounting the company name, was created.

I must also warn that there are a few pairs in this particular line that have a minor defect, in which there is one shoe where the sole comes loose. This can be fixed with a little rubber cement, but if you don't want to be bothered, just send it back and have it easily exchanged, with the shipping costs reimbursed back to you. Even with that small hassle, you can't beat the sharply reduced price featured here!

My favorite pick is the White/Tan/Brown. Just be sure to keep the laces clean"

One complaint I might have is that the edges are finished with stitching that feels rough to the touch.  Also, I would have liked to have seen a few more inches of length.  But it's certainly long enough to use.

Made from high-quality materials, it is the height of performance and fit.  The smaller waistband allows for greater movement and a less restrictive fit especially if you're doing any kind of cardio exercise like running, biking or on the eliptical machine.  The contoured pouch is made of a blended fabric that allows for maximum moisture absorption and breatheability, while cupping and supporting you.  The leg straps are a comfortable width that don't roll or cut under your cheeks.  My only complaint is that I wish they would come out with a black version like they did with their standard Jock.

Get rid of your old Jock and buy a bunch of these - I did!  Of course look around, the jocks here on Amazon seem to be a bit pricy, this $6.95 jock I found at a local sporting goods store for $3.99, or a 2-pack for $7.50"

I've worn it as regular underwear and found that the comfort level & support is excellent.  Normally I like to wear the Jockey Next-to-Nothing thongs, but need more ball support when I'm jogging on the treadmill.  The front pouch conforms to your bulge perfectly and has the right amount of fabric to completely cover & cup your balls, unlike other thongs and jocks on the market that leave some uncovered space.

I love the textured look and feel of the ribbed mesh pouch while the support is consistent and comfortable.  The thin colored waistband offers a great look when compared to the excessively wide waistbands of other jocks.  The straps that go around your cheeks give you the same feel as other jocks.  Just keep in mind that the straps of a jock offer a different feel from that of thong-type underwear, so it may take a little getting used to if you're not accustomed to wearing a jockstrap.  All in all, this jockstrap by Bike offers the most when it comes to support, look and feel."

But Price Lowered After Ordering,"November 30, 2006",Queensporsche,"Seattle, Washington","I am a larger guy and needed a light windbreaker-type jacket with a hood that would also keep the rain off my head (that's Seattle for ya).  Since none of the local stores had these in stock I searched Amazon and found this one.  The jacket is of excellent quality and is better than I expected it to be.  It breaks the wind extremely well, and if you really need to bundle up there are velcro strips on the sleeve openings, draw strings around the waist and snaps that go over the zipper.  All in all this is an excellent wind breaker jacket.  It won't keep you warm in very cold weather, but it is one of the best light jackets I've ever owned.  

When I placed my order on November 16, 2006 I chose 'standard shipping' and was promised a shipping date of Nov. 20 to Nov. 27.  I received the item on Nov. 27.  I can't say for sure whether I would have received it sooner had Thanksgiving day not fallen within that week, so I won't really complain about the receiving date.  

My COMPLAINT with the order, however, is this:  From the time I placed my order to the time I received the jacket, the advertised sale price DROPPED by 25 percent, $10.00.  I ordered the jacket and paid $39.95 but by the time I got it, the price was $29.99.  This didn't seem right to me.  I've written to Turfer for a resolution but have not yet received one.  If this is resolved favorably, I'll edit this review.  

Except for the price dispute, I highly recommend this jacket if you need a light windbreaker type jacket.  It will serve you very well.  Just make sure that you get the right price!! 

EDIT:  Still no response from Turfer on the price change, but Amazon's stated policy is that prices and availability may change without notice, so I guess it's buyer beware.  I notice that as of today the price on this item is still $29.99.  I've been using it for 2 months now and I must say it's a fantastic lightweight jacket.  I want to buy another one but I'm afraid the second I order it the price will drop to $19.99!!!"

But I didn't want to go all out and get those tiny suits that Olympic swimmers and Europeans wear so this was a nice compromise.

Remember that it's a snug, tight suit so if you normally wear a Medium pair of surfing trunks, you'll want a Large size here cause it will feel uncomfortably tight and make you feel VERY self-conscious when you step out of the changing room.

Material is very good.  It stretches well, dries quickly.  The elastic in the waistband, however, is not attached so everytime you take off the suit, the waistband elastic gets all twisted around.  It's not difficulat to manually twist 'em back into shape --but it's still annoying.

Because it's so snug, there are no pockets of any kind and no place to put your locker key.

Overall, it's a good product.  But you better not be self-conscious about your body --this is the man's equivalent of a thong bikini (considering how modest men's --at least American men's-- swimwear has become).  I felt very self-conscious at first but since I only wore them to the gym to swim laps, I didn't care so much about how I looked and I really appreciated the fact that this was comfortable to swim in.  But now, after a year of dedicated working out, I'm starting to look GOOD and these swimtrunks really accentuate the broad shoulders and tight abs.  I even wear them around the house cause it drives my wife nuts (in a good way).  And now that James Bond wore something like these in Casino Royale, it won't be too weird for me to wear this to the beach this summer"

They look fun too (I got the blue ones). 

They feel comfortable enough to walk for a couple of hours (they have light cushioning, they are somehow stable), but becareful during those hot days because you can get blisters on your feet since they are not leather. 

Size, I'm 7.5 in sandals and 8 in boots. In these shoes I have to get an 8 so they fit my wide feet, and they are just fine. They make me look really tall, and yet the are more comfortable than other high heel shoes. I like that. It is true that after a while of walking with them your feet can hurt on the front.

Very comfortable to run in, providing stable footing and extreme cushioning.  They seem to be saving me from some of the normal knee and back pain I get running in my 4 yr old NB's.  Would be great for cross country, because the treads are somewhat knobby. Not too knobby to use on the treadmill so I'd have to say they are a great all around running shoe and are A+ for outdoors/x-country or winter running.  The goretex weather proofing didn't make my feet too hot.  Probably an overkill if you don't plan to use them for running, the knobby tread can make you trip if you're just walking, etc.  I haven't used them in bad weather but I would imagine they would be great for running in rain/snow/ice conditions.

One ill point is that the pants seem to have been cut a little off.  When sewed together they had to have been forced on one pant leg.  This forced sewing cause the pant leg on one side between the legs to have a permanent twist.   When ironing you have to work around this so as not to cause a ironed wrinkle.
Otherwise:  Good color,  the twist does not seem to bother my son.   
Other draw back is:  There are never enough of my sons size for order and companies do not provide a more varied color range.  Surely,  there can be more colors for the guys over 42 inch waist.   "

Sherwin,"Brewster, New York United States","Amazon notes that these socks are ""only made from the finest yarns."" They mean it, too! These socks keep your feet warm; and they are very well made and last forever. These athletic crew socks can be worn for athletic activities but of course they could be worn for everyday routine use as well. In addition, they are made from 85% Gold Toe's ""Ultrabrite"" acrylic and 15% stretch nylon. Amazon states that the acrylic gives these socks ""wickability"" but this word may be a typographical error; I could not find an entry for the word ""wickability"" in the dictionary. The price is right, too. 

These crew length socks also fit any shoe size between 7 and 12; therefore it is--almost--one size fits all. The reinforced heel and toe makes them last longer and they still feel very comfortable on my feet. The sock itself comes in white; but the toe area is literally made from gold colored fibers. 

I would not dry these socks at high temperatures. This could result in the sock becoming too loose on your foot. Eventually they could ""bunch up"" when you wear them and that's very uncomfortable. Dry these fine socks at a lower temperature. Then they will remain just as comfortable as ever. I know mine do!

Overall, you can't go wrong buying these socks. They keep your feet extra warm during colder weather. They are manufactured so well that you definitely get more than your money's worth. A good deal!

The swim suites being made of very soft and elastic fabric, it does not cause the itchiness on your waste, hips, and crotch, which usually happens when you put on small Speedos like this. The suits actually have only one inch cloth on the sides, you may move your legs in the water very easily, and it makes your swim performance far better than the other Speedos. Another good feature of this suit is that there are many variation of color. I own white, black and dark blue one. I personally do not recommend the one in white and very light color, since it become absolutely see-through when wet.

I know there is one big concern when men wearing this suite. Here is my comment to someone who does not have confidence to wear them in swimming pool: To be frank, my friends told me that the suits are little revealing since those have high-leg cut and made of thin fabric. In fact, even in the darker colors, shape of your""manhood"" will be somewhat revealed especially when wet in these suits. (But not see-through) However, don't you think it always happens when you are in any Speedos as long you have the ""organ?"" it is absolutely more strange if that part was completely flat. In addition, any swimming suits have more or less this feature. If you are a person who thinks that is unfavorable, you may want to stop swimming in pool and do the other work outs. In other words, people might see you package occasionally since it has high leg cut and adhere to your body. However who cares, stares, and makes fun of it all the time when you are in swimming pool? The suites cover only essential part because it was made to swim fast, but absolutely not to reveal your manhood and pull attention from others. Don't you agree?

 I recommend you to try it at least once if you are swimmers who seriously want to swim fast. The price being around $20, it is affordable as the second swim ware. I realized that the actual size of the waist of this suite might be a little bigger than the jeans or pants. Therefore, you will feel more comfortable if you buy a one size smaller. Like myself, I usually ware jeans or pants in the size of 29. Therefore I chose 28 and perfectly fit me. The fabric being elastic, it stretches a bit. However, if you worry about the size, just buy the exact size. I love this suit and ware it all at least once a week. As other people wrote previously, the color fades relatively fast in pool water. Therefore, I would suggest you buy two pairs and wear it in turns. "

Rogers ""Avid swimmer""",Florida,"I am a serious swimmer, and I am a great believer in ""Less is Best!"" I know that the Speedo Fastskin full body suit creates an artificial surface that may be faster than bare skin alone, but when the chips are down for the Big Meet, I'll shave down and really zip along with only minimal coverage. Body hair is really a drag. So this Speedo, along with similar low-rider briefs are my favorites.
Please, guys, if you don't have the proper build or are obese and/or have a paunch, DO NOT WEAR THIS or anything else resembling this Speedo!!
Your goal should be to work on your physique so you can safely look great in this wonderful Speedo.
However, if you are in decent condition, then go for it and be proud to show off your body! People will naturally look at you! Women will admire your looks and men will be envious! So there you have it"

Otherwise it is great for swimming and sunning, it offers minimal coverage without being obscene. If if wasn't for the fact that this suit wear out so easily if you don't take care of it, it would be perfect."

The only downside is getting the license out of it is sort of difficult because the slot is tight but I'm sure it will loosen up over time.  Also, because the wallet is sleek, if I didn't have a zippered pocketbook, I'd be afraid it would slip out inadvertently so this may be a consideration for you."

I went searching for a new one that would replace it.  Wallets are one of those items that has to be just right.  When I read the description, I thought this one would be a pretty good replacement, and it has been, for the most part.  The zipper and zipper pull seem nice and strong.  When you open it, there is a card section with room for 9 credit cards but I doubled some up, and it does work to have 2 per slot.  There is a place under the credit card slots to put receipts or other cards.  The other half of the wallet has one zippered pocket (where I keep money) and then slots on either side for receipts, as well as a covered checkbook holder.  All-in-all this one was not as big as my old wallet, and I did have to remove some items before it would close (getting a new wallet is always a good time to clean out all the stuff you don't need anyway!). However, the price was right and the colors offered (I got the lime green) are cute and fashion-forward"

I will buy another couple pairs - but not soon, as I don't think these are going to wear out for a good long time. My unstinting support, wholehearted recommendation, and so forth. Buy these trousers. Sure they may cost a smidge more than, I duno Dockers.

I have put these things to the test in EXTENDED hiking chores and come in at day's end with sore back, legs, etc - but feet feeling fine and ready for more.  Sounds like baloney but it's not.

I cannot overstate how pleased I have been with mine.  Great traction and they show essentially no wear thus far.  It scares me to think what it will take to wear these things out.  I didn't buy them for looks, but I've had several compliments on them.

Some additional observations -- There is essentially no break in period.  You can hit it hard with them right out of the box and they'll treat your feet well.  Although a slip-on, due to their substantial construction, they do not pull on all that easily.  You have to use the handy heel tab provided and give a pretty good tug.

As they look kind of like a running shoe (the ""chameleon effect"" again) I gave them a go on a two mile jog.  BIG MISTAKE.  I might as well have been wearing steel-toe engineer boots.  These things have a substantial heel element concealed in the shoe and they felt like they weighed a ton.  They are not cross-trainers and are not suited as running shoe.  

I fully recommend these for situations where one is on their feet all day and a casual/sports appearing shoe is appropriate.  Worth the price"

I figured that I'd get these, and they'd be a regular dress-sock length and go to just above the curve of the calf.

But, um, no.  The tops of the socks actually come right up to my knee, stopping just shy of bunching up at the joint.  On the one hand, no force on this earth could make these socks sag, which is good; on the other hand, they're a minor pain to get on.  I actually had to get hosiery advice from my wife (roll the top down, put your foot into the bottom part, and then unroll the sock up your leg), which is disturbing.

More disturbing is feeling like I should be donning a tunic and heading off to a Ren Faire.  But if you can get past the oddness, well, you're sure as heck not going to have baggy socks"

Sizing Help:

To help clarify sizing for people (there have been conflicting reviews here), I ordered a Medium but then returned it for a L.  I will probably get some minor alterations, but I don't blame the company for that...everyone is shaped differently.

I am 6'0"" and weigh 175.  My suit measurements are a 42"" chest, 34"" sleeves, and 32"" pants inseam.  The Medium body fit but the sleeves and pants were too short.  The Large was the best fit overall, although roomier around the chest than I would prefer.  But if you are my size the Large is your best option."

I overheard him telling one of his friends about them, which is a rarety to hear men talking about shoes in this house.  He especially likes how the sole wrapes up along the side of the shoe.  It makes him more comfortable when he wears them outside to get the mail, the paper, etc. because he doesn't have to worry about the side of the slipper getting wet by dew on the grass or the small puddles left by the sprinklers.

They appear to be very well made and durable, he hasn't had them long enough to know if they really are but they seem to be.  We live in Florida so it is difficult to find slippers that can be worn year round and the flannel lining in these keeps your feet warm in cool weather and not too hot in warm weather.  

One thing about these though is we had to return the first pair because they were a little snug on his feet.  According to him, because of the rubber sole wrapping up along the side prevented them from giving so they were a little tight.  We had to go a size larger than he usually wears.  When he got the larger pair, he was and continues to be a happy camper"

I bought it primarily for my 15"" notebook computer. I was wary about this bag because it doesn't have padding/rigid structure to protect the computer but I rarely lug my computer around outside of going to the airport, to and from the car, to a friend's house, etc. This bag is perfect for short distances where I don't have to stand idle longer than 30 minutes (the strap isn't comfortable with a heavy load). But like I say, I'm not walking around with a heavy load for very long. 

Now! For the most awesome feature, once I'm in my hotel and my computer is on the desk where it will stay until time to go back to the airport, I have a stylish and simple all purpose canvas bag to put my book, scarf, notebook, or whatever. Try carrying around a typical laptop bag without looking like the laptop guy. Now that I have one, the benefits of having a slim multi-purpose bag far outweigh my desire for padding.

This bag fits the bill for dual purposes. If you carry around your computer ALL the time you may want consider buying something with padding on the bottom and some rigidity. I wouldn't ever want to drop the bag with my notebook in it or I might need a new PC. 

But come on! Sub-$20 bucks!!! Great Deal."

First off, they don't fit like the old CK crew necks... they are, in fact, shorter and the waist is wider. The length isn't bad- it's the waist width that is too large and makes the shirt ill-fitting. (I have an average body-type) After just a few washings, some of the stitching started coming undone, and there were loose strands on the inner parts of the shirts. I'm continually trimming these loose ends. Although that didn't affect the way these shirts fit, I would expect better stitching from CK. I do wear the shirts under sweaters or jackets, but I feel awkward wearing them on their own as outerwear due to the fit. I don't recommend these shirts.

I would recommend to anyone looking for a wallet to hold many cards whether they are credit cards, id cards, insurance cards, etc"

It's very soft and buttery, lightweight, and long.  The drape is incredible.  You can wear it just around your neck or drape it over your head first and it looks stunning.

Initially, I got the winter lilac color, which is actually magenta.  Very pretty color.  I loved it so much, I bought the ivory, black, and cassis (a dark burgundy).  This was a good thing, because my six-year-old daughter cabbaged onto the first one.  Imagine that: A scarf a child actually *wants* to wear.  I love this scarf so much, I'm going to buy the other colors I don't have yet.

We had a very cold, windy winter this year, and I wore one of these scarves every day.  They kept me warm without being oppressively heavy.  They also roll up into almost no space at all, so they're ideal for travel or having in your bag ""just in case.""

The scarf is 100% acrylic, and the one drawback is that it's dry-clean only.  I suspect handwashing would be okay, though.  Even if you have to baby it a bit, it's worth it for the exquisite texture.

I highly recommend this scarf.   "

I bought a pack recently and was dismayed to discover that Jockey has added a very overwhelming ""baby-powder"" scent to the product (what's the point of 100% cotton when you add chemicals to the fabric?).  Repeated washings have not removed the smell.  I will have to dispose of the underwear.  I am extremely allergic to anything perfumed or scented.

Williams,"Los Angeles, CA","I just bought these for a song on Amazon. Now, I wear an 11 narrow so I only paid 59 bucks for these and this fact does affect my review.

I sold shoes for several years and learned what good shoes are and where they come from. Generally, Italian shoes are a safe bet but I tend to buy Swedish, Spanish or Brazilian because of the uniform quality. Let me tell you, Brazilian leather is some of the finest and rivals Spanish leather.

These shoes arrived and I wore them to work the next day.  I chose the CHILI color which didn't disappoint right out of the box. Mimimal soreness which is a good sign and also very light creasing on the uppers which made me happy. 

 A minor gripe which is not aimed solely at Bostonian but does anyone welt their shoes anymore? Welting is usually the surest sign of quality and easy to discern. Welting is simply sewing through the sole of the shoe. It is faked often so beware of rubber welting.

The heel is stacked on this shoe and  it seems a good laminate job. Stacking adds stability and oomph to a heel so always go for it when you can.

The leathers on this shoe are very good for the price and display a nice patina and richness. Not quite top notch shoe leather but above-average for this range. 

The stitching is very nice with no defects on either shoe.

The overall profile of this shoe is handsome and sleek -- just the way I like my oxfords. The finish is rich and deep. I received several compliments on them around the office which always helps!

All in all, I have more expensive brown oxfords in my closet but these babies are just as comfortable and attractive not to mention cheaper. A good solid work shoe"

I do some international travel and a travel wallet becomes very much necessary to carry my passport, air tickets, itinerary ...

Why would I reccomend this travel wallet
 * Size - Many of the travel wallets in the market do not completely fit in a air ticket- this one does - withouth folding the air tickets/boarding pass.
 * Zippers - The previous travels wallets that I owned did not have any zippers, I have had incidence where my boarding pass had falled off and I did not even realize.  Zippers are a must when you are carrying documents.  Ofcourse it does make it painful to open them everytime.  But hey, which one would you prefer - losing your documents are a fews seconds to open the zippers
  * PVC backing - The wallet comes with a firm PVC backing, so that it does not bend easily and wrinkle you documents
  * Good looks and styling - With a swiss army logo and good quality material - people are sure to notice what you are carrying.  The wallet does not have to be made in leather, still its looks are very decent.

Where the travel wallet loses a star ?  I wish if there was another dividing compartment in the wallet"

The main difference is the stitching on the pouch and the cut.

This coutour pouch brief is meant to (like most 2(x)ist underwear), show off your male assets.  I think this one does that effectively by using the pouch and the dramatic contrast lines.  I ordered the black and white to make a real impact, and trust me - it does.

The fit is great, there is enough room for everything and although it is cotton, it stretches and shapes to my body just as well as the synthetic materials on the 2(x)ist X-Factor Countour Pouch Brief 7403 do (see my review on that product page as well).  I would suggest that brief as well, but you will lose out on the sexy contrast lines.

If you seem to like this brief, may I suggest you shake things up a little a consider ordering the 2(x)ist Contrast No-Show Trunk 3133C?  The contour lines around the pouch have the effect of shining a spotlight on your assets, while the lower rise means you can wear some of your more fashionable jeans with them.

I ordered the 3133C also and will review it as soon as it arrives"

Ariel Gown Set: Apparel,apparel,,4.0,Nightgown is fine; accessories have problems,"March 29, 2007","Ben C. Taylor ""Horticountant""","Provo, Utah","We ordered the nightgown in a size 6 for my 4 1/2 year old daughter.  She's a bit on the tall side and we wanted the nightgown to last a while.  The nightgown itself has no problems - the contstruction seems sturdy, no visible flaws, and good printing, even if it is a little on the darker side.  And as she claims ""Ariel is my favorite princess"", so there was no way it wasn't going to be a hit with her.

The slippers that came with the nightgown were too small for a size 6.  They didn't even fit my three year old who wears a size 8.  I'm guessing these slippers are around a size 6.  I would have thought that they would have sized the slippers to the size of the nightgown, but now I suspect they make them ""one size fits all"" (aka ""one size too small"").  Besides being too small, there is nothing to pull up over the heel, so they constantly slip off the foot.  They were discarded after 15 minutes when my two daughters realized they looked like more fun than they actually were.

The tiarra is obviously cheaply made.  We weren't expecting any more than that.  My 4 1/2 year old left it on the ground the first evening she got it and accidentally stepped on it breaking it cleanly in half.  Honestly, I was relieved I could get rid of it that quickly.

I'm giving the product 4 stars because what we were really buying was the nightgown.  The lack of 5 stars is due to the poor construction and sizing of the slippers - they could have done a better job.  The tiarra is a non-issue to us"

Payne,"Fargo, ND","Well, after using my Creative Zen naked, with no covering at all; with the other popular leather cover; and with this sillicon cover/package, I can honestly say that, considering the price and what's included in this package, this is, by far, the best route to go when picking a case for your own Zen. 

The other main case, the leather one, looks nice, but for around $30, I expect a little more functionality. This cover is a few dollars cheaper, and for that, I would only expect a cover, as is included with the leather one. But, when you take into account the screen protector that's included (and which costs $15 by itself from other places), the stand on the back (which is, granted, mildly weak, but look at what it's holding up....if you watch your share of videos and movies on your Zen, as I do, the back-stand comes in very handy), and the other things, I would expect it to be more. So, don't let the cheap price deter you from getting this one, as it almost did me, thinking that it's poor quality. The sillicon tends to attract dust and lint, but it wipes or blows away easily, and is, really, the only thing that comes close to a downside. 

Get this case. You won't regret it"

Like the photo implies, and like most 2(x)ist men's products, this underwear is sexy, comfortable, flattering and made of quality materials.

What drew me to this particular pair was the bold graphic statement it makes with the contrast, specifically around the pouch area.  Believe me, it is truly a pouch.  A big one.  Its actually just the right size for me, and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it/filling it.  The contrast lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas, so its really nice.

Of course, the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this ""no-show.""  I had no problem with this being no show, wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it.  Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants :)

For me, this trunk was not uncomfortable, given its diminished size and intent to be no-show.  Granted, in those moments of excitement, things do get a little more - eh, crowded.  But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear.  I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief/boxerbrief/trunk.

This pair is made of 100% cotton, so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the X-Factor line may enjoy this feature.  My only complaint is that the leg openings (also contrast) do not ""cling"" to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon, etc.  But that is just minor.

The waistband is, as always, a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height, in keeping with the no-show design.

I cannot reccommend this trunk enough, and within hours, it became my favorite 2(x)ist product in my collection"

The wallet has 15 credit card slots (and you can carry more if you double up), and a window for your driver's license conveniently located on the checkbook flap. The zippered compartment is wide, and has two big open pockets for your bills, and papers; a credit card holder(that's part of the 15 counted) and a center zippered compartment. I am on my second Big Fat Wallet. It is the only wallet that fits all my stuff. I can go to the ATM and immediately put my cash in this wallet and zipper it up. I don't have to fumble trying to stuff it into slim pockets like other wallets I have owned. The new edition (which is the one pictured here) has an extra fastener so it can accomodate your wallet's growth, and stay closed. It also has a pocket under the front flap.  The only complaint is that the ID window that you could pull out out from the back pocket and then have it ""pop"" back doesn't do that anymore. Instead of a elastic band that attached the window to the wallet, Mundi substituted a plastic fastner..like the kind that stores use to hang price tags on clothes. All in all, for a leather wallet at this low price, you can't go wrong. Yes, the leather isn't glove soft or for that matter a high quality leather, but I'd rather not have a flashy expensive wallet.

Everything works. The leather is good quality - looks like calf. It is comfortable to wear on the back but also has a top strap to carry in one hand. That strap and the part of the armband that adjusts are an ordinary sort of nylon strap. I would have preferred all leather, but for this price (under $30) it is a quibbling point. Inside are places for your wallet, cell, PDA, lipstick, etc. 

On a brief shopping sortie, it may carry home all your purchases (of small things) and make you look good while doing it. After all, most people use those cheap nylon backpacks with the garish colors (or black, Yuk!) so you will stand out as having some class.

Note that it is best to think of this as the equivalent of a large handbag rather than a backpack large enough for an extended camping trip. Look closely at the description of the dimentions. You don't want to be like another reviewer who 'thought it would be bigger.'

Sherwin,"Brewster, New York United States","Gold Toe makes an excellent sock and their ""Men's Canterbury Dress Sock"" is no exception. The socks are remarkably comfortable. They are not thick; and although they are a bit thinner than other Gold Toe socks they will still withstand lots of wear. They almost never ""bunch up"" inside my shoes as I walk around and they are very much worth the price. They last longer so the long life of these socks justifies the slightly higher price.

I also like the design of the toe section actually being gold colored fabric. Amazon points out that these socks come in your choice of four different colors: black, navy blue, grey marl and brown. The safest, most conservative choice for the corporate office is the black color; but the other colors come in handy too depending on your work/play ""dress code.""

These socks can easily be washed in any washer or dryer--but I would heed the manufacturer's warning about not drying them at a high temperature. High temperatures in the clothes dryer cause the sock to wear out faster. The stretch nylon will stretch even more; and then these socks will become just too loose on your feet.

Please note that these are crew length socks. They will not come up your leg to the degree that some other socks will. You may consider them to be ""too short."" On the other hand, the socks also fit shoe sizes 7 through 12 so it's almost one size fits all. 

Overall, Gold Toe is the brand to buy if you want good quality, long lasting socks. The ""Canterbury Dress Socks"" for men match any attire and they can even be worn in bed on those really cold nights to keep your feet warm! 

Highly recommended! May you wear them in good health!     SMILE"

The inside is lined with a terry-like material -- an improvement, I think, if it holds up to wear. The colored stripe around the outside of the bottom is gone.

It effectively cleans water of microbiological contaminants (including viruses) through a layered filtration system and iodine-releasing resin (and among the only EPA certified bottles to do it). It is not heavy and leaves the water with a slight iodine taste (much more subtle than using iodine tablets). Each filtration system, which screws into the inside of the water bottle, lasts about 26 gallons (about 100 liters) after which you have to replace it, costing about US$22. 

I have been using the bottle in rural peru and have had no problems. I would recommend this product for anyone venturing into areas with unknown water sanitation, all you need is the bottle and a puddle, stream, river, etc. I don't know its results against pesticides, arsenic, lead, etc. but for short term use this is a great product"

It seems better made than most.  In particular, the belt buckle seems of a higher quality than most, and that's been the point of failure of two of my previous packs.  (I wish I could find one with a metal buckle.)

There are two changes I would make to this design.  First, the side pockets are too small because they join the main part of the pack in a single seam.  The front panel of the side pocket needs to join the main front panel of the pack in a second seam maybe 3/8"" farther forward.  This would make the side pockets much larger and more useful.

Besides that, I note that there is only a single seam joining the belt to the pack.  Time will tell, but I suspect this may become a failure point.  A second or even third row of stitching here would make me feel more confident.

All that said, it seems like a very good pack -- the zippers and pulls are of high quality, the pockets are all lined, there are plenty of pockets including two security pockets for money and other small valuables -- and I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could -- just not 5 :-"

This was just what I wanted; a good quality messenger style bag that was neither too young nor too old for an almost 30 male.  He loves it and carries his laptop in to daily.  My only concern is that the shoulder strap is thinner than I would have prefered, but so far it is holding up to the job just fine.  There are several pockets inside so it can hold quite a bit, and the phone pocket on the side he chooses to use for his IPod! "

Brafford,CA,"I'm very happy and impressed.  My last briefcase was stolen (along with everything in it), so I decided to make the best of it and treat myself to a bag I actually liked.  Looked at some very pricey options at local stores and couldn't find anything with the style I was looking for.  

Took the risk and bought this over the internet (for significantly less $ than the others I was considering) and I am extremely happy with it.  

The case, even when full is not bulky, but stores a surprising amount.  There are open slots that hold both my notebook and my organizer, a zippered section for my files, two flat zippered sections for miscelanious papers, two 1/2 size pockets for holding my camera and a newspaper perfectly, slots for business cards and a pen organizer.  

Quality is great, thick leather, nice stitching.  My only minor complaint is the latches are magnetic.  I prefer the physical catch type as they are a little easier to latch without looking. 

I actually took some brown shoe polish to it right away to give it more of an aged patina and love it.  I also cut off the stupid cell-phone holder because I thought it was ugly, bulky, and I would never use it even if my phone fit.  

Overall I'm extremely happy with both the David King bag and Luggagepoint's service.  I would gladly buy from them again"

The classes are held in a room with hardwood floors like you find on a basketball court.  Since I use their mats -- and so do many other bare-footed people whose hygiene may be questionable -- I choose to wear socks.  Also the room is kept very air-conditioned making bear feet uncomfortable for that reason.

I was wearing regular cotton ankle socks at first, but some of our poses result in our standing directly on the floor rather than on the mat.  I found I was nervous about slipping on the slick floor, so I started looking for slipper socks with tread on the bottoms.  Oddly, I couldn't find any except very expensive ones designed for geriatric customers.

Then I found these.  I did think they were on the expensive side, which is why only 4 stars.  I do love them though.  They're cozy and they help me keep from slipping in class.  Two thumbs up"

It can be as challenging the quest as the quest for the Holy Grail, if not more so.  I mean, with the Grail, you don't have to worry about sizing.  I hesitated to order this bra for a long time, as it appears to be pretty ugly in the photo displayed here, but I am pleased to say that in person, it's actually rather pretty.  However, be aware that there are 4 hooks in the back, so forget about your amour quickly unclasping it in during a moment of passion.  These hooks and the stretchy, sheer fabric provide substantial support though, and the wide straps are comfortable and won't leave whiplash marks upon the shoulders.  Unfortunately, the bra is cut rather narrow at the upper sides, heading towards the underarms.  Depending on your build, this can mean that the sides of your breasts will squish out, which is unattractive and indicative of a poor fit, so ordering a larger cup size than normal might be necessary"

But nice and comfortable and well-broken in.  While much negative commentary concerning Levi Strauss's move away from domestic manufacturing has focused on the button-fly 501s, the bigger problem I have seen is with the old 1970's standby, the 505, which has a zipper as opposed to button fly. The variability on sizing and sew quality with the 505s is an issue if you are going to buy them online or mail order. The 501 are easier to buy online or by mail order because the sizing is much less critical on the waist, which is the so-called ""anti-fit"" waist, meaning there is no curve to the rise (the distance between the crotch and the top of the waist), because the original 501s were merely cut down bib overalls which were made to hang, rather than be fitted to the waist. The biggest problem I have noted on the 505's is the variability in size in the thigh area, meaning that some fit baggy and some seem rather tight, even though they are theoretically the same size of a label. The 501s are pretty safe as far as sizing. "

I used to wear Nike, until I read in Runner's World Magazine that the ASICS GT-1100 was the Editor's Choice for best overall running shoe, so I thought, why not? In the past I've dealt with shin splints, knee pain and plantar fasciitis(a.k.a. really sore feet), but my ASICS 1100s kept me healthy and comfortable, and relatively stylish. I've been a committed Asics devotee since.

I own ASICS Kayano running shoes, which cost $135 - considerably more than the GT series - and truthfully, I find no difference between the two except for the price. Also, there is not much difference within the GT series. I've owned GT-1100, GT-1120, GT-2110 and GT-2120 - all are superior. So, find the style and color to suit your budget - and enjoy comfortable running to your heart's content (or until you rack up 300 miles, after which you should replace your Asics as all running shoes start to lose their support and stability after around 300 miles. FYI - many local track clubs have programs in which they collect retired running shoes and donate them to impoverished children and adults. Spread the Asics comfort! Because though the shoes are no longer optimal for running after 300 miles, they still make great ""kick-around"" shoes and are cute and fun for casual wear. Sorry about the digression...

If you run short or medium distances (&lt;30 miles per week), this is the shoe for you."

A couple of notes to help you buy.
Size:
The size of the belt seems to be to the center of five belt holes.
The five holes span 3 1/2 inches total, so you should be able to go about 1 3/4 inches larger or smaller than the size you ordered.
Extra holes:
To make extra holes a hand held leather punch will work fine. If you are comfortable with power tools you can also drill new holes as needed. Place the belt (finished side down) on a chunk of scrap wood, drill from the back (unfinished inside) side of the belt for best results. Have a friend help you as the leather will try to lift when the drill bit goes through. I had to do this as I ordered 2 inches bigger than I measured just to be safe. 
I am very happy with this product"

Barton ""Very Disappointed""",Texas,"When I first saw the dress, it was $18, then the next day it was $22. They would not sell it to me for $18, lady on the phone said it might even go up higher. I bought the red & the blue. Then, a week later, they went BACK DOWN to $18 before I received the dresses. 

The dresses do NOT look like the picture on the site. 
The dress is longer than on the site. The site shows it above the knee's, the two I received, are below the knee, almost mid-calf...& I'm 5'9. 

It is a ""halter"" top. On the site, I think they just rested the straps over her shoulders & did not tie behind her next. ALSO, I knew the dress was cotton, NOT T-SHIRT cotton sundress. 

Now, I have two dresses that I'm not really happy w/. I haven't had time to return them. I bought them looking for a sundress to wear out & about...this, I would probably only wear as a beach cover up or to the pool. Haven't decided. 

Once I get around to getting to a post office, I plan on returning them. I keep trying them on, thinking, ""Ok, it's only $20, I should keep them."" But I most probably would NOT have bought them if I tried them on in the store. 
They would look cute if they were shorter, but that is more money that I would have to spend to shorten the dress. So is it really worth it??? 
Haven't decided yet. The fact I can't decided what to do w/ them, makes me believe I need to return them. If I loved them, I would have already worn them, but I haven't. 

The ONLY nice thing I can say, is the pattern & colors (both the red & the blue) are really pretty. I would be happy if the dresses were above the knee, & NOT T-Shirt Cotton.

A take a few steps and think, 'these are quite comfy.' I smile, another great purchase. I look down. I blink. I look down again to my amazement. The white leather uppers have started to change colors! A darker red at the seams and a lighter pink on the surface of the leather. I continue my walk. A pink storm begins to overwhelm my white beauties! Now, I'm not worried about it, you know, I can handle pink, but deep down inside, I really wanted them to be white. I finish my walk, my macho-ness slightly tainted, re-enter my home, take of my pink three-striped wonders, and set them down to think. They changed back! They are white again. Twas the sun that made them pink. The end.

I fail to appreciate how this product can even be called a wallet when there is no secured compartment for bills.

There's even a velco strip to keep your wallet closed shut, a nice added feature that will allow you to take your wallet out in total darkness without being afraid you might loose something from inside, even if you drop your wallet.

Mitrevski ""jmitrevski2""","Rochester, NY","I really wanted to love this bra. Finding bras that are supportive when your full figured is difficult, not to mention expensive.  I was fitted for this bra before I bought it, but the store didn't have my size so I started looking for the bra online.  I ordered exactly the size that I was fitted for, received my two bras, and the fit was terrible. The bra is too tight, and the cups don't fit.  I'm not spilling out over the sides of the bra, usually the first indicator that the bra doesn't fit, there's all this extra material in the center of the cup.  
Aside from my fitting problems there are two other problems with this bra I'd like to point out.  Being full figured there are two things necessary to support bigger chests.  First, a bra band that is wide and has four hooks on it, this bra does not have that.  Second, you need wide, supportive straps, again this bra does not have wide enough straps. There are better bras out there."

This is not a pretty bra.  I did not buy it to be pretty - I bought it to hold up my 42 c luggage!  I can't say enough positive about this bra.  I haven't had the problems with it that others have had - broken underwires, etc.  I even put mine in a lingerie bag and wash it in the washing machine.  I only bought one six months ago and bought FOUR more today.  The bra I bought six months ago is as supportive today as it was the day I got it this spring.  And I LOVE the way my chest looks in any shirt I've put on over this bra"

Then try this bra,"June 27, 2006",copchick11,Illinois,"Given the fact that I have not been able to EVER find a comfortable bra that also supported my D size chest (and my picky posture and displeasure for underwire), this bra has won the battle.  There's just a couple of quirks, but that could just be me.  When I tighten the straps, they eventually give way and losen up a bit.  I find myself adjusting them every 3-4 wears.  I'm considering sewing the straps permanently at that adjustment. 

I hand wash it in cold water with mild soap and hang to dry. Sometimes tumble on low heat or air tumble and the shape and size stay consistent.  I lost just a hair of weight in my breats and the bra fitted a little loser.  Because of this, vertical ""waves"" in the cup material appeared, but that was because there wasn't enough to fill the bra.  Once I gained that size back (unfortunately!) and filled the cup fully, the ridges disappeared.

I've had this one for 10 months and wear it every day, and it's still in great shape! When this one finally gives in, I'm definitely spending the money to buy another one"

Having stated that, I have been very impressed with the support of this bra.

Having a larger-than-average chest size (the bra I purchased was an ""f"" cup) I have become accustomed to purchasing bras which offer support initially only to, if you'll pardon the pun, let me down within a week or so of wearing them.  ""Tisha"" has offered solid support.  This bra has hiked my bosom up and kept it up all day.  I have not experienced any sagging or shifting of the garment.

As I mentioned the support is excellent, it has even passed the ""jiggle test"".  If I have to hurry somewhere or, heaven forbid, break into a jog ""the girls"" stay where they ought offering no threat of injury to me or any innocent passer-by.  The side supports are, no doubt part of the reason for the bra's effectiveness but they can pinch a bit.  In short, it feels GOOD to take the bra off at the end of the day.  I do not however fantasize about slipping out of it at lunchtime to ease aching shoulders or alleviate pain as I have with some others.

A bra is, quite naturally, a very personal garment and therefore difficult to recommend but I do recommend this bra for large-busted women.  I would happily trade the scores of $30-$40 dollar ""mistakes"" for this style."

I got the leather tags with the cover up flap. I was tired of having mismatched tags that I had scraped up from anywhere and everywhere. I was also looking for a tag that kept my personal information covered up from strangers standing nearby. Another thing I was looking for was a tag that was strong. It was not uncommon for me to pick up my luggage in the airport to discover my tag had been ripped off. Sometimes part of it was left. Sometimes all of it was gone. Luggage and their tags take a lot of abuse.

OK about this product...They are real leather. They are nice looking. There are two reasons why I am giving this product a 4 instead of a 5 rating. First the leather is a little on the thin side. It would be a nice thickness to make a ladies purse or a fine wallet for a businessman in a suit but...a luggage tag? Like I said, these tags need to be virtually indestructable to survive. I am a little dubious that the thin leather strap will really hold up. I may be wrong...this is only my speculation at this point. The second thing is the price. It seems to me that this product should be in the 3 to 4 dollar, each, price range instead of the 5 to 6 dollar range.

There are different colors available which is good (I bought green) because nowadays 95% of all the bags coming down the conveyor are BLACK. Everyone needs something on the outside of their bag to help make it easily identifiable. These colored tags do that"

The variability on sizing and sew quality with the 505s is an issue if you are going to buy them online or mail order. You really have to try them on to see how they fit. The 501 are much easier to buy online or by mail order because the sizing is much less critical on the waist, which is the so-called ""anti-fit"" waist, meaning there is no curve to the rise (the distance between the crotch and the top of the waist), because the original 501s were merely cut down bib overalls which were made to hang, rather than be fitted to the waist. The biggest problem I have noted on the 505's is the variability in size in the thigh area, meaning that some fit baggy and some seem rather tight, even though they are theoretically the same size of a label. Since the 501s are more forgiving as far as sizing, if you are buying online you might consider them instead of 505s, unless you don't want the button fly."

Do not worry about it messing with the magnetic strips on your credit/bank cards. I know this was a concern for me before I bought it, but it turned out to be a false impression. As far as the gentleman who had problems with it demagnetizing his room key, that's typical. In fact, since those are meant to be reprogrammed often, they are not nearly as strong as credit and bank cards. I've had loose change in my pocket demagnetize room keys before. 

Keep in mind the positives: Not only is it very compact, but can hold six credit cards/bank cards, a driver's license, and more. The leather wears very well. Moreover, it is small enough to fomfortably fit into the front pocket of my jeans.

Negatives: Cannot hold fat wads of money, which isn't a problem for me but could be for others"

I am very satisfied about the great comfort in wearing and the beautiful style of these products.
But what I don't understand is the fact I can wash them only cold. How is that possible; normaly you can wash cotton cloths at least in 40 degrees Celcius.
Also my 100 % synthetic running gear I can wash in 40 degrees. 
 
Since I practice a rather active form of yoga I also sweat a lot.
It think would be more fresh / hygienic if I could wash my Prana clothing at least on 40 degrees !
Why does Prana design beautiful sports wear you can't wash in a proper way ??

The quality seems ok - I have not washed them yet so I can't comment on the color fastness - the dark blue seems a like it may fade.The first thing I noticed was that the bodysuits are very long. They are not the stardard length you get with Gerber and Carter's etc. The 0-3 mths has the length of a normal 6-9mth bodysuit. The chest area is ok but the armholes are a bit small. In the bigger sizes the armholes seem normal. I have to wait until my son gets here to decide if I will convert the smaller ones into tees. 
This would have gotten 5 stars if the sizing was right - Hope this helps future buyers!!!"

I like Adidas fleece sweatshirts like this.  They've got good colors, don't fade much if you wash them properly, and they're stylish.  Of this type, I picked up a vibrant orange one which lets people see me from about 30 miles away, and a grey one.  The logo isn't overbearing... it's just enough to say it's a good brand.  But mroe than anything, this... is... so... soft.  With the fall and winter coming up, I'm glad I have my fleece sweatshirts.  Although... technically there are others that are great too.  But... these are great cause' I also matched them perfectly with several Adidas headbands.    

And that is my review on this sweatshirt.  It's soft and warm; perfect if you went to the gym for a work-out, showered, and want something soft for the way home. "

I would certainly never wear this bra while exercising!  I've found it's best as a sleeper bra.

Kinney,"Albany, NY",This is a really nice bag if you're looking for something small and easy to carry.  It's a nice drab olive and the pen holder is very convienent.  The only problem I have is the velcro on the phone pocket doesn't stick very well and opens a little too easliy. 
B0006FMIJ0:not_too_shabby:v._rei,B0006FMIJ0,Venturer Excursion Organizer Bag / Travel Bag: Apparel,apparel,12 of 12,4.0,Not too shabby,"June 18, 2006",V. Rei,,"I was looking for a small bag that would hopefully only carry the essentials, plus a book (a regular sized paperback, not a ""Little Webster""). Ideally, I want one that would carry the essentials (ID, plastic, cash, cell, sunglasses, pen and notepad) as well as a book and a water bottle, but I was just shooting for most of my desires. This little bag holds my essentials just dandy, but it's just shy of carrying a paperback for me. So, for the most part I hardly use that second large zippered pocket. 

The Velcroed cell phone pocket is roomy for my flip-phone, but not too roomy. Next to the pen holder is a small zippered pocket, which runs deep behind the pen and cell phone pockets -ample space for a notepad. The front main zippered compartment holds a small zippered pocket inside that is great for cash and cards. The shoulder strap is removable, and there are straps on the back for looping through a belt or whatnot. I never found it necessary, but you may find it useful.

While it wasn't quite what I was hoping for, it is a good bag all-in-all.

Oh, and fair warning -the bag absolutely stank when it arrived. Blame it on the chemicals that fabrics are treated with, but you will want to toss it in the wash when you get it. And it survives it just fine."

Robinson,,"I would have liked to give these pants 4.5 stars. The half of star I am subtracting is because they can be expensive if they are not on sale.

They are nice looking enough to wear to work (I work at a high-school where the dress code is casual business attire) or to wear on the weekends. I like the detailing on the sides of the legs and the front pockets.

The rise is almost 9"" so they are a low-waisted pant, resting just under the belly button, which is a major reason why they appeal to me so much.

The texture on the outside is a very low-pile velvety fabric that runs on the diagonal. The insides are soft enough to sleep in. These pants are so comfortable I wish I could wear them everyday. 

They have stretch. I refuse to wear stretch jeans, but the stretch is great in these pants. Stretchy jeans will stretch out of shape, but these pants look and feel as new as the day I bought them, which is going on a year now."

A. Brumleve,"chicago, il","I have had this bag for a little over a year, and I love it.  Ok, some stuff you need to know......this bag will charge your cellphone, ipod, pda, camera, and AA and AAA batteries (ipod and batteries require purchase of seperate adaptors.  you can find them at [...])  I think it takes about 6-8 hours to charge from nothing using the sun, but you can confirm that on the above website.  It also has an adaptor to charge the battery at home or in the car.  This backpack will NOT charge your laptop.  The space provided for the solar collection isn't big enough.  There are seperate solar arrays that you can purchase that fold up and go in a backpack (i've seen them for about $200).  The upside to the backpack is that you don't have to be stationary for it to be collecting power, unlike the folding arrays.   I wear mine while walking around chicago, or cycling to and from work and school.  The bag isn't much heavier than a ""non-solar"" bag.  Infact, once i put all my school books in it, i couldn't tell the difference between the weight of this one and my old bag. Even in the cold chicago winter, i can get a charge on a relatively clear day.  (i.e.  it doesn't have to be hot outside, just sunny.)  Also, be aware that this bag has a battery that stores the power you collect until you're ready to use it, some other manufactures have no battery, which means that you have to be in the sun when you want to charge something.  I didn't purchase my bag through amazon, (though i must say i'm thrilled that they are carrying it now.)  I dealt directly with voltaic systems, and their customer service is on point.  i hope this review was helpful to you"

And the concept of the minimizer had intrigued me. Most I'd come across though were either out of my price range or looked too utilitarian.  So I was both excited and cautiously hopeful when I came across this Bali bra online. When it arrived and I tried it on it was perfect!  The fit was true to size and it was very comfortable. I got out my tape measure to see if it reduced my bust measurement by the amount stated in the product information. It did! I was 1 and 1/2 inches smaller and able to wear some clothes I had always loved but that had buttons in the front causing the fabric to pull. No more. And, I usually find underwire bras uncomfortable and this wasn't the case. The bra is also very pretty, not looking at all like a more standard fuller figure bra.

I originally bought my true size, 7.5. I tried them on at the store with the throw-away nylons, my foot slid right in, no problem. When I got home and tried them on again, without the nylon sock as I would normally be wearing them, it was a way tighter fit, especially across the toes. My pinky toe was killing me! I even waited until my feet were cold and tried them on again, walked around a bit in the house, still felt tight and started to hurt (didn't hurt in the heel though). 

I didn't bother trying on the 8 at the store because 8s are usually way too big on me, especially in high heels. I'm pretty much always a true 7.5 unless I'm wearing a narrow-cut ballet flat. I wouldn't say my feet are wide, but they are not narrow either, maybe if you have narrow feet you could wear these easily in your true size, everyone else -- go up half a size (especially because patent leather is stiffer than regular leather)! I noticed a huge difference in the feeling of the width across the toes in the size 8 - my pinky toe was no longer being strangled. 

I went back to the store this morning, tried the 8 (without the nylons) and they fit perfectly! So much so that I would say that they are really comfortable shoes, and I wear a lot of heels because I'm only 5' tall."

The frilly lacework which decorates the waist band - as well as the two lengths which dive between your thighs - make this Flutter Butt crotchless panty extremely pretty!  

As an added touch, there's another small piece of the lacey stuff - as well as a handsome ribbon-like bow - featured down front.  Although they might be hard to see in the accompanying photo - both serve to give the overall garment a much more finished appearance - while also offering an attractive focal point for the eye!

The fluffy waistband on this Flutter Butt crotchless undie - also helps to accentuate your hips - by providing a little skirt-like appearance.

If you have other frilly lingerie, this crotchless knicker - by heightening the tease - might make this a very fun and memorable addition to your collection. 


For me, my most baby-like babydoll nightie - which had a short bodice and a billowy skirt (with almost no waist) - ended up coordinating quite nicely.  It also helped that my hubby had ordered this Flutter Butt undie in ""white"" rather than ""red.""

When I sprang this outfit on my better-half, I also made certain to peek up at him - with my most shyly innocent (and dopey) expression - while using my index finger to seductively play with my lower lip!  (Hey, it works!)

And ""no"" - I didn't round out my ensemble by putting bows in my hair - and by clutching a giant lollipop (by the stick) in my other hand!

If you love frilly lingerie, this Flutter Butt crotchless undie from Love Fifi may be perfect - for adding a little SPICINESS -- to your INNOCENCE!  Enjoy"

Thomas,Washington DC,"Overall these shoes fit fairly well, are stylish in appearance, and the price is right. The only concern I have is that they seem to run a little short in length (odd for NB). I have been buying NB shoes for as long as I can remember, and this is the first time my toes were obviously at the very end of the toe box. They look good though, and provide the great arch support New Balance is famous for.

It's always a good idea to try on shoes before you buy them, but the online price is so seductive, it's difficult to pass up the ""deal"". If possible, try to find some at your local shoe store before you purchase these, as the pictures don't show you all angles of this shoe, and parts of the trim are (in my opinion) ""goofy"" looking.

Overall, I'd recommend these shoes for walking/jogging/going to the gym. If you want some serious running shoes, spring for the higher-end Asics, NB's, Saucony's, etc."

Rinderer ""rindeee""",St. Louis,"I am a deployed Navy Reservist.  I am currently assigned to a tactical expeditionary unit deployed to the middle-east where I serve in a TACCOMM/Tactical Crypto Support role in land and maritime operations.  Before deploying, I spent a great deal of time and effort in selecting the 'right boot' in which I knew I would be spending a great deal of time.  I tried Oakley, Converse, 5.11 and of course the Bates M-9.  I felt that there was no contest.  The Bates was by far the most comfortable and seemed to have the most functional sole design and least potentially irritating upper, and so on. 

Let me re-wind a little bit.  In my civilian life, outside of the Reserve (which at this point seems a distant memory) I am an avid runner, to the tune of about 70 miles per week.  While I've run many hundred of miles on roads, my focus over the past couple of years has shifted to off-road 'trail runs' and ultra-marathon courses.  I know my feet.  I know what works in a shoe that is going to be demanded to perform in horrible conditions.  I have had great success over time with literally one pair of shoes from one manufacturer and as such I bought many pairs of that shoe.  In June of 2006, I bought my first pair of M-9 Desert Assault boots to take on my July deployment.  I decided that in order to break them in, I'd take them on the trail.  I figured that they'd tear my feet up a bit, but it wouldn't be the first time a new shoe had done so.  The day I first wore them I set off with an 85lb. pack into a tick infested trail in a local state park.  It was about 100 degrees outside with humidity nearly to match.  After 12 miles on the trail I returned home to find that my feet were all but un-fouled!  I was amazed.  I would repeat this process a few times and very soon after ordered two additional pairs of M-9s. 

Fast forward just a bit. While in pre-deployment training in Coronado, CA, I took to wearing my boots for all of our PT.  I also logged about 30 to 50 miles per week of independent running, again, in my M-9s.  Most of these runs included a pack with about 50 - 70lbs in it, though now I was running almost entirely on pavement.  My M-9's performed without flaw.  I left Coronado for the middle east without any doubt that I had the best boots I could have possibly chosen, and they were well broken in to boot. ;)

Fast forward some more.  Recently I was able to take a two day MWR trip in order to run the Dubai (UAE) Marathon...in my M-9s.  While we (there were five of us from my unit that ran the marathon) have had almost no opportunity to do any training runs while in theater, I knew that if I were to tackle 26.2 miles on pavement (man, I hate running on pavement), there was no way I was going to do so without wearing my 'old faithfuls'.  They did not disappoint!  While I took a very conservative pace, my M-9s carried me with ease to the finish line.  My Chief, also the proud owner of a well beaten pair of M-9's ran the marathon with me, his first ever.  He too wore his M-9s, as his running shoes were simply shot.  He was nothing short of elated to have finished his first marathon attempt, and others were nothing short of amazed that he did it in 'combat boots'.  If they only knew. ;)  I must say, I've never had so many people come up to me during a marathon to chat and in every case, the topic was my choice of footwear.  In every instance I would simply tell them with a smile, ""You don't understand, these are really great boots."" 

In short, Bates created a nearly perfect boot. Are there things I would change? Certainly. But even if Bates never changes a thing about them, I will keep buying them until I am not longer able to run, which I assure you will not be for a very long time.  I have already scheduled additional marathons and ultra-marathons (off road of course) for after I return home, and I'll let you guess what my choice of footwear will be.  I have found my new 'running shoe'."

They are so comfortable and I expect to get many years of use of them.

One small problem, the inside sole is orange and I found that it turns my socks yellow from the dye.  I called customer service for Merrell and they are sending me a complimentary insole in a neutral color...so they fixed the problem.

My waist so 32 so I deciced to go with L. Reading the previous review I figured they will be exactly my size. Big mistake!..When I got them,even bofore I tried them on,I measured the waist. They were true to the L size. I had few M size swimwear around and I compared the waist...it was an inch larger then anything size M. So whoever sugested to get one size biger was wrong!Or maybe he had wishfull thinking about his waist size..;)

        Now the good news..they stretch! So the L size still looked ok on me,because they didn't stretch at all. I have some wrinkels showing but it's nothing major.

        The product itself is a high quality product. They look sexy..,but you have to have the right body for them too. Don't expect to look good if you are fat.They will make you look even fatter! They are not that low rise either,my butt crack isn't showing. The picture is actually very accurate and you can see how high they sit.

     As far as ""you can see everything""..as another reviewer mentioned, maybe he was comparing them to his boardshorts? I don't see any big difference between these trunks and any other smimwear in the same style. They are definetly not ""see through""!

     I'd love to exchange them for the size M....but the return policy allows absolutely no exchanges or returns,and that sucks! I wonder how different it is if I would go to their store and try them on in a fitting room? Also,it took one week for shipping."

I wish they were a little higher rise in that back, but if you like showing booty crack, these are the trunks for you.

The fabric is really nice and smooth, and they are without doubt some sexy trunks. 

BUT MAKE SURE YOU ORDER THEM IN A SIZE LARGER THAN YOU NORMALLY WEAR. I am 6'2 with a 34 waist and I SHOULD have ordered an XL and not an L. I can deal with the size I have, but I prefer to have a little more room. Also note. YOU CANT RETURN THESE. ITS IS AGAINST THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CODE"

Believe me, this trunk truly has a pouch. A big one. Its actually just the right size for me, and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it/filling it. The lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas, so its really nice.

Of course, the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this ""no-show."" I had no problem with this being no show, wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it. Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants :)

For me, this trunk was not uncomfortable, given its diminished size and intent to be no-show. Granted, in those moments of excitement, things do get a little more - eh, crowded. But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear. I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief/boxerbrief/trunk.

This pair is made of 100% cotton, so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the X-Factor line may enjoy this feature. My only complaint is that the leg openings do not ""cling"" to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon, etc. But that is just minor.

The waistband is, as always, a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height, in keeping with the no-show design.

May I suggest you go for the extra-bold 2(x)ist No Show Trunk 3133C, which comes in contrasting colors - same product, same price, just sexier!

I cannot reccommend this trunk enough, and within hours, it became my favorite 2(x)ist product in my collection"

BUT the bag does NOT CLOSE.  AT ALL.  Apparently ther is some sort of built in hidden magnetic closure that is supposed to secure the top flap to the front of the bag.  This does not work (at least on my bag).  

WORSE STILL, even if this magnet thing worked, the sides of the flap are still totally open, and anything small that you have in your bag can fall out if thebag is in anything but a perfectly upright position.

So much for using this as a carryon bag, or putting it in the trunk of a car.  It is totally unreliable.  I am definitely returning this bag"

Casual Long Sleeve Oxford: Apparel,apparel,,5.0,"Strong Oxford, Soft Striping","April 4, 2007",Mohicangirl,"Old Town, Alexandria, VA","I was fortunate to be able to pick up the Chocolate Lab striped Oxford when it was offered in the winter.  There's nothing plain about this Oxford.  I would say classic because of the clean lines and gentle shaping provided by the darts in the back.  An additional benefit generally about all of Bealls' long-sleeve Oxfords is that they are shorter in length than most traditional Oxfords.  Most Oxford shirts are about 27""-28"" in length in a Misses size (0-20), but Bealls' tend to run about 25""-26"" depending on your size for proportion.  The advantage is that you do not feel the need to tuck, but you can still tuck if you would like.  Personally, I have never been a fan of tucking shirts into pants or skirts, especially if you want to highlight either.

Whoever sews these garments takes great care.  The back darts are aligned perfectly and the button thread is done criss-cross style with a double looping underneath for extra strength.  The actual striping of the shirt is straight.  I've seen with some more expensive shirts where someone either didn't follow the pattern correctly or tried to correct an improper pattern badly.  To me, that makes a tremendous difference whether I will come back for more.

I am looking forward to more colors again.  The Chocolate Lab stripe is the only one I own and I've had many ask me where I purchased.  I would love to see all of the colors which are offered in the 3/4 sleeve version with the addition of a Kelly green, Gatsby Yellow (short-sleeve version color) and perhaps even a beautiful Violet.

Definitely try this shirt because I know you will be pleased"

I ordered on a Thursday evening and received the dress on Monday (I do live in the same state where the company is in).  However, the dress is too tight.  I'm 5 ft 4 inches, weigh 120 lbs., and I usually wear a women's size 2 (i.e., Banana Republic, Express).  I will be exchanging the item for a medium.  For the price, the dress is a good bargain.  It is sheer on the bottom, so you will need a slip underneath.  The beading is nice (extra beads are included) and the way the dress flares out at the bottom is very unique.  The dress was long on me, and would probably need to be taken in at least 3 inches.  The clasp are loosely sewn on (two broke after I took off the dress), so I would have a seamstress sew it on more tightly.  The dress also arrives folded, so you will need to take care of the wrinkles.  Overall, I'm happy with the dress for its price and design and I can't wait to receive the correct size"

Godfrey ""dejakitty""",California,"This dress is really very beautiful and I would have been perfectly happy with it if only it had fit me.  The sizing chart on the website is not right. I am a size 5 (5 ft 6 in) so I ordered a medium as the sizing chart suggested but it was HUGE!  Unfortunately I was told by PacificPlex that they were sold out of smalls in the white color (although they are selling them now).  I had to get my dress altered in the bust and waist (the length was perfect).  The material is not ""satin"" as stated but a satin-like polyester which is a bit see-through so definitely need a slip or something.  For the price it is still great.  
I've been looking for my dress for months and couldn't find any that were slim fitting with a halter top so when I saw this dress (at only $119) I was pretty excited.  I've never bought clothes online and I'm not sure I will in the future but I am glad I bought this dress. 
I just wish PacificPlex would have told me they had more dresses on order(as I was still well within the 30 day refund guarantee).  It would have been cheaper to exchange than to get the alterations. Although my seamstress did say that based on how big the medium was on me, the small probably would have needed to be taken in as well.  Oh well, it fits and I'm happy now"

I have to say it is absolutely, positively PERFECT.  Everything I could want in a wedding gown. No frills, no lace, no bows.  Just elegance.  The irridescent bugle beads and swarovski crystals span the length of the train. 

Every day, I pull the gown from the closet and 'OOOoooo & Aaaaahhh'. Can't wait to wear it.*November's a long way off*. My fiance even agrees on how gorgeous it is (honest). Even the close-ups don't do the gown justice.

Oh, yeah, and the price...the best $119 I've ever spent.
Shipping was speedy.

B000BQ0DL4:very_convenient_and_compact:_an_essential_hair_tool:joanna_daneman,B000BQ0DL4,Hair Curlers for Travel: Apparel,apparel,5 of 5,5.0,Very convenient and compact: an essential hair tool,"July 15, 2006",Joanna Daneman,"Middletown, DE USA","I have short hair, not ultra-short, but short, and I find that a few hot curlers can make a big difference in volume on ""bad hair days."" While I have a full-sized Conair curler set, I discovered that my travel set was really best suited to my hair length. So travel or not, this little set has become a real favorite. 

What you get 
The Remington Travel Hair curlers come in a nylon bag with the heating unit build in. The top is clear and fastened by velcro. You pull it open and plug it in to start heating the rollers. On the side of the nylon bag is a smaller, oblong bag holding the roller clips. 

There are five medium rollers (about an inch in diameter) and five small rollers, about 5/8 inch diameter.) There are two sets of clips, pink for the large roller, white for the smaller roller. The clip fits around the roller, and has a tab to aid grabbing it for removal. 

The rollers turn from pink to greyish white when they are heated. They fit into the base over a socket with two prongs. They heat up in about 2 minutes. 

How they work 

The rollers claim to have ""Ionic Technology"" to reduce static and the frizzies. I find that my hair is indeed smooth when I take it out of the rollers. After I let the curls cool, I can style with no frizz. 

The ends of the rollers stay cool to avoid burning your head. They are a bit heavy. 

I leave the rollers in for five to fifteen minutes, by which time my hair is well-curled. 

Upsides, downsides 
To keep this set compact, there are only 10 rollers. I could use a few more, even with my short hair. The built-in travel bag is very well designed and compact for a suitcase or small bathroom. 

If you LOSE THE CLIPS, you can find a general replacement style of clip for about $10 at http://www.ballbeauty.com/remington_hair_setters.htm#CLIPS. I dropped two of my white clips and the cats apparently made off with them as trophies of their hunting prowess. So this is helpful to know where to buy more clips. 

The curls last long, though they aren't as stiff as with some of the more expensive, foam covered type of curlers"

They can be worn during hiking trips without the fear of the soles being punctured by brush. 

It's rare to see, but the Betula spinoff of Birkenstock comes and goes every couple years or so. The pair Im replacing are Betulas and I bought them 3yrs ago. As it turns out, you can have Birkenstock sandals repaired over time as long as the cork isnt too badly damaged. All one has to do is take them to a liscensed dealer and 25.00 later, you have a repaired pair of sandals. 

Other brands can come up with knockoffs, but nothing matches a true anatomically correct Birkenstock. 

I suggest going to a store that sells Birkenstocks and seeing what size your largest foot is before buying online so as to avoid the hassle of having to mail back the sandals and trying to get the correct size. Once you have all the necessary info, you are set to buy them to your feet's content. You wont regret buying these sandals. The comfort is unmatched. It doesnt matter if you are using them around the house or taking them on a tour of a big city. They wont let your feet become weary"

My last four pairs of running shoes have been ASICS and every pair has impressed me and kept my knees and feet pain free - even through my weekly long runs, which are up to 13 miles each.
(Asics make great running socks too, which make all the difference if you run longer distances.)

This particular shoe, ASICS GT-2120, is my favorite so far. I prefer this shoe to the more pricey ASICS Kayano, which provides less cushion and costs $135 per pair.

Just when I thought it impossible to love my GTs any more - ASICS outdid itself with the GT-2120."

And it has a very nice cotton plaid lining inside that gives the jacket the feel of wearing a coat and not that thin nylon windbreaker feel.  Yet, it seems as light as a nylon windbreaker.  Should it rain, the water rolls right off due to the Teflon coating.  Under the front flaps up to the neck is a netting that allows the coat to breathe and keep things comfortable inside.  The neck area and the zipper flap keep out the wind and rain when it's too warm outside for a heavy coat.  And it's machine washable and dryer safe.  I like how it looks on me and the way it feels wearing it.

I've been testing out new jocks for the last week or so, and I gotta tell you this one is GREAT.  It FEELS like a jock should feel, where you're supported but it's not digging or pinching.  The 3-inch wide waistband is neither too tight or too big, and has different but distinctive green and black stripes.  The pouch is so HOT, it really cups and supports you, in just the right way so you're not feeling too constricted.  My test for all Jocks is the treadmill to see if I'm bouncing around too much, or if there is too much movement which could cause abrasions.  This one passed with flying colors.  Its a great woven pouch, that's absorbant and breathes well.  Definitely gives Bike a run for its money.  A GREAT, GREAT JOCK!! "

My twins resist being swaddled (but they sleep much better swaddled) so it's important to me to have something that's fast and easy to use. I stopped using the sack when my babies outgrew it, and now I only used the outer wrap. I removed the top piece of velcro on the back of the wrap (designed to attach to the sack) because it seems like it could be irritating. I know that there's some SIDS rationale for using the sack plus the wrap, but I do the wrap really tight so I'm confident that there's no way it could come off and get over my babies' heads.

Some tips: I tighten the velcro iteratively -- I wrap the baby snuggly once, then I open up each half and re-tighten it. Also, I wrap the bottom half of my babies in a snug traditional swaddle with a blanket. They like having their legs tightly wrapped, and this system allows me to focus on their arms with the Halo wrap and on their legs with a blanket"

These did not disappoint me.  Working as a carpenter/woodworker, I am in these boots all day long.  My feet never get tired or sore from being in them.  Have added some comfort insoles, but that is due to my foot being a 12AA rather than a medium or D width as most men's feet.  Foot never get hot, they stay dry and in winter warm.  

When I am not working, my regular shoes seem to not comfort me as well.  Walking a mall or just getting around town in street shoes can make my  back and  legs ache after only a couple hours.  Yet, these Pit Boss boots can let me be on my feet standing/walking for as much as 10hrs straight without feeling sore.

These have been a blessing climbing or standing on ladders for extended time as the sole is solid enough to give me a good platform to stand on.  The ankle height of them is enough to have saved me  several times from twisting or damaging my ankle.

Been using this pair for over two years.  Soles are about worn out, but expect to buy this boot again.  Leather looks rough now, but has not torn or worn through anywhere. "

...Very sturdy and extra padding for comfort. But be warned, My daughters larger text books dont fit,nor does her mead trapper looseleaf or her nike portfolio. The top corner sticks out about two to three inches and zipper is unable to fully close, so she has to carry them in her hands; which kind of defeats the purpose of carrying a handsfree bag. Spiral notebooks and mead composition books(black and white) fit perfectly. 

...Another gripe is she is probably 100 pounds soaking wet, so the strap isn't flush to her body. Shes a tall slim 13 1/2 year old. It will fit the chubbies and the bustier girls a whole lot better. The velcor strip is short, so there isn't much more ability to adjust to make it tighter.

...Samsonite can either make the strap shorter so it doesnt hit her booty when she walks or lenghten the amount of velcro they use so theres more ability to adjust the fit. We thought that during the colder months it might fit a little better with her winter coats, but it still hits her too low on her body. We'd rather it be a more snug fit. She still loves it though, because of the color and it holds all her stuff well...cell phone, ipod, keys, bus pass,pens etc. Minus 1/2 a star for size and fit. Overall great bag,4 1/2 stars"

Hopkins,,"There is a ""possible"" defect in the M1122 model. I wanted to post my experience here in case others are having this same problem. After wearing the M1122 shoe for only a few months, my pair started producing a very strong odor. The smell was not from the inside but from the outer backside, specifically the area consisting of the ENCAP material which, according to New Balance, is a polyurethane plastic. The smell gradually got worse, so bad in fact, I had to keep them in my garage with the smell being like a mildew/urine odor. I don't own pets, nor had I gotten anything sprayed on it. The smell didn't suddenly occur either, it gradually became more intense over a few weeks. Washing the shoes in the washer wouldn't get the smell out so I returned them to a New Balance store in late December 2006, and they replaced it with a new pair. Up until this past week (late March 2007), the new pair has been great, but now they have started putting off the very same odor, again, not inside the shoe, but coming from the areas on the shoe that the ENCAP material is featured. I decided to call New Balance directly and informed them of the problem. They told me that they did in fact have other complaints from people all commenting of an odd odor coming from the M1122 model shoe. NB requested the pair be sent to them for testing. If you have experienced this problem with your M1122 (or other models), contact New Balance customer support via their website. 

** With regards to comfort I give this shoe a five star, but with regards to the problem above, I would have to give it a zero star. A common ground, I have it two stars but based on the problem I have experienced now in TWO pairs of the exact same shoe"

A little over 10 years ago, my sister turned me on to them.  Genetically, we're predisposed to big bustlines, which has its advantages and disadvantages - one of the latter trying to find bras that fit and support and still look good.  I've tried many, many other sports bras (trying to find one from the $20 range that works) and none of the other compare - the racerback types don't give me enough support - other 'high compression' bras create that oh-so-unattractive 'uniboob' look; underwire sports bras have a very short life - they're a pain to keep washed and it doesn't take long for the underwire to pop out of the underarm area (ouch - always seemed to happen during a heavy workout!), et cetera.

The Champion Action Shape takes care of ALL of that.  There is enough separation where this looks fine even wearing under a shirt (I've even been able to wear this bra under a blouse or sweater if I'm planning on going horseback riding after work).  The straps and fasteners are totally adjustable.  The bra is mostly cotton, there might be some lycra or polyester there but I'm a cotton freak - no itchiness, no seams that chafe, and best of all NO UNDERWIRE!  It's totally supportive - as I mentioned, I ride horseback (this trumps the popular rider's ""No Bounce Bra"" that sells for over $50 and has a ton of hooks - like a corset - UGH), and am also a gym rat, doing high-impact aerobics, weight training, Spinning, Pilates and yoga - this bra is EMINENTLY suitable for all those activities.  Care is easy - just toss it in the washer and dryer or air dry (I generally airdry as the hooks have a tendency to get caught in the 'holes' in the dryer).  And they look GOOD.  I just wear this as a top on its own.

BTW Champion has come out with a new color this year - Champion RED.  I just got it and it looks AWESOME!

HIGHLY recommended"

I have not worn the garment; therefore, I cannot critique it except to say it was packaged very well. I hope it is really ""ivory"" because I do not look good in Clorox white"

Perfect for beach or pool or gardening or running errands, these shoes are one-piece construction with plenty of drainage for wet conditions.  They are light and pack easily, and come at a very reasonable price.

Best of all, these shoes are wide.  I have wide feet, big wide ugly feet, but I rarely buy wide because the heel on such shoes is too loose for me.  The end result?  I'm limited to boxy styles from pricey european makers (ecco, dansko, etc)  that I buy in medium width -- generally about one  to one-and-a-half sizes bigger than my foot measures.  With the Kobo III, I could fit my actual size.  I haven't done that since I was a teenager.

I wish I'd known about these shoes when I was pregnant and my feet got even wider!

My only complaint is that they are obviously a casual sport shoe--no real way to dress them up and make them go with everything.  "

Wilner ""Bruce D. Wilner""","Alexandria, VA [USA]","Be forewarned! Never mind all the mellifluous flubdrub about nature-formed last, footwear classic, nineteen sixty-five, etc. The facts of the matter are that (a) the Irish factory where Wallabees were handmade with love closed down in the late 1990s; (b) the product has been made in mainland China since that time; (c) the materials and workmanship don't begin to come close to their former standards, which is duly reflected in the downward price shift ($180 in 1998 but $110 in 2006, inflation notwithstanding); yet (d) the Web sites--which claim that the shoe is ""even better""--seem to have no problem with posting photos of the no-longer-available Irish craftsewns while shipping the Chinese hack jobs. Very, very disappointing, gentlemen.  (I once found a fellow in Ottawa who had bought up considerable quantities of sand suede Wallabees and was selling them at a premium--$225--that I was happy to pay, but even he ultimately went out of business, just like Peter, my custom Birkenstock sandalmaker in Germany.)

I once phoned the vendor to complain, and some imbecile tried to explain to me that the product was ""better than ever."" I flew into a rage, telling her what she could do with her lies. I also chastised her for having the brass-bound gall to lie to me, a diehard Wallabee fan who has continuously owned (and worn, day in and day out) several pairs--sand suede, oakwood suede, brown leather, and/or black leather--since the age of fifteen, two-thirds of a lifetime ago! (The oakwood [= dark brown] suede were always my favorites, since the sand suede always looked a little too smart-Alecky for me, making me look [quite accurately!] like an upper-middle-class New York City Jewish boy--just mate them with Sergio Valente jeans, a creamy velour shirt, and an ultra-expensive sweater.)

All that having been vented, the Wallabee is still a reasonably comfortable shoe--assuming you can find two members of a pair that actually match within a reasonable margin of deviation! Teenage kids won't know the difference, but baby-boomers will be moved to tears. Get with the program and buy either a pair of those ultra-advanced, computer-designed, ruggedized flip-flops (there are scores of vendors) or some quality suede sneakers (leather ones are far too oppressive for the educated foot).

Bean and Timberland,"October 8, 2006","John P. Thiel ""John T.""","Astoria, Queens, New York City","Before Carhartt goes the way of L.L. Bean, Fox Racing Inc., and Timberland (and Barney's New York for that matter) stock up on great, genuinely tough, useful, comfortable, and attractive clothing like these shorts--and everything else Carhartt makes.  These are clothes that make you feel and look good (""comfort clothes"" you might say) while you're rolling around in the dirt or even on your living room floor.

I laude the previous reviewer's honesty in saying they're great for wearing without underwear in the hot weather, because they really, really are.  Jeans / denim and most cotton cloth can get hot, and that can be  real uncomfortable particularly for a man's 'bait and tackle;' whereas this cloth breathes exceptionally well.  They're particularly great for after doing endurance sports and taking a shower--when you're body is still all reved up--as a loose, comfortable cool-down clothing that you're fine wearing the rest of the day.

The pockets and loops are also very handy, not only for working on a car, bike, or doing construction, but also plenty big enough to carry your cell phone (even my Treo), keys, and wallet comfortably without being like those huge, ugly military-style thigh pockets.

I expect Carhartt might someday start marketing itself just like other great, functional brands that went hip-hop style or suburb/country sheik, and if they do it will be a real loss.  But for now at least we can enjoy another in that long series of brands that became famous for function before it was popularized as a suburban teenager fashion and then ruined. "

Basically, this binder has pretty much everything I was looking for:  three ring construction, a sturdy zipper closure to keep discs safe and contained, and a sewn-in handle at the back so it's portable.  A plus about this particular model is that the rings are slightly oversized for the stated capacity, so there is the possibiity of expanding by buying more sheets.  I bought three, and they work great.  I will buy more - several more, because they are the best option there is at present.  

Let me tell you, however, what I don't like about them.  First, the cover is some sort of plastic or vinyl.  I can see this cracking or disintigrating in a couple of years, even with gentle treatment.  Second, there isn't a proper spine to the binder:  it's basically a single, flexible sheet that wraps around the outside but doesn't make square corners.  That means it will look  untidy on the shelf and also makes me question its long-term durability.  Third, the sleeves:  they are too tight to put the disc and the artwork in the same slot, the ones closest to the rings have their corners notched in to accomodate the rings, and the slits are oriented to the zipper side instead of to the top.   

Those drawbacks aside, I plan to buy more of these.  They are the best choice available now, but I wouldn't hesitate to ditch them if something better became available.  If you are looking for a safe, flexible, and smart place to store a lot of cds, this item should be at the top of your list.  "

I like the fact that it is zippered on three sides, keeps everything in the wallet. I am female, and while wallets are traditionally a male style, I wanted something that wasn't just a coin purse or a typical woman's purse - you know, with the clasp pouch for coins and dividers etc, b/c I find those very cumbersome. This is compact, light, it has plenty of pockets, slots and dividers inside - that zip again comes in handy if you fill up all the spaces inside it ensures you won't lose anything.
I gave it four stars instead of five just b/c the coin pocket (while strategically placed and pleasingly compact) is a little hard to get your fingers in to put coins in and take them out quickly, it's kind of tight. Also, the center divider (for your pictures or drivers license etc.) sometimes gets in the way when you want to zip the wallet up - like if you are in a hurry to get out of the line at Starbucks and you are struggling to shove your change in the little slot and zip it up!
But this really is a great purse/wallet. I love it and the soft leather, which the interior of the wallet is also made of - it's not just a cheap fabric filler inside, looks and feels really nice"

After a few outings with my Chuck Taylors, my dogs were killing me and I knew I had to get new shoes. I had never heard of this brand before I tried them on, but I knew once they went on, this was the shoe for me.

I use these shoes with the Nike Sports kit, the RunAway by Switcheasy and my iPod Nano to keep track of my mileage. I feel my feet, not the shoes - and that's how it should be. Most importantly, after my 2+ miles of walking, my feet aren't sore as they were with my Converse, my New Balance and my Nike shoes.

It was certainly WELL worth the price I paid. 

If you like wearing extreme low-rise jeans or simply do not want to flash your waistband for any reason, then this brief is for you. Period. 

For those men who wear standard low-rise jeans or the like, then you do not NEED this, but you still very well may WANT it. 

Clearly this brief is meant to do two things (1) make it so that you can wear very low-rise pants and (2) make it so you look irresistable when you are NOT wearing your low-rise pants. 

I found that even though the underwear is cotton - as opposed to the synthetics of the X-Factor line, for example, this brief still conforms to my body's contours pretty well. Actually very well everywhere except it bunches a LITTLE where it meets the very inside of my thigh. Regardless, this is going to show off everything you got, and subsequently make it look (more-or-less) more impressive. 

Practical consideration: the pouch and the area above is reduced in size since it is accomodating the very low-rise. Translation: be cautious when you get aroused as there is not a great deal of ""expansion room"". Enough said on that, but that is why I gave this pair 4/5 stars. Everything else is great. I never had a problem with my rear being exposed in these briefs. 

If you forsee this as being a problem for you, then may I suggest the 2(x)ist Contrast Countour Pouch Brief 3103C? It is the same price (at review time) and the same materials but in a standard cut and features sexy contrast lines. I own it as well and you may read my review about it on its product page"

The House of Rice silk parasol, however, is an exception to the rule. They manage to be pretty, useful and surprisingly sturdy.

Except for a white, painted handle, the parasol's frame is entirely made of bamboo. It looks fragile, but is surprisingly sturdy, especially since it is bound together with colorful threads and bamboo pegs. Over that is asemi-transparent pale yellow silk canopy, and a matching ribbon on the top to hang it from.

How does it stand up in the sun? Well, the silk is technically transparent, but when unfolded it does provide a certain amount of shade -- about the same as a pair of sunglasses. Aesthetically, it is also very good, simple and unadorned except by a few extra scraps of silk, but very elegant and understated. The only problem is that to keep the parasol open, you have to essentially shove it up onto a jutting wedge of bamboo. It's a bit of a pain to close.

The House of Rice silk parasol is meant to look pretty, but it can also be used for the parasol's origina function. Definitely a good find, if you can get it closed easily"

I had purchased this item after trying out one of the silcone skins that ripped apart after about 3 months of use.  I use my MP3 player when I go running and so I need an armband product that can withstand the elements and my running.  

After using this product only 3 times, it began to fall apart as follows:

1.  The protective screen cover is nothing but a flimsly piece of plastic that is glued to the case.  It basically falls apart when you try and squeeze your vision M into the case. 
2.  There are these oddly placed velcro dots on the armband that are used to secure it after you wrap it around your arm.  The huge design flaw is that the dots needs to line up on top of one another in order to be secure.  So, if you arm is an odd sign you end up having to make it tighter in order to align the dots.  If you're in the market for a tourniquet, then you should buy this product. 
3.  If you sweat at least a drop while you exercise or run (if you don't then you're not really exercising), the velcro dots lose their stick-um.  I discovered that the fuzzy part of the velcro was glued onto the armband.  As it heats up from your body temperature rising, it literally melts and causes the dots to fall off.  It was because of this that my MP3 player almost flew off my arm and onto the cement.  

So, if you are looking to shatter your MP3 player, then buy this nifty product.  I think that my son (age 4) could've designed a better arm band holder in his pre-school class. "

Good quality, but a mixed review.  ","June 23, 2006","Eager  Reader ""elenaruggs""","Braintree, MA","Shoes.com provided wonderfully fast service and a decent sandal price.  Too bad my feet are so impossible; my fault, not theirs!  A friend with a larger size and  medium width tells me she has worn hers ""Margie"" sandal comfortably for 12 years.  They still look new, as evidenced by my ordering them after seeing how lovely they were when she wore them to a recent event.

Bass always produces a good product.  I ordered the ""tan distressed"" and they are beautiful sandals, with sumptuously comfy soles.  They are adequately sturdy, while also enabling feet to still look dainty and shapely.  For the $30 which I paid, free postage, they are a fairly good buy.  

Nevertheless, these sandals are not perfectly comfortable for me, perhaps more my fault than theirs.  My advice to a person with small, narrow feet is that this product may not be exactly right.  The front straps are in a fixed position, as are most strappy sandals, while the back ones are adjustable.  This said, the size 7 Narrow is not for a truly narrow foot, mainly due to the positioning and size of the front straps.  

I will keep these sandals and can wear them ""around,"" but on day trips or shopping I would probably not be able to endure the slight floppiness.  There is just a tad too much give for my  foot.  Even the back strap isn't quite perfect for me, as it tends to force the foot forward when adjusted in the tightest position.  Yet I need the very tightest buckle hole in order to keep the shoe on my foot at all.  

Would I have bought these had I been shopping in a store, where I could have tried them on?  Probably not.  But I've been to dozens of quality shoe stores already this summer, to no avail seeking my size in this type sandal. At one point, I went store-to-store at a huge outlet mall, hitting every place with shoes, including Bass itself.  At one store, Etienne Aigner, I was so frustrated that I made the comment that they no longer carried either my size or my style.  When the saleswoman heard I wore a narrow, she said, ""Oh we'll, never go back to THOSE again.""  It seems as if most stores consider customers with dainty, narrow feet an oddity, not deserving to find shoes at all.   So perhaps, in spite of my dissatisfaction with the sandals in question, I did well by ordering them.  "

Bui ""Evenstar Angel""","MA, USA","The case arrived looking as good as it did in the pictures. I thought it looked stylish/retro. I read from the other reviews there were scratches caused mainly the space above the click wheel and below the screen. 

I checked the stitching before placing my 30GB video iPod in. The stitchings around the border were soft. But when I felt the stitchings around the click wheel hole I can see why there were alot of complaints of ipod scratching around there. The sitchings were a bit more rough aound the click wheel than it is around the screen. But from other reviews i have read, there were no scratches from long term use of the case.

But i have nothing to worry about because I have kept the plastic adhesive sheet that came with the iPod. So I suggest to those who want to be cautious, try buying the adhesive protective sheet if you dont have it or you could just wrap your iPod in saran wrap.

After just taking my iPod out it left some sticky residue on the back, ugh, took me forever to rub it off the edges but it still left some residue. On the sides with in the base there is a lining of glue...figures. 
But its still a good case. Guess you just have to fully cover your ipod front and back before putting it in"

Although it doesn't completely cover every surface of the ipod (you can see the sides a little near the top), it protects most of the ipod from scratches and smudges.  The leather on this case is soft to the touch.  The flip-design is nice, and the magnets work much better than a snap or velcro would - I was also wary of the magnets screwing up my harddrive, but I haven't had a problem with it.

One more thing: the belt clip is a piece of leather on the back with velcro and a snap, so there is a chance that it could get ripped off of your belt if you are doing some wild activity while wearing your ipod on your belt.  I just keep mine in my pocket"

About... 2 days later, my IPod fell out of my jacket pocket and tumbled hard down a flight of CONCRETE stairs.  I was sure that it was damaged... but, I opened the case, turned it on, and and was fine.... I was quite relieved.  That alone justifies the price of the case. I am proud to say that it is still in there to this day, and the only thing I could have asked for would have been a somewhat tighter fit around the clickwheel, as there is a bit of space for dirt/dust to get into.  That and the whole made for the headphones could be a tad bigger. "

For those who are worried about showing off the design of the IPod this is not for you, but for people who are deathly afraid of dropping the IPod or scratching it, this is it. The clickwheel is VERY accessible as are the ports. It won't fit in a dock, but if you don't have the dock it can stay on when connected to your computer with just the wire.  I also love the look of it. It looks like a wallet.

One note, if you are interested in hanging this from a belt loop with the back strap, it is functional but a bit awkward.  The snap and the velcro are safe enough to keep it on, but it always seems to be in the wrong position to fiddle with. 

I am very happy with this purchase"

Denny,"Muncie, IN United States","For the cost--I thought--might as well try this gadget--there's no real large financial investment, so if it looks or behaves goofy, i'll just toss it in the trash. So, my husband buttons one end of the Tiedown, slides the Tiedown through the necktie's nametag (with the shorter necktie end tucked in also) and buttons the Tiedown at the other end. I would've bet money on the fact that you could see the edges of this 'cheap' tie holder or that the tie just wouldn't lie right.

Well, I was right. The tie crumpled all up and looked goofy--until we moved the Tiedown down one button. Then I had my husband stand up straight, lean forward, lean from side to side......... OMG.... I could not see the Tiedown at all, and the tie was completely well-behaved! We were thrilled with this new gadget! Hubby has worn it for a week--and has not heard one comment from colleagues about the 'unusual' tie holder. Because no one can see it!

I do have one suggestion though--they should be sold in packs of three or five--that way if one gets broken by the kids, chewed up by the dog, or lost by dear hubby, then you'll have extras on hand. So, in the meantime, by a few when you order! (I didn't realize at the time of this review that a multi-pack was available).

This is a product that will eventually be sold in high quality retail shops--get them while they're still so CHEAP, because once the designers get a hold of them, they'll crank the price up so high you'll think you're buying a slice of gold instead of plastic!! Trust me, I'm stocking up NOW!

Buy 'em. You'll love 'em"

Thiel ""John T.""","Astoria, Queens, New York City","The old standby for a suddenly wet and/or chilly windy ride is to wear a garbage bag.  It works but you would really rather be wearing a jacket that can be zipped and unzipped.

A decent cycling jacket costs about $150 more or less, but if you're a novice you don't need to blow that kind of cash, and this jacket will serve you fine.  Keep it with you just in case, and see the envy on others faces as they shiver in their lycra or suffer the sauna conditions of wearing a garbage bag to keep dry because they didn't carry this handy bit that easily fits in a jersey pocket or any kind of backpack without too much bulk.

Keeping the wind out alone is a big way to keep warm in foul conditions, while continuous riding will produce more than enough heat to keep you warm most of the time.

If you're heading out for, say, NYC's Five Borough Bike Tour in May, and don't know what to buy, your basics are: some kind of jersey--a CoolMax shirt will do; 6 panel or more cycling shorts with a chamois (pad) where the sun don't shine; light / thin socks (Air-e-ators are best); and one of these jackets.  These and a helmet and you're set for serious riding.

Skip the bulky layers for warmth.  If you want that bit of insulation you may need, get a $10 polarfleece vest from a bargain store, and one of these jackets. 

I take one star because it doesn't have vented armpits, but on second thought I probably shouldn't have in consideration of the price to value ratio"

""Needlessly Marked-up"" had a great quality robe, but the price was in the hundreds of dollars range. I then looked online, and was really tempted to buy a generic robe in the ~$65 price range, but I became leery when I found too many negative reviews complaining about the poor fabric quality. 

Hence I decided to spring for the Luxury Spa Robe. You should note that the exterior is smooth (microfiber) and the interior is the cotton terry.

Packer,,"Clarks Men's Falcon has been around for years, but it appears that the Company, in it's questionable wisdom, may be discontinuing the line.  It is very tough to find a retailer with Falcons in the size and width you need. This is very unfortunate as the Falcon is comfortable, durable, and ""smart"" looking. I became a fan of these shoes the moment I stepped into them - they require no breaking in period.  You put 'em on and you feel like you've been wearing them for years.  They are suitable for every day wear in less-than-business-suit-required work environments. The Falcon comes in brown and black suede with a leather upper portion around the side and back of the shoe. Many newer Clark's seem to be crafted with ugly thick soles, and an upturned front. A water-proofing spray can be applied to the Falcon without marring or significantly darkening its appearance.  If you can find a pair of these shoes, I recommend applying the water proofing - it'll add months of wear.   "

Not sure if the above review is even about the same jeans or not.
These jeans are very well taylored with added features all around.
The nicest feature is the gusseted crotch which is very comfortable!
 The back pocket trim and leather patch for the front pocket are nice.
 Very deep inside trim on the front pockets never shows!
 And the 5th pocket is very roomy and placed well.
 As for the ""baggy"" rear, well, I am like most guys, not having much to sit on and the seat fits me perfect. I'm average build. I think the descriptive pictures above shows this well.
 I have actually been stopped in the office by the girls to comment on how nice they looked. The kicker, my co-worker buddies have even asked me where I got them.
 These are very comfortable and well made. I hope Wrangler never changes anything about these jeans. They are made for men!
 You should try a pair! Not your average jeans!
 Want something really toasty for the winter? Check the Thinsulated pair of these jeans out. They are great as well"

Finally I started branching out and looking at different clothing styles.  Something that said ""me"" but didn't put me into any specific category.  I found that in hats with the Bailey Wool-Felt hat.

Its comfortable and because of its material, you don't have to baby it like some hats.  If something smashes it down, it can easily be reformed back to its original shape.  The hats style alone does not say cowboy or retired yuppie, but has more practicality to it that represents an adventurer or even just an ""average joe"" with class.  Its a working mans hat to wear to town, or a city mans hat to wear while relaxing by a stream after a day of fly fishing.  

Make sure to check the sizing chart if you are ordering online (I use my baseball caps, which have the sizing mark on the inside tag, as a reference) otherwise it might be best to try one on at the store and make sure it fits.  I like the way they have various sizes that encompass different exact measurements, that way no matter what, you'll find the size you are looking for.  I only say this because with baseball caps I've had trouble finding the cap I like in the pro back (non adjustable) size I need.

I found the drawstring a nice addition but not something I really needed as there are never to high of winds whenever I'm wearing mine.  A nice change of pace and a statement in simple style, the Bailey Wool-Felt hat is affordable, durable, and classic"

We ordered the same bag in 3 colors, one for each person. They look as if they will be very durable but we've only had them a couple of months.  only negative is that there is not a separate pouch for the ice pack.

Jockey Elance bikinis were the first I bought, and years later, they are still what I wear most of all. 

I've since bought many other styles (boxers, boxer briefs, classic briefs, thongs, and other bikini styles) and brands, but it's pretty much the exception to the rule when I wear anything but Jockey Elance. 

Contrary to what others have said, they are well made. I've had a number of them for years, and they still hold up. I also think they are really comfortable. Also, someone said they are knock off of women's underwear. Jockey made men's Elance bikinis long before they made ANY underwear for women. However, online you can generally only get them in black, grey, and white, which are ok, but not the most fun. You can get a wider variety of colors at department stores. Walmart sells them in a huge variety of colors as the Life brand. 

But a lot better than these are the Hanro Cotton Stretch brief, also for sale on Amazon. They are better made, more comfortable, but extremely pricey. You can buy about 4 packs of these for the price of one of those. "

Don't be afraid to wear these in public because there is enough fabric around the waist-band to let your pants sag and thus making it look like you're wearing regular underwear!  Nobody will realize what you're wearing!  Try these out!!

Unbelieveable! 
I am a ""newbie"" to the thong market after growing up wearing what my Mom told me to wear; cotton briefs (tighty whiteys). 
Consider me liberated! 
After going through my initial ""ordering frenzy"" of thong underwear (much to my wife's ""you're developing a mid-life thong fetish"" dismay) I happened upon these.
They are what I would consider a ""contour or pouch"" style thong and they are, hands down, the BEST OVERALL THONG I have ever worn! They have a cotton mesh pouch (sexy, but not really ""see-through"") that is the most comfortable ride my ""boys"" have ever had. 
I absolutley love them/live in them. 
The Brazilian T-back makes the support across the Netherlands all but unnoticeable while the stretchy sides provide frontal support and all-around comfort. 
Plus, check out the price! 
OMG! 
Anyone who's shopped for a name brand thong knows the average going price is between 15 and 25 dollars.
At 8 bucks, these thongs are unbeatable, and if you don't mind the color yellow you can own one for 5. Too good! 
I bought two of every color and am hoping they still make these when those wear out. 
It will be a sad day in the Underworld when these thongs become unavailable.
Attention atheltes; added bonus! These are comfortable enough to wear while running, jogging or working-out. 
The cotton pouch is softer than any jock I've ever encountered (while offering equal support) and the lack of those ""butt straps"" adds an easy 2-3 mph to my runs. 
Seriously (I'm sure it's physcological)! 
THESE THONGS ROCK. 
Plus, she thinks they are way sexy (bonus-bonus, nudge-nudge) as the pouch was designed and sewn by someone who knows something about the male anatomy and physiology (evoking ""Yeah, Baby, Yeah"" from the Mrs). 
Don't miss out on these - you'll be sorry"

These are the best shoes I've ever worn before. Period.

I have worn my pair for several years. I wore them daily while walking everywhere I went in Europe. Then I wore them daily while walking miles a day in the advertising business. These shoes have never let me down. The only thing I had to replace was the shoelaces - one time.

I never felt out of place wearing these shoes. Never did I feel that I was too formal in these shoes, nor too casual when meeting clients or attending formal dinners. My so called ""casual"" sneakers got demoted to strictly playing tennis after I bought these shoes.

As for the comfort, my feet have probably been spoiled because of these shoes. Even if I have to work 16 hour days my feet are still fine. For as much as I've worn these shoes and worked 80 hour weeks in them, the shoes still don't have an odor to them other than that of well worn leather (and it's barely discernable). I've never applied anything to the shoes, save for shoe polish.

I'm having to buy my second pair now because my first pair I've worn out after owning them for almost 5 years. The top of the shoes are fine, only minor abrasions are visible if I don't polish the shoes once in a while. It is the soles that are wearing out, I've worn them down to almost nothing.

I was very lucky to discover Bostonian and I believe I'll never have to hunt for comfortable shoes again that also look great"

Allen Greenbaum,California,"Orvis must employ some high-priced copy writers for their catalogues, because their customarily high-priced clothes need all the sales acumen money can buy (and perhaps Orvis passes their salaries on to you...). Hence, their 'why buy one pattern when you get get more' pitch. In any event, if you can't get a sale item that you like better than this at Orvis.com, you'll at least feel you got a halfway decent price for this thick, warm, and surprisingly good-looking sweater.  While not made in Ireland, it has that sheep-yarn-crofter-whiskey-handmade look, and you can lie about its origin with ease.  THe medium heft fits its design and function, and the colors coordinate well: You will not look garish or overdressed.

In short, it's one of their few patchwork type items that really works (another being the ""Irish cap).  For examples of this concept taken to a ridiculous extreme, look for the patchwork Madras, as just one example.  While you're at it, find the corduroy pants with the dogs on it. It's ""country gentleman"" on steroids; the Hamptons after a few too many ethanol teas.

But this is a good one...you'll like it. PLease note two things: THe back is not patchwork but a tan-beigy solid (that's ok), and while it's machine washable, it's best to hand dry it or dry clean to prevent shrinking and wear."

Both of which are Adidas and always match.  White/black Adidas sweatshirt = white/black head-band.  Red/white sweatshirt = red/white head-band, orange/white hoodie, orange/white head-band, etc. etc. etc.  At first it was out of practicality... exercising, etc. but with the head-band, well, the story behind that is that I was too cheap to buy a new set of head-phones for djing, and the speaker of the left side broke off, leaving it lose.  Great for djing, but the remnant of the plastic was rather uncomfortable right behind your ear.  So... I had a headband on one day and I got to keep using my old rag-tag headphones that I loved so much (I've since stopped being so cheap and got a new set).  As for why the Adidas hoodies - they're just so incredibly soft and comfortable!  I like them more than the Nike ones, and then I think they're just a bit more stylish.

This though is a great sweatshirt.  Very warm, very soft, and pretty cool clors.  I have the cream/red colored one and wear it loads - even though there isn't a matching head-band for it yet.  Drawstring's good, pocket's big... what more can you ask for?  A bit expensive, which is a shame because you know it will be $20 at TJ Maxx next winter.  But still, I like mine. "

 I really like the versitality of the various pockets and pouches, including the interior wallet, and the magnetic snaps hold everything together pretty well.  It is remarkably light, even with all my stuff in it. The color and appearance shown here are true to the actual product.

My purpose for buying these are for river tubing & general walking around on an upcoming cruise and I'm confident now that these will serve that purpose nicely.

The only downside to this shoe is that the sole doesn't look as nice as the women's version.  My wife got the same shoe but for women and her soles were clear while mine was black.  Nothing major, but hers looks much better than mine when looking at them both from the bottom (not that I'll ever see them from that angle while I'm wearing them)."

I also purchased the more expensive black CLAVA ID Holder/Key chain as a gift for a man. If color isn't an issue, stick with the less expensive.  The black was nearly double in cost and it is IDENTICAL in appearance and feel. I am very pleased with the green color. It is a dark green and is very nice. (It would have worked great for the man I purchased it for, had I known what the green looked like) I love this ID/Holder Key Chain bc along with carrying my keys with it, I can carry a lot of things inside such as my Drivers License, credit cards, insurance cards, photos, membership cards, money, receipts, etc. One of the inside ID holders also has a zipper pocket attached so you can also carry loose change. The ID holder also velcros closed, which is a nice feature. There is also one clear plastic pocket on the outside which works perfectly for displaying a photo of my children. I don't think I'd use the outside pocket to hold my drivers licence or another valuable card for fear that it may fall out and get lost. Also, I like carrying my keys with the ID Holder bc I don't have to worry about driving to the store and running in to realize that I forgot my wallet in the car or at home. I like the convenience of having it all together. This is a great buy! Especially for college students. I was first introduced to this style ID holder in college and have been using it ever since"

Duncan ""My Bones Boogie""",Oregon,"These are the best scrubs I have ever found. If I put stuff in a chest pocket, it falls out when I bend over. I'm a male nurse, and when I wear a scrub top with the two front pockets at the base I feel like I'm wearing an apron. If I put stuff in the back pocket of scrub pants, I sit on it. Finally, I found my solution...cargo pockets! I have to deduct points because with these pants I end up wearing so many pockets that I tend to forget where I put stuff. And if I run, anything heavy in the cargo pockets annoyingly slaps me in the legs (all scrubs are loose-fitting on my chicken legs). But then I gave those points back because of the ""coolness"" factor. Let's face it, cargo pockets make you look like you are ready for anything (even if I have learned how to minimize the amount of stuff I needlessly carry around). Like most scrubs, they're very comfortable. The new sandwashed material is very durable and stain resistant. I've washed them many many times and they still look like new. Dickies is a great brand and the one I'll be sticking with (unless Carhartt starts making scrubs)"

I decided to finally break down and spend the money on this belt and let me tell you, I ONLY WISH I'D GOTTEN IT SOONER!!! Like before I had the previous three kids!  :^)
    I'm not sure what happened with the person who wrote a bad review, talking about the band putting too much pressure on the hips...I can only assume that either she got the wrong size or was using it incorrectly.  I have found that I can't tolerate sitting for extended periods with the belt tight, my legs go numb, so I usually just take it off when I'm resting at home for the night.

Rea,"Milwaukee, WI","I am a physical therapist.  When I got pregnant, I was concerned about my back and how it would hold up during the pregnancy.  With the hormone relaxin that is released with pregnancy, our joints loosen up and can't support as much as they do in a non-pregnant state.  This is especially notable at the sacroiliac (SI) joint of our low backs.  Instability of this joint (there's one on each side) can lead to pain.  

At about 18 weeks I started having some SI pain.  I got one of these belts and had relief within 24 hours.  For about 2 months I wore it every day to support my SI joints.  I found that if I attached the velcro strap in the front securely, but not tight, then used the two side straps to tighten up the whole belt, I would get the best relief.  I had to be certain the two side straps were even: the seam where they meet in the back was in the CENTER of my back.  I would then pull them around at the same time and attach them so that the fit was snug, but not uncomfortable.  After a couple of months, the baby started getting so big that I started wearing it more as a support for my belly.  As I've gotten bigger and bigger, I've pulled the back part upward slightly, which continues to provide SI support but also helps hold up the baby.  When I take the belt off I REALLY notice the difference.  The support is amazing for such a simple belt (wish I had the patent!)

I'm due in a month.  I have had NO back pain since before I used the belt and I continue to work and exercise without problems"

Form fitting and soft, elastic is just enough to keep them on, they are everything you want in a pair of undies, but they don't last. I've been wearing bikini style for more than a decade and these are a good economical alternative to the brand that got me started, Calvin Kleins. The Calvins are the Shangri La's that all others strive for. But you got to pay. You only get one pair of Calvins for $15 and here you get 3 Hanes for $11. They are almost identical in feel, the difference is in the construction. The Hanes only have a single layer frontal sheild whereas most other bikinis will double that area up and for good reason. After about a year or so  your buddy downstairs will be busy making himself a little window and who knows what that could lead to. A door or a hatch and then he could bust out and take over. I suppose cost vs. longevity with the Calvins does balance out. They cost 4x as much but last 4x as long. But do our partners want us having the same pair of undies for more than 5 years?

I used to be a Saucony man but the Saucony shoes would feel flismy after putting some miles in them. With the Kayanos, after maybe a couple hundred of miles, they're still in tip top shape. I think they could go for another thousand more. 

Cons- the price is a little of a reach but I figured it was a worthy investment because of my marathon running. I feel the sole could use a little more traction on wet surfaces."

It even has adjustable hooks in the elastic band around the chest, so as you lose those Lbs while wearing this great top, you'll be able to adjust it to fit you as you slim down.  I'll never have to search high and low again.  I'll know exactly where to turn whenever I need a sports bra that will support my ""needs"".  Thank you Figleaves, you really have a great product.

My only complaints are: 1) The middle pocket - seen in the photo as holding a bottle of water - is a little deceptive.  This pocket does not comfortably hold a full-size water bottle, only a 1/2 pint bottle.  Had I known that, I might have ordered a larger size bag.

I emailed Crocs to ask if there was a way to stretch them out (because they're unwearable) and here was the reply from their customer service rep:

""The Prima is our one style that is made for looks and comfort. This style is not for everyone, and if they are not stretching to where you need them with wear, they might not be for you. There are only 5 holes in the top of this very slim fitting shoe, so how much air can get through there in the first place. I personally have no problem with this style, so I believe it depends on the person. If you are dissatisfied you can try to take them back to where you bought them and see what they can do.

Bolt,"New York, NY USA","I recently got a 15"" MacBook Pro and needed a larger bag to accommodate it (replacing my Manhattan Portage 1640 Waxed Canvas Messenger Bag, which I loved). I ordered and returned several things before settling on this. I am very happy. It is a durable, smartly designed bag, and pretty much a perfect fit for the MacBook Pro, stored inside of a sleeve case. 

At first I thought I would replace my Manhattan Portage bag, which was just barely too small for the MacBook Pro, with the bigger version of the same bag, the 1635. But that bag was WAY too big- the MacBook was swimming in there. This bag is a comfortable fit, with a little room on either side of the MacBook when the bag isn't too full. And there is plenty of room to carry a number of regular books (or whatever else) in addition to the MacBook.

 It also has an ideal number of smaller pockets - not too many, not too few - for storing accessories. For my needs, the pockets are intelligently placed and sized so I feel like there is a place for everything, and I don't feel like there are any useless pockets.  Most of the smaller pockets are inside the main compartment, on the side opposite the one that's against your body when you're wearing the bag. This makes them convenient to access while the bag is on. And one problem I had with the Manhattan Portage bag was that the smaller pockets were on the side that's against your body, so whatever was in the main compartment of the bag would get in the way of accessing the smaller pockets. Since these are on the opposite side, the pockets are easy to get to even when the bag is relatively full. 

One of the pockets has a key ring, but unlike some bags, this one is attached to a long ""leash"", so the keys can actually sit at the bottom of the pocket until you need them. They don't get in the way when you are trying to get other things out, but when you do want them, you just fish them out by grabbing the top of the ""leash"". 

A waterproof liner was an essential feature when I was searching for a bag (I'm paranoid about being caught in a downpour with my laptop), and although this one hasn't been put to the test yet, it seems even better than my previous bag, which always kept the contents dry. One problem with the Manhattan Portage bag was that when the flap was closed there were gaps at the top on both sides, near where the shoulder strap attaches. Although this bag has a similar design, it doesn't seem to have the same problem. 

I do wish this bag came with a shoulder pad for the strap, but that is my only complaint and I'm sure I can purchase one separately. And the price on Amazon is significantly cheaper than I could find anywhere else, so I can put my savings toward the shoulder strap"

I did not want one of those bags that had 50 different pockets because the more pockets you have the easier it is to misplace stuff and end up confusing yourself.  The bag is extremely durable as I have traveled the world with it and it has stood up to quite a beating.  Actually the bag still looks relatively new for how much abuse I have put it through.  I have never used it while biking but if you ever visit San Francisco, California you will see almost every bike messenger using this bag"

They're very comfortable and are holding up a lot better than my department store brand socks ever did.  (One pair of those had a hole after two or three wearings!)  They are definitely thicker than a dress sock, and slightly thicker than some casual socks, so if your shoes fit very tightly, these are probably not the socks you want.  They are not as thick as a heavy winter wool or hiking sock, however.  They are great with my casual shoes, though, and work very well with my work shoes.

I've been using my Lily Padz since my daughter (now nearly 4 weeks old) was a few days old.  (We had latch-on problems initially, so I used washable pads until my nipples healed.)  I really like this product.  It's smooth under clothing, and it clings pretty reliably.  It isn't perfect, but it doesn't claim to be.  When I have a gushing let-down, nothing will contain it, not Lily Padz nor cloth breast pads.  That's a little disappointing, but I suppose it's to be expected.  I only wish that the tackiness held up a little better.  I have tended lovingly to my Lily Padz, following instructions on washing and drying and what not.  In fact, I only wear them during the day.  At night, I wash them before I go to bed, and leave them on the domes to dry over night (using the washables at night).  Despite following the instructions on Lily Padz maintenance very carefully, I feel they've lost their tackiness, and I worry about their effectiveness.  So far, no big problems, but I'd feel more secure if they did not appear to have started to wear out already.  Still - they're totally worth the investment, and I may just buy another pair, so I can alternate and keep wear to a minimum"

No; not just the same brand but the very same two breast pads I brought to the hospital when I gave birth.  These things are the coolest things.  As long as you keep them clean, they will adhere to the breasts and stop leakage just as the description promises.  

Furthermore, these are also great if you are planning on returning to work while pumping/ continuing to nurse.  They are very thin and the profiles are smooth so you won't have to worry about that bulky/ obviously-nursing look which ruins many a beautiful blouse.

At first I had a little problem getting them absolutely clean but I then I used my body glove to scrub them while I was in the shower and voila!  I have not been tempted to write another review of any other products I have but I just can't believe more women have not discovered the wonder of these things.  

Another possible drawback is that the pads by nature don't allow for air circulation.  I suggest removing them for as long as you can for a few hours a day so the skin around your nipples can breathe... Removing each pad after a feeding works well for me but you will know what works best for you.  In any case; take a look at the price.  That's all I have spent on pads in 8 months.  What a bargain and an even bigger convenience.  Kudos to the makers of Lily-Padz.  A great shower gift too if you know someone who is expecting to breastfteed"

Marchant,"Salt Lake City, UT United States","I bought my fair skinned, red-headed husband one of the these shirts to have for a cruise to Mexico. He wore it snorkeling, swimming and SCUBA diving.  He loved it! It protected him from the sun. It dried quickly and looked good in and out of the water. It isn't as tight as the rash protection shirts so it wears more like a t-shirt but my husband preferred the more loose fit. The fabric is perfect for water. He even wore it on our cruise ship to dine at the buffet table after a swim since it looked so good. We liked it so much, we bought one for my father who also has fair skin. He said it was his favorite gift. If you need sun protection but still want to be active in water and sun, this is a great shirt to have.  You do have to hand wash it and hang to dry but I just soak it in cool water with Tide then rinse and hang. It's a snap. We're avid swimmers, SCUBA divers and snorkelers. This is one of our ""must have's"" in our gear box"

I bought the size 4 costume for my 3 year old and since it was a little big, I got different pants to match the navy blue shirt. I stitched on patches from the PD that my husband and I work for- over the patches that came on the shirt, though they would have been fine too.  I also sewed a little gold badge over the badge patch that comes on the shirt. I tucked a small flashlight in the holster and hung handcuffs out of his back pocket.  He was so excited to dress like us- daddy especially, and the photos are priceless!  Only negative- The handcuffs that come with the set are flimsy metal and appear they could cut a child.  I just bought a different cheap pair in a set with the small badge at a toy store. You can't go wrong with this costume- very authentic!

These are perfect in style.  The leather is decent quality for the price, and they look absolutely fantastic on*.  They are very comfortable.  I can't be any more pleased with the way they look and the feel.

The drawbacks, however, were disappointing.  I have narrow calves anyway, but these boots' shafts are so wide, they flap around my calves like sails.  I can literally stuff my fist in between my calf and the boot without stretching the boot.  The straps and buckles aren't adjustable, so I'm not going to be able to wear them with skirts as I had planned because they'll look pretty silly, like I'm stomping around in my grandfather's waders or something.  They are also very wide in the heel, even with socks my heel slipped up and down.

If you have very wide calves, or don't plan on wearing them with anything other than long pants, I can't recommend them enough.  Like I said, they are decent quality, well-lined, and they look great on.  I just wish I'd had warning about the width before I ordered them"

--- Update: 2 or 3 months after getting this bag, the leather which binds the shoulder strap to the main bag split, making the shoulder strap unusable.

This jean is the ""slim"" version of classic Cowboy Cut jean that Wrangler has been making since 1947. Among the Levi's jeans, the fit of this jeans is most similar to that of the Levi's 512,but it is cut slimmer in the seat. It doesn't have as much orange stitching as a Levi's, the back pockets sit higher. It has a zipper fly. The so-called ""rigid denim"" looks a lot like the ""shrink to fit"" rigid denim of the Levi's button fly 501 when new and will lose a lot of indigo dye on the first wash, but that's where the resemblance ends. The 501 shrinks about 10%, but the Wrangler shrinks less than 3%, because it is Sanforized. So, you should buy your correct size, erring on the side of slightly larger if you are right on the border.  

Compared to the regular the Wrangler Cowboy Cut, the this slim Fit is quite a bit skimpier. The slim fit seat is smaller and the legs are pretty trim--it's more of a boy's cut. If you are really on the thin side, it may work for you, but many men will find it too constricting in the waist and seat. 

Wranglers stonewash finishes are pretty mainstream compared to some of the more exotic things Levi's is doing now. These definitely are not so-called ""destructed"" jeans. You won't find whiskering or abrasion the way you will on the stonewash Levi's. 

Overall, these are very solid well-made jeans that offer a nice alternative to the more popular Levi's models. Like Levi's, they are well made and indestructible. "

It's extremely lightweight and it feels kind of like Tyvek. But here's the weird thing. The dang thing works. It doesn't have vents or pockets or anything but manages to keep the rain out and not get super condensed on the inside with sweat. It's the one rain jacket I took with me on my 2500 mile Canada to Mexico ride along the Great Divide. The first day it poured and this jacket did great. It's never leaked and I've used it a ton in rides around my home turf of the Pacific Northwest.

After 10 months of pretty hard use the jacket did develop some little tears and if you aren't careful you can rip the material. So for a day-in, day out jacket you might want something stronger and pricier like a Burley or a Showers Pass jacket (or Rainshield's pricer nylon O2 jacket) but at $35 this jacket does better than a lot of jackets costing 4 or 5 times as much. And it really is light and packs down very small, so if you're a minimalist at heart this is a great jacket for you"

Well, after three months of looking (offline, too), I was ready to give up. We're having a very small, relatively casual outdoor May wedding, and I couldn't find anything that really fit my idea of what I want to wear. Then I found Tension Dress (bad name!) on Amazon.

I bought the ivory in one size larger than I usually wear (XL, even though generally I'm a 12), since it looked like juniors sizing and I'm 5'10"". It fits perfectly (and since the back laces up, you have a little ""wiggle room"" in the fit). I'm planning to have it shortened to tea length (the only adjustment I'll need to make), but even at my height the full length is just right with a 2.5"" heel.

The fabric looks and feels nicer in person than in the photos on the site. I actually ended up ordering it directly from gojane.com's site, since they had more size and color options than were showing up on Amazon. Even with expedited shipping (I ordered it Sunday night, late, and it was here by Thursday afternoon), the total was less than $100. Not bad for a beautiful wedding dress! I couldn't be more pleased. And after the wedding, maybe I'll dye it and wear it for other occasions. Although at this price, I could even buy one in another color..."

I contacted the seller via telephone about 2 weeks prior to Christmas and was told all they'd do was send a UPS tag to me to send the products back for security tag removal.  I explained the time issue, that I'd ordered them in plenty of time to arrive before Christmas and that they likely wouldn't make it back to me in time if they went UPS ground to Florida and back to Oregon.  She told me that was my only option.  

I asked if it were possible to send them back and forth faster than ground and she told me it would be on my dime.  Since it was their error, I expected better, but didn't get it.

I also hated struggling with the kind you have to pull over your head.  The Natori one is great.  It comes in real sizes so I never feel like I've wrapped a rubber band around my chest.  It stops movement while I exercise, even running & jumping, without strapping down my chest.  It has a good shape that I even feel comfortable wearing it under my regular clothes.  I love that it hooks in the back so its easy to get in and out of.  The straps are wide enough that they rest easily on my shoulders and still provide support.  It wicks away sweat.  And they last forever! The only thing I've ever been annoyed with is the metal clasps for adjusting the straps because they fall right on my shoulder blades and sometimes dig into them when I do sit-ups on a harder surface. I definitely suggest this bra for any larger chested women who move around a lot when they exercise"

So...I went with this case. It's binder style, so at the very least I knew I would be able to organize pages easily.

This is a good case overall. The zipper seems good, the binder seems strong, but the handle is a flimsy piece of rubber stitched to the nylon. I bought this case is for storage and not hauling it around so that doesn't matter too much. 

 I filled it to capacity and to my surpise there is no room to add pages... Also, as with any large capacity binder, flipping pages is not a smooth action, you have to guide the page up and over, and it's hard to flip over any more than 5 pages at a time.

In Summary:
Pros: stylish, built well, good quality pages (the CD never has  to slide over plastic)

Cons: No room for additional pages, hard to flip pages, flimsy rubber handle

I did A LOT of shopping around for a CD case, I'm satisfied this case is better than all the rest I've looked at, but I just think it's possible for all these companies to build a better CD case"

The hoodie came with a place for my head and arms and the name hoodie is not a misnomer.  It had a fully functional and attached hood.  Studies show that we lose 70% of our body heat via our heads.  Well just put the hood up and you can keep all that heat.  Yes, with this hood you too can do your part to stem the tide of global warming.  If the hood is too big, well there are strings that are included that will allow you to close down the hood good and tight.  In fact you can go overboard and be your group of friends very own Kenny.  Mumble away in the warmth of a Russell Althletic Men's Logo Sweatshirt.  This pack also came with a t-shirt that had many of the same features as the sweatshirt.  It is a great way to show off your support for your favorite sports team or the sports team your state has made the ""only"" college that is acceptable to root for.

Johnson ""Queen Mother""",WA state,"I initially clicked on the infamous ""Live Wrong"" bracelet because I thought it was something my 26 year old son would think was funny and fun to wear.  I've probably only read three reviews in all the time I've been shopping on Amazon.  I don't remember why I started to read these reviews but once I did I was hooked.
I am 52 years old, fat but not a stupid moron.  I've lost 4 people that I love to cancer.  I am a cancer surviver.  I think these bracelets are exactly what they are supposed to be, funny.
I believe they are a personal statement, as is every other colored band that is sold.  What I think is wierd is the uproar this has caused on both sides.
The truly offensive people are those who feel they can judge a person by any bracelet, hat or car.  While I drive my SUV I wear no bracelets of any color.  I have taken the advice of D.L. Hereford and D. Ray ""conspiracy theory"" and send my chairitable contributions direct.  I contribute time as well as money to what I believe in and time slipping a bracelet on and off doesn't count.
I have a daughter-in-law who does relay walks and other fund raising activities while she wears her yellow bracelet.  I think she considers the bracelet less important than the rest.  I think Silent Bob would approve.
Brent Freakin' Wilson, your anger over this is way overboard.  I sense other personal issues.  See your pastor.
The emperor of ice cream needs to write a book, maybe he could call it, I'M SMART, SEE.  Or perhaps a Geraldo type talk-show would work better.  Then he could allow people to view his impressive intelligence first hand.
Lovestory 27, quite reading romances and grow up.  By the way, there are t-shirts that have money going to charitible causes, too.  Why allow the evil doers to put live wrong on a shirt? 
Doesn't anyone realize this is Amazon.com not a political forum?  All the bands, black, yellow, pink or aquamarine are more club membership cards than anything else, don't make them more important than they are.  I'm buying some!!!
I joined in on this damn thing, I am officially over the edge.  "

I agree that people should give directly to charities, but if impulse purchases at the checkout counter and the web lead to more money going toward charities from people who wouldn't normally directly donate, I'm all for it.

Shirley ""Laurie's Boomer Views""","fountain valley, ca United States","I bought this DKNY Short Sleeve (V-Neck) Tee over a year ago, and liked it so much, came back here today to put a couple more of different colors in my cart. They  cost a little more than a year ago, but they are a very good quality and have lasted through many washings. 

They are very comfortable,light weight and fit loose around the ab and waist area, which I prefer to something clingy. The fit is short, but not too short, hitting just below the waist. I wear it often, and found it versatile enough to wear with low-cut jeans, for sleep, yoga and working out. The color(grey) did not fade much with all the washings, but I did find that, after a while, it lost it's shape just a little and sometimes it came out a little wrinkled from the dryer(dried on low), but usually smoothed out by hand when I folded it. It did not wrinkle during wear(except when I slept in it) and it did not shrink at all.

I liked the loose  fit, the comfy cool feeling of the fabric, and the quality enough to order a couple more for the hot summer coming up. I usually wear a large in most tops, but I usually go for an  X-large in short tees, so it just hits a little lower and is a little looser.

And by the way..""Bare Necessities"", the store I purchased this tee through, was very good with packaging and prompt delivery.

It a great buy...Happy Shopping...Lauri"

These units are GREAT. They fit very well, they hold the 'pod solidly  in place and they're strong. We've both used them exclusively since they arrived. 

There is one quirk that I'm experiencing by Hannah isn't. I may have to try one of the other colors to see if it's just the one I selected or a design issue. The ""tab"" that holds the two shell halves together protrudes slightly and when the 'pod lies flat on a surface, this tab tends to pop open. The one I've been using loses it's tension over a matter of days and the unit pops open unexpectedly. 

I'll try a different one to see if this is just a quirk on the one I've been using. I'd also likely file the protruding tab down by .040"" or so to help prevent the ""table contact."" These things are good enough that it's well worth my effort to examine the engineering and find solutions. 

However, in the overall, I find these to be really excellent covers for our use and style."

Last year I bought a pair of the Reef Fanning's which integrated a bottle opener in the heel.  Well, this year they took it one step further and integrated a flask into the heel.  I love these sandals.  Not only are they comfortable, with or without liquid in them, they also have the added flask function.

Of course, it's mostly for novelty in my case because it's not often I need to carry around 3 ounces of liquor in my shoes but for those times when I do, or just want to for fun, it's great that I can"

I don't mind it. Actually, as a refugee from NYC (which post-9/11 and the Bloomberg anti-Smoking Nazis is not half the brazen City it once was), I chose Utah because of the snow, the mountains, the free & easy gun laws, fewer people, and skiing. But what I don't dig is the Arctic temperatures, especially because I have an evening cigar outside every night, and it dampens the delights of cigar-smoking to have your face and eyeballs freeze. 

What to do? 

I took a page from the strategy-book of Chiapan Revolutionary & mask-wearing bandito SubCommandante Marcos, who wears his hairy woolly black face-shrouding balaclava wherever he goes. I dig the SubCommandante; dig his style, dig his stature, dig his designer AKs, dig his Listening Tour about the country taken on a black motorbike, a kind of 21st century homage to Che. Dig all if it, Comrade, you know? 

But what I dig most of all is his ability to light & smoke his stogie through the little mouth-hole in his black balaclava. He does this all the time: there's SubCommandante, with his stogie, and he's got it sticking out of the little mouthhole, puffing away on it merrily. 

So I figured: if it works for El Jefe down in Chiapas where it's 105 degrees in the shade, it probably will work wonders for me up in the mountains of Utah, where it's 5 below zero beneath the moon? Ya venceremos! 

Sure enough, I'm digging it: I can go outside, smoke my cigar to my heart's content, and have a toasty face that doesn't freeze & splinter in the subzero frore winter blast. All well & good, even though after a few heady puffs the little mouth aperture gets a wee tad bit stinky, but oh well, that's what a washing machine was made for. Also, the ski-mask is well made, solidly sewn, and no doubt would be awesome for a cold-weather counterinsurgency. 

That said, there is one big drawback: every time I wear the thing, I have an urge to carry out guerilla warfare against the bourgeois pig McMansion owner over the fence.

Secondly, I was attracted to the general style of these shoes, which when worn with long pants gives the appearance of a pump without flying of my foot like pumps do. The crowning feature of this pair was its five inch heel. Therefore, for style and color, I would give this shoe five stars. 

Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the way the shoe balanced. It required a lot more concentration to walk in than most five inch heels. This is due to its very thin stiletto heel. Also, it is rather painful. Albeit, most five inch heels are very painful. Therefore, I would not recommend wearing these shoes for extended periods of time, nor on slick surfaces. Luckily, the clasp on the top of the shoes did not dig into my leg, as I expected it would. Overall, I would give these shoes a three star rating as far as comfort is concerned. 

I have ordered items from this seller numerous times and have been very pleased with them. They ship quickly and their items are always good quality. I highly recommend them.

Messier,MA,"     I go thorugh a lot of shoes.  Basically, other than the winter boots and summer sandals I wear the same pair of shoes everyday to work and after.  Ken Cole has made a great pair of shoes.  I normally stay around $60 for each pair, so I went a bit further and it was definately worth it.  Hold these oxfords and you can instantly see the quality put into them.  These will last for a long time!  As far as comfort, the gel soles in them work fantastic.  The leather does take a little bit of wear before it forms to your foot, meaning the top edge around the ankle (especially the heal) rubs into you for about two or three days.  This sometimes happens with any new shoe.  Anyway, I would definately buy again"

* Not a drawstring waist.  Not an elastic waist either.  The waist is the same type of stretch seam as the legs, so be mindful of which opening is which when putting this on!

* Fully lined, front and back, with light skin-tone 100% polyester.  The shell is labeled as given in the product description: 78% nylon, 22% Lycra/elastane/spandex.

* Because of the polyester lining, this isn't a competition (i.e. very stretchy, very tight) suit.  Go ahead and order your regular waist size, you'll get a recreational fit.  Remember, there is no drawstring or elastic in the waist, so be cautious about jumping a full size upward.  36"" is a Large, but 34"" you might go Medium instead.

* Wears fine as active underwear, with no visible seams under running tights, and no discomfort during ""dry"" workouts in the gym or the great outdoors"

Crabtree ""Photographer/Public Assitant""",Ohio,"I just got these sneaks recently.  I am going through the wear-in phase of the shoes.  So these opinions are based soley, no pun intended, on my time with them so far.

Originally I had gotten a pair of the Jordan Hoops Low.  I loved the style and got a good deal on them.  Well, I found out that 13 in Jordan is more like 11 or 12 in other shoes.  So I had them returned for a 14. I got the 14's and they were long enough..just not wide enough.  It was then that I found out most of the Jordan b-ball shoes are pretty thin width.  

I told the guy that I am willing to look at what they have in the store to just get something that I can try on.  I ended up trying the KG A3 and they felt nice.  I tried on these T-Mac 6s next and they feel better than the KGs overall.  The KGs felt better on the heel, but that was the only place.  Everywhere else, the T-Macs are more comfortable and it is the perfect width.

Just on the shoe...they are hurting my feet just a bit..but that is common for me for the break in period.  I am overweight and flat footed so it takes a while for me to get my shoes comfortable.  They are also warm inside. I am just wearing normal cotton socks right now, not my new Jordan dri-fit socks which wick better. I notice that there are no ventilation holes on the the shoe like most have.  None on the toe area..none on the tongue..and none on the sides.  There is also no meshy fabric to help ventilation either.

One thing I worry about is the ""stability system"" on the bottom of the shoe.  Long term..it seems like it would be like the Shox system.  My local shoe expert says he gets many returns for Shox that have been torn or worn at the Shox part prematurely but never had any T-Macs back yet.  I guess we will see"

I have been using custom shoe arch supports for the past year due to lower back problems. I usually purchase other brands of shoes with size 11 wide(2-4) The T-Macs come in regular width so I purchased size 12. They fit great. I now have four pair of the T-Mac Series and I can wear them comfortably without the arch supports. These shoes have style and comfort. Can't wait for next line of T-Macs

They look absolutely marvelous on, and are so comfy, like wearing a big, soft bedroom slipper.  They are very warm and also waterproof, so they can withstand most any kind of weather.  I almost always wear an 8 in boots, but in these, an 8 was way too large.  This boot does run a little roomy.  So, I got the 7.5 and am very happy with it.  One caveat:  these are not lightweight boots.  The pair weighs a little over 3 lbs. which is slightly on the heavy side for long walks, but I don't plan on walking miles in them.  For looks and weather protection, they can't be beat.  In the picture, the foot looks slimmer, but they have the wide-foot look of a mukluk style.  Still, the cute fake fur tops make them very stylish.  Also, the suede straps around the boot are for looks only--  don't try tightening them.

I've been hooked on wayfarers style since the Blue Brothers were the 80's equivalent of the New Kids on the Block, but the price can be prohibitive.  There are cheap knock-offs out there at low prices, but the quality shows in the cloudy eyepiece and dull plastic in the earpieces.

Not so OC Shade's Classic Wayfarer Sunglasses.  The quality is virtually indistinguishable from similar brand name styles at many times the price.  I was so pleased with my initial purchase that I've laid in a small supply of these sunglasses, stocking up on both smoke/black and tortoise combinations.  

Some people have complained that the glasses are smaller that similar big name brands - not so.  I've uploaded a picture of the OC shades compared with a similar big name brand that cost me over $100 - I defy you to tell the difference (well - if you know where to look for the obscured logo, you can figure it out!)  But, other than that - there's no difference.

I advise you to buy as many pairs of these glasses as you have people in your household who wear (and lose) classically styled and great looking shades.  Preferably before OC Shades realizes that they're sitting on a gold mine and raises the prices"

Considering how many times I've paid more money for sunglasses that were worthless junk, I'm more than happy with these.

The lenses do produce a slight amount of blurring, and some slight halos around bright lights.  But again, less than the average pair of sunglasses.

The frames are of the rigid variety, which means you can't twist them unmercifually the way you can some newer frames without breaking them.  But they are exceptionally strong and have a very solid feel to them.

I'm going to order a few more pairs of these to put away, so that when the first pair wears out, I know I can replace it"

There was never a break in period. I normally wear a 6.5 shoe, and these felt a little big when I first tried them on. However, when I tried on a size 6 shoe, I knew that was too small. I ended up buying the 6.5. I just wasn't used to having a shoe that fits AND allows me enough toe room to wiggle my toes. Merrells are great for people who need a little more room in the toebox, but who don't have feet wide enough to move to a wider shoe. These shoes are not waterproof, so you will need to treat them if you plan on hiking through wet weather. I recommend the purchase of insoles after you have worn these shoes for a few months. The insole they come with is rather thin and doesn't offer a whole lot of support. Overall, if given the choice, I would happily buy these shoes again. I would also say they run true to size for most people."

I find it hard to find jeans that fit me right because I have a small, well-defined waist but more generous hips, buttocks, and thighs; most jeans that fit my lower half have a large gap at the back of the waist.  When I tried these jeans on in my usual size, 8, they were a bit too tight, but when I went up to a size 10, they fit quite well.  There is a *slight* gap at the back of the waist when I wear this jeans, but because the fabric has a hint of spandex, they fit my body well enough to wear without a bit.  The spandex also makes these jeans extremely comfortable; they hug my body nicely without feeling the least bit tight.  I also love the low rise, which falls an inch or two below my belly button, just where I like it, and the boot cut, which gives my short legs a wonderfully long, lean look.  I'm just shy of 5'5"", and the 32"" inseam is a bit long on me, but I prefer my jeans on the longer side these days, so the length seems just right.

Quality:  The robes are very soft, medium thickness and fluffy.   The stiching is well done.  Nice tag inside stating made in Turkey.  

Packaging:  Arrived in a plastic zipped bagged, nicely folded.

Size:  We are both a normal weight range 5' 6"".  These are a one-size fits all robe, so,  as always, they are bit large, but we both like them that way.   The sleeves reach to my knuckles, but the stitching is such that the robes look finished even with the cuffs folded back.

Chance,"Fernley, NV",I went through every brand of running shoes .  I am tall and have a large frame and I tend to go through running shoes rather quickly.  When I discovered Brooks about 4 years ago it was Heaven sent.  Yes these shoes are expensive compared to others but you get your moneys' worth and hey spend money are your feet! We abuse them everyday.  They suppport my whole foot and I have not lost any toenails as with others.  I now run for fitness and not races.  These shoes last me about 6 months.  So if you are in searching mode I HIGHLY recommend these shoes.

Definitely the best shoe purchase I ever made.  These are by far the most expensive shoes of any kind I have ever bought, and they were totally worth every penny.  In fact I bought a second pair of this same model because the first one was so good.  Normally I'd get five pairs of running shoes for the price of these two. (I'd love to get these at a deep discount, but just haven't found them anywhere.)

They take a lot of wear and tear.  I have run and walked well over 1,000 miles in these shoes and they are still practically like new, just a little worn in the center of the front sole.  Which is doubly amazing considering that I weigh over 250 pounds.  Usually I blow out a pair of shoes after just 300 or 400 miles.  

Aside from being slightly warm they are amazingly comfortable.  I can wear them all day at work, or for a fifteen-mile walk, and not have any discomfort.  The fit has been perfect, and usually that's a problem area for me.  These are snug without binding, and have all the right support in the right places.  No appreciable wear has occurred on the interior lining of the shoe.

Brooks has been a very good brand for me, and these are far and away the best of their line that I have tried.  Compared the best stuff from New Balance, Asics, Saucony, Mizuno and other good brands that I have used, The Beast is on a completely different level"

I was instroduced to the brand a few years ago while working in an Amazon warehouse where I walked 10-20 miles per day picking customer orders.  I haven't purchased another brand of walking / running shoe since then.  

The Brooks Beast Running shoe provides the best support of any shoe on the market.  I have flat feet with no arch support, which makes it more difficult to walk on hard surfaces for long periods of time.  This shoe makes the task so much easier.  Honestly, it's the best, most comfortable shoe that I've ever owned -- AND it has a fresh, hip design that those of us in the MTV generation can wear with pride"

I bought this style pantyhose in tan and I like very much how it looks on my legs and thighs when wearing a dress or skirt.

Huculak,"Tulsa, OK","I just bought this item and am quite impressed with it. I bought it because it conforms to most airline's carry on requirements (It's 41 cubic inches). 
I was worried when the box arrived because it was only 4 inches thick--I thought they sent me the wrong pack because it was so thin; I would find out, however, that this is part of the genius of the design. The bottom of the suitcase is flexible, with the wheels-side acting as a pivot-point. Thus, if you do not need to fully pack the case, it will remain ultra thin. If you pack more, the bottom folds out to accommodate the material. So, if you are only going on a weekend trip, you will have no problem putting this under the seat in front of you. If you pack more, it will easily fit in the overhead bin on the aircraft. The zippers are thick, there are lots of pockets for toiletries (so it's easy to pull them out at security in their little plastic baggie) and documents, and it seems to be coated with plastic to make it waterproof. The wheels are also well-placed and are made of rubber (which makes them quiet and sturdy), but the handle extension bars could be a bit thicker; however, I'm tall, so I appreciate that the handle extends to a comfortable length, which allows me to walk without having the thing bump up against my feet all the time.
So, it's a well-designed, nifty little carry on that I'm quite happy with"

Most importantly, the bra supports and yet has smooth lines under silky clothes and the front dips below the waist so you don't have that sausage roll effect where the abdomen bulges when the bra stops.  Another plus is that it comes with clear straps you can use for extra support.  I only have 2 negatives.  First, I believe the ad said it came with both clear AND straps to match the bra but when it arrived only clear was included.  (I didn't pursue this.)  However, the biggest negative is that the cups are not just lined but padded.  I personally find that makes the bra less useful and can even disturb the lines of some clothing.  Sometimes less IS more"

They fit well under anything I wear, don't twist and become uncomfortable - causing me to stop everything to adjust them - when I'm doing physically twisting things. They don't climb up my legs like other brands do.  They stay where they belong. I feel like I'm being embraced by a warm fluffy cloud when I wear them.  They retain their original  softness even after many washing & machine dryings.  They don't snag, run, or get stiff & uncomfortable, and they keep my body very warm, but they never feel damp or sweaty.  These are far above all other brands, but are not as costly as most of those inferior brands.  I threw all my other thermal underwear in the garbage, where they belong, after trying Lady Morgan's thermal underwear.  Excellent price for an excellent product!  I highly recommend Lady Morgan's thermal underwear for anyone living in a cold climate.  I'm willing to bet that the men's version preforms equally well.   "

It does not show under clothing.  This particular bra defines each breast separately and the cups gently mold to each breast.

The straps are fairly narrow and are cut in a ""rick-rack"" fashion.  They can be adjusted by moving the back hooks closer in or further out.  The one disadvantage this bra has is that when putting it on, the straps sometimes come out of the slot where they are hooked.  You sometimes have to readjust them 2-3 times when putting it on.  Once on, this bra will certainly define you and give you a nice shape and uplifted bosom.  In fact, you could think of it as your bosom's buddy.  An excellent bra"

Pathfinder Carrier: Apparel,apparel,16 of 16,5.0,Great carrier but should have skipped the sun shade,"September 18, 2005","Displaced Yinzer ""mom to the Tadpole""","South Bay Area, CA United States","We've had this carrier for 7-8 months and have only used it to go hiking - our intended purpose - a handful of times.  We used to go backpacking a lot in our childless days and I would not say this carrier is quite as comfortable as the pack I used for that (a Gregory) *but* then again my Gregory pack has always just ridden quietly on my back and doesn't throw its weight around and yell in my ear.  I think the wiggle of the cargo accounts for the difference in comfort, and the difference is not that big.  Still, I have never hiked more than 6 miles with my kid in this and I can't imagine going much further than that.  I'm willing to admit this is due more to my going soft than poor pack design, though.

We can fit all his diaper supplies in the attached backpack if we use disposables, tie a few toys off the loops on the carrier, and stuff a sippie cup in the holder in back, and it makes for a nicely contained baby unit for a day hike.

What I have found this pack to be unexpectedly great for is to use in place of a stroller where strollers are a hinderence - such as historical sites - or for walking around the mall or grocery store.  My kid has reached this point where he hates to ride in the shopping cart and tries to climb out, but for some reason he is happy as a clam riding up high on my back in this pack.  Generally happier than when in the stroller, even.  Never fights to get down.

My husband and I can both use this pack comfortably.  I am about 5'4 and use the pack on the second from the smallest setting; he is 5'10 and uses it maybe 2 settings bigger.  I think there are about 8 settings in all so this could certainly work well for a wide range of people.

From a kid perspective, my boy is about 30 pounds, 35 or 36 inches, and he's riding with the seat in the middle (of 3) adjustment.  

The only thing I don't like about it is the sunshade/rainhood, which is included with this model but makes this model more expensive than the next model down, which I think is called the Journey.  We just never use it because it wigs my kid out so we should have saved the money.

I also looked at REI's child carriers, Baby Trend, and a lower priced Kelty (Base Camp, I think?) and the suspension just didn't compare.  The Pathfinder line is just much, much more comfortable.  I don't even understand why Kelty puts out carriers like the Base Camp.

My only regret is not having gotten a frame carrier sooner.  I overestimated at which point he'd be ready for one"

Menchaca,"Austin, TX, United States","I've been using the GT-2000 series shoes for about 2+ years now, and I can honestly say, they're the most comfortable running shoes for my build.  This is one of Asics best, if not the best, selling shoes because it offers such a wide variety of fit for most foot types.

These shoes are mainly designed for the moderate to heavy over-pronator (when the feet roll in too much) with low to medium arches, but I've met fellow runners with the same shoe who have medium to high arches.  I, myself, am flat-footed, but use orthotics.  This can be a major problem for me when buying shoes because I need something with a wide enough heel to allow my orthotics to fit, and these work great.  Don't worry if you don't have a wide heel because there is memory foam embedded in the heel that forms to your foot over time.  

The heel and forefoot also offer a good amount of stability and support.  The shoe is designed for medium to large builds, but again, I've come across other runners who are much lighter and use the same shoe.  When I first began running, I weighed 300+ pounds, now at 216 pounds, the shoes still work well (I've bought newer version of this shoe as I've worn the others out).  

The ""Upper"" (the top parts of the shoe) are really comfortable.  It's made of a mesh material that allows a maximum amount of air and circulation into the foot, while allowing all the heat, moisture & sweat out.  The shoe is so comfortable, you could easily run in it without socks (which I have done only a few times).  

The 2000 series are versatile, they're well priced, and they come in a variety of sizes, widths, and colors, so chances are they'll fit you.  This is by far the best running shoe I've used up to date, and would recommend it to anyone who is just starting or a long time runner."

The case adds additional grip to prevent it from slipping out of my hand and protection should I accidently drop it. "

In dim light they look black because the burgundy is very dark.  They were a little tight at first and took about 3 days of wearing to break them in and to not rub the back of my heel.  (I don't have a callous there so any small amount of rubbing causes great pain.)  But once they broke in they turned into fantastic shoes.  They have great toe room - I can freely wiggle my toes and there's no rubbing on my little toe.  I'm going to buy a pair in black now. "

They are very sturdy and a great value considering many discount stores sell shoes that are higher priced for less quality and that is if you can find the shoes. These are absolutely the best combination of good value for the money.

This bag is very large and accomodating of all your needs, male or female. It is indeed very roomy and I would classify it as a daybag or travelbag because it isn't as limited as most ""lunchbags"", but still great for days at the office. For those of you that are troubled by coworkers ""borrowing"" your food and drinks from the company refrigerator, your troubles will be over with this bag. Tons of room to include cooling packs to keep at least a long day's worth of food and drinks chilly. The top of the bag has a seperate section that will hold all your other daily needs, whether it be reading material, including full size magazines you won't have to roll up or to fit in, medications, keys, cell phone, PDAs and what have you. The other compartments will accomodate you further. Conveniently, there are compartments where you can keep things hidden, so that personal items or valuables don't have to be displayed at any time, unless you choose to do so. This bag appears to be really well made, nothing cheap about it or ill planned. The zipper pulls alone tell the story, large, heavy and solid, accomodating for the smaller hand all the way up to very large men's hands. The stitching appears to be very well done and not prone to come apart easily. The dual handles at the top will allow for carrying with one hand, or clip on the adjustable strap for a more hands free tote. The thickness of the insulation is more than adequate, much thicker than most of the off the shelf type insualted bags, it is what you would expect in a premium bag. The fabric is quality denier that looks like it will be able to hold up to heavy use and easy to wipe clean, like most denier. I would not be surprised to see a flight crew carrying this insulated tote, as it has the style of simple elegance that you usually see with their carryons, suitable for even a daybag phobic male, but sleek enough for a woman to feel as though she hasn't just joined a brown bagger construction crew. This bag doesn't look out of place in the office or at a worksite, the beauty of classic neutral design for the causual person or professional. It has enough capacity to work for a picnic bag for several people. My mother was eyeing it for use to carry all her copious amounts of makeup on her trip to Vegas, with keeping all of it cool in mind. That plot didn't succeed, it has not yet seen Vegas, but nice try mom, lol. The sticker shock for this bag may seem high if you are used to throw away bags from mass retailers, but this is a worthwhile investment for those needing quality and more space. Overall value very high and more than worth the money. Hey, just what the coworkers swipe in a month's time might pay for the whole bag by itself."

Ryan,"Winthrop, WA United States","I have 43 years of hiking, backpacking and peak bagging experience. In recent years I migrated, like most people, from all-leather European-style mountain boots to lighter fabric/leather combination boots. They seemed to work well for a while but two years ago I started experiencing significant pain in my toes, instep and heel. I concluded that my lightweight boots from a well known outdoor supplier were a contributing factor, if not the root of the problem because they didn't provide sufficient torsional (side-to-side) rigidity.

Danner's advertisement for the ""Terra Force"" boot support system convinced me to buy the Radical GTX two years ago.

The first thing I liked about the Radicals was the roomy box toe area that eliminated occasional rubbing problems caused by my prior boots' smaller toe box. There was also plenty of instep space for my high arch. Unlike many boots that now come in a single width the Radical's multiple widths allow a wider fit in the ball of the foot while retaining the snug heel fit that prevents blisters.

The Terra Force torsional support has not diminished after 250+ miles of hiking. Besides day hikes and 2-3 day backpacks I've used the Radicals with good results on off-trail scrambles to summits in the High Sierra and North Cascades, occasionally crossing snow steep enough to require an ice axe. Despite offering much more support than my prior lightweight boots the Radicals are hardly heavier (my size 10.5-EE's weigh 52 ounces). Best of all, after switching to the Radicals my toe and instep problems ceased almost immediately, and my heel problems have gradually diminished substantially, all of which I attribute to the superior support of the Terra Force system.

In my opinion these boots have too many seams and different pieces of leather and fabric, but I'm not marking down my rating because that's how virtually all lightweight, relatively inexpensive boots are made these days"

Also, it was nice leather that you know will become butter-soft.  Unfortunately, I needed a wide shoe (a 9 triple E) and it wasn't even close to being wide enough, so I had to return it.  So, all-in-all it looks like a great slipper, but if you are a wide foot person, it may not work"

The quality of the beanie is great; it looks like it would last for a long time, and I really like its looks.

And I do have a decent sized dome (7 1/2 in fitted hats).  But this lid fit my one-year-old son's head better than it does mine.  It kind of sits on my head like a yarmulke, barely covering my giant bald spot.

So if you're concerned at all about it being too small, it probably is.  If you've got a smallish noggin, this would probably be a sweet beanie"

This is such a comfortable bra and molds to the bosom so well and minimizes so nicely, that it is truly a great pitty the cheap plastic hoops and strap fasteners break apart and ruin the bra so you can't wear it anymore. Also for large sizes the bra would be perfect if it had softer straps and a wider band and more rows for hooks in the back. This could be one of the world's greatest minimizer bras if Bali, the manufacturer upgraded it as stated. Unfortunately the life of the bra is too short to make it worthwhile buying because it just falls apart. "

My old ones are getting tattered so I needed some new ones.  The bra offers good shaping and support.  My only beef is that one of the three bras I ordered squeaks.
