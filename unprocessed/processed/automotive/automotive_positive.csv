I bought two pairs of wipers just over a year ago, expecting I'd have the second pair as backup. I haven't needed the second pair - the first pair are still just like new - they don't squeak, chatter, or smear and are great for visibility. I live in Seattle, so it's not like I never use them either - we've been deluged by rain in the last year!

The only thing I can think is that maybe others are mistreating their wiper blades. Keep your windshield clean, and if the wipers are smearing, just wipe the cleaning edge off with a paper towel from time to time. That's not a problem with the blade, that's a problem with the cleanliness of your windshield and blade. Any wiper blade struggles when it's bogged down with dirt, pollen, and road grime.

I figure eventually I'll use my backup pair, but until then I'm happy"

The LED came on and the controller sent the power to the battery even in low cloudy days with no sun.  I saw some hype online about MorningStar's 'SunGuard SG-4' (& it's PWM) and it's fancy line graph showing how it was far superior to other controllers. Bought one for $27.oo and $11.oo shipping tacked on from another vendor), swapped it out with this SUNFORCE 60012 Controller hoping for a big improvement. Waited for morning... and put my volt meter on the system only to find the SunGuard SG-4 (with NO LED) was still sound asleep! Zero volts passing through it! So I immediately removed the SunGuard SG-4 and re-installed the SUNFORCE 60012 Charge Controller I purchased here from Amazon. Poof... back to producing 12 Volts from my solar panels and the hazy sky had no sign of sun. The SunGuard SG-4 is now on it's way to the local landfill... and the SUNFORCE 60012 has a permanent home in my home solar power system. Sunforce's LED is glowing and the Solar 12 Volts are flowing to my battery again. Stick with the SUNFORCE 60012 it is far superior and WORKS like it's supposed to. Call me old-fashioned... I think that's why I bought the SUNFORCE (& the 'SunGuard SG-4' ~ 4 amp w/ No LED )in the first place? # SUNFORCE 60012 7 amp Charge Controller #: Low price and High Quality and it actually does what it's supposed to do!

Tomaszewski,"Chicago, IL","I was a bit skeptical about buying this product because of the other products I have tried that claimed to be spot-free and failed   miserably.  I was pleasantly surprised with the Mr. Clean AutoDry system!  If you follow the directions and put a bit of effort into your wash job it works very, very good!

- You first rinse off your vehicle with regular, unfiltered water either through the AutoDry gun or with your regular hose sprayer.

- Next, you use the AutoDry on the ""soap"" setting and completely cover the vehicle.  They advise to only use the Mr. Clean soap, of course, because it contains agents not normally found in other car washing soap that assists in the sheeting action (similar to Jet Dry for the dishwasher)

- Thirdly, you give the vehicle an old fashioned hand wash with a sponge.  Make sure you do a good job and clean it completely or you will find streaks when it dries with the old dirty water smeared all over.

- Fourth, rinse the vehicle completely with unfiltered water.  Make sure you are very through in this stage.  Take your time!

- Finally, set the AutoDry to the filtered rinse setting and go over the vehicle again.  Make sure you start at the vehicle's highest point to remove all the tap water sitting on the roof.  Basically, you want the filtered water to remove all the unfiltered water.  Spray the filtered water in all the crevices to avoid spots later (side view mirrors, bumpers, etc.)

Although it sounds like it takes a long time it is really quite quick if you put some effort into it.  I can do a complete vehicle (Ford Explorer) start to finish in about 15 minutes.  The car dries completely spot free EVERY time!  Of course, the results will only be as good as YOU make them.  If you don't wash completely or rinse the unfiltered water off completely there WILL be spots.  It is up to you to do a through job to get great results"

It uses a 3/8"" drive but it doesn't ""snap"" onto the wrench so it can fall off easily.  As long as you are careful, you shouldn't have a problem and it will save you a lot of time when changing your oil filter.

The prongs can be adjusted by holding onto the ""base"" and turning the socket with a wrench.  The prongs rotate around the base depending on the direction you turn.  The way it works is that at the widest position, turning in either direction will cause the prongs to ""close in"" on a certain direction.  That way, as long as you have the prongs closing in on the proper direction, when you are trying to remove an oil filter, it will grip harder as you turn counter-clockwise.  If you have the prongs closing in on the wrong direction, then turning counter-clockwise will actually widen the prongs"

O'Neill,"Baltimore, MD","I have had this awesome little device for about 5 years now.  In that time there have been TWO attempts by car thieves to take my car (a Honda Civic).  

The first attempt it looks as though they saw it and moved on (door was open, things shuffled about).  This was while it was parked at my school in the midst of a string of Honda Civic thefts (there had been no less than 10 thefts of modified civics in the past two months--which is what inspired me to buy this).  Given the context of the situation and since nothing else was taken or disturbed, the only logical conclusion is that they were after the car itself.

The second attempt was by a much more aggressive would-be thief.  This one worked at the clutch lock for a good long time.  When I got to my car the next morning, the clutch pedal covering was broken off and the pedal bar itself was bent slightly off to the right, however the lock remained solidly in place.  They even broke into my trunk to retrieve the tools to try and pry it off.  They had no such luck.  The pedal cover was replaced for $10 and all was well.

I would trust any car to this in any situation.  Certainly you should use an alarm as well, and be conscious about where you leave your car, but this is a fantastic deterrent.

This unit will hold a charge but needs to be maintained (recharged) at least every 60 days or so. 

 

NEVER charge via the cigarette lighter adapter in your vehicle longer than 3-4 hours.  It may be left on AC charge indefinately.  It is better to keep it fully charged, discharging this unit will result in shorted cells.

 

All in all, a very small price to pay for peace of mind, at home and on the road.  With a power inverter (less than $20.00) you can have silent power source for lights, cell phones, small tv's, laptops, flourescent lights, etc."

There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding from what I have read in other reviews. Let's clear a few things up.
First of all, you do NOT have to wait ten seconds between readings. You DO have to hit the recall button on the bottom between readings.
Secondly, you DO NOT have to send the unit back to replace the batteries. The instructions VERY clearly state the model number of user replaceable batteries (if you were to read the instructions).
The hose was flexible for me in 30 degree weather contrary to what I have read elsewhere. Maybe it gets stiff in really cold weather but then I use mine in the garage.

With this gauge, you can overinflate your tires a little bit, then bleed the air out with the valve til you reach your desired PSI.

Assuming this lasts a long time, I would recommend it to everyone"

Barto,"Santa Monica, CA USA","Jan. 21 Update:  I got the low-battery indication while using the gauge, and it turns out that the LR1130 batteries are alkaline, not lithium as both the product packaging and instructions say they are.  The batteries are indeed very easily replaced, and I'm replacing them with the silver oxide equivalent (SR1130W), as the original batteries apparently weren't the freshest (although they were Hitachi-Maxell).  I continue to like this gauge very much.

I think this is a great product at a great price (currently $35 total), and I just bought a 2nd one to lend so others can see for themselves (don't want to be without mine in case it doesn't come back).

Very simple to connect and take a reading, and when bleeding air the numbers drop with the drop in air pressure, so I can reach the exact pressure I want quickly.  The batteries are user replaceable, but they are lithium (LR1130) and are expected to last more than several years (the packaging suggests they will last the life of the gauge, as ""permanent power"").  The gauge can be zeroed (recalibrated) simply by turning it on without any air pressure in the hose, confirming that the display reads ""0.0,"" and waiting until the display goes off (20 sec. when no pressure is present and 60 sec. when there is pressure present).

While the gauge display reads to a tenth of a pound, the actual stated accuracy in the instructions is plus or minus 1 percent plus 0.5 PSI, which suggests that the real accuracy is within about 0.2 to 0.8 pound, which is still better than any other gauge I've seen or used.

The instructions explain things well enough (they read as though they were translated into English, but still completely understandable), and the listed Web site for the actual manufacturer, Measurement Ltd., Inc. (in New Jersey), provides contact info. for user inquiries.

I like using this gauge (it's quick and easy), and that makes maintaining my tire pressure at the proper level simple to do consistently (along with a good portable air compressor, like the TyphoonMax TX-500, which I also really like)."

I wish I knew about this product earlier!,"October 10, 2006","T. Tom ""Mediahound""","SF Bay Area, CA United States","You can trust that this item works well and does not scratch your paint. I was always skeptical previously and just asssumed these things scratched the car. But my paintless dent removal guy uses one and highly recommended the California Duster to me. He is fanatical about keeping his car totally detailed. And this product works so well that he never even washes his car unless it gets rained on. He just dusts it every morning before he backs out of his garage, and if needed he uses some liquid instant detailer and a microfiber cloth after dusting if he feels like it. It takes a total of less than 2 minutes to dust off an entire car, yet the result makes your car look like you just washed it. 

I use the California Duster before putting on my car cover so that there is no dust between the car and car cover. If you have a garage, it's quite useful since dust settles on the car during the day when you are out and about and at night, even garaged. You won't have to wash your car as often if you use the California Duster. And dust won't build up if you use it often enough.Before discovering the California Duster, I found that after washing my car, I could only use my car cover for a few days before the car got too dusty to put a cover over. Now I find that I can keep the car dust free and use the car cover for much longer, which in turn means I don't have to wash the car nearly as often.

I got the plastic handle California Duster which was significantly cheaper at the time I ordered. Although the wood handle one looks classier and probably feels nicer, the plastic handle one feels plenty sturdy, for the value oriented, get the plastic handle one since it's the exact same brush anyway!

I am really very happy with what I paid for the Calfornia Duster and would not hesitate to recommend one to anyone with a car or motorcycle. Just be aware what it is not made for a car that is wet or very dirty. My only complaint is that it is not actually made in Calfornia"

For me it seems like a parabolic shape because the height continues to increase slightly up to around 18"" in the backside. With my 6 backlog boxes in place there's still some 26""x36""x5"" of room above them.

Material seems to be strong, the only think I don't like is the zipper wich seems to be regular one not one intended to support strong wind force. Well, in two weeks I'll tell you what happened with this bag during my 600 mile trip. 

So far, so good"

The only draw back is that the positive and negative leads are very short (thus, 4 stars). When I jump a car battery I like to hook the negative lead up away from the battery to avoid spraks and a possible explosion from battery fumes.

The soap doesn't foam up like it would if you were bucket-washing, but it gets the car just as clean.

Another plus is you don't have to wash your car with a bucket full of dirty water. The super-fast jet spray setting is not that useful for me, but I'm sure you off-roaders would appreciate it.

I follow the procedure as described by Mr Pruss and end up with little or no water spots.  You do have to pay particular attention to any nooks where unfiltered tap water can accumulate and but sure to flush them well with filtered water in that last step. Failure to do so may end up with a trickle of unfiltered water running down the car as it dries.   I also echo the complaints about the soap compartment cap and lack of a good on-off trigger.  With the really hard water we have in So-Cal, I get maybe 8 vehicles washed on one filter cartridge.  I find it takes about half the time to wash my car and truck with this system vs drying by hand.  One other observation: the soap compartment has a line for maximum fill.  I got the impression, the time I accidently went way over that line, that a little soap was being dispensed along with unfiltered and filtered rinse water.  Or maybe soap was just oozing out of the contraption and getting into the rinse water that way.  Otherwise, I'm surprised how happy I am with it"

Well, the Mr. Clean AutoDry Met expectations, though it does have a couple flaws.

I've owned this product since it first hit the store shelves, after a very hyped up Television marketing deal... I figured that if I bought it at Target and it does not work to my satisfaction, Target will give me my money back. I tried it, and it worked perfectlly. I knew from prior experience that de-ionised water will not leave spots as it is the ions of molecules in the water that are left behind when the water molecules evaporate. Remove those ions and there is nothing to be left behind. I was a little sceptical that such a small filter would work well, however, but for the most part, it has worked acceptably, but as the unit has some flaws, I should list them...

Flaw 1) The soap filler cap was badly designed. If there is any soap left in the unit when you store it, you have to be sure to store it so that the cap is upright (it is on the units side, not the top), else you will find a puddle of congealed, semi-dry soap when you pull it off the shelf a week later! There is no work around for this except to remember to store the unit upright, or lay on the other side.

Flaw 2) lack of a trigger for flow control. The unit uses a VERY peculiar flip switch which is a little difficult to flip on and off easily. It's not terrible, but a trigger like a garden sprayer would be SO much better!

Flaw 3) The hose connector does not turn freely... As you walk around the car, the hose twists and the water pressure tries to twist it back... This might be limited to the unit I purchased, but either way, it has been quite annoying. I found a perfect work around for this, though it did cost me a few extra dollars. I bought a hose quick disconnect that spins quite freely. it was a little expensive ($6, but works better than any other I have ever tried, and I simple screwed one end onto the autodry and the other onto the hose, and got some extra sprayer connectors ($4 each) for the other spray heads I use, and it's all good.

Other than the above three flaws, I am quite pleased with this product, and use it routinely. I can wash my car in about 30 minutes, and I am quite particular...

Here is the procedure I follow:

1) I quickly rinse down the whole car to get any dirt wet.
2) I then spray a section of the car, usually starting with the roof, with the soap
3) using a super soft, laundered wool wash mitt, I gently ""scrub"" the soaped area, and quickly rinse with unfiltered water, and ensure that the entire car remains wet.
4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 for other parts of the car (i.e. hood, trunk, sides, etc.),
5) Using the filtered water, starting from the high points of the car (i.e. roof) and working down to the sills, I completely rinse off the whole car and then let it dry, sun or shade. I've never had any spots whatsoever, except when the filter turns brown (which indicates the filter is exhausted)"

It also saves me time. Max's problem may be his whole process is flawed I never read the directions that may be how the product tells you to do it, however all I do is simple.

Wet the car (in my case truck) down with the regular water then wash the car,truck from the top down I use a microfiber towel and have the towel in one hand and the MrClean autowash in the other. I wash with soap and rinse as I go around the car,truck.
When it is all washed down re-rinse with regular water from the top down, change to the filtered water and rinse again from the top down. I do this part rather quickley it sprays just like a spray paint gun. then just let it sit and dry.

The reason I only give the product 4 stars is. The seal cap on the soap compartment leakes in storage if you dont prop it up just right or lay it on its side. And they really needed a trigger for the water controll, on and off.

I had used this all last summer im sure I washed my truck at least 20 times. and my water filter still worked fine. It may be my process and how fast I get around the truck or I may have cleaner water then what they say as only 10 washes per filter. I am back here to get a new one, beacuse I had kept it outside and well I cant expect it to hold up to a hard freeze can I? heh"

I just received the unit this week and immediately hooked it up.  You should set your engine size, fuel type (gas/diesel/hybrid), units of measure, and your fuel tank size - rounded down to the nearest whole number to allow for the best accuracy in the scangauge.  It's a simple installation.  Just plug it into your vehicle's OBDII port and choose a suitable mounting location that doesn't interfere with your other gauges or present a safety hazard.  (velcro strips are included for no muss/no fuss installation, but you could devise a more permanent mount)

Depending upon the parameters that your vehicle reports, here are some of the things this device can show you:

4 sets of trip data is stored - Current Trip, Today's Trip, Previous Day, and Current Tank.  In addition, fuel economy, fuel used, maximum coolant temperature, distance, maximum rpm, drive time, maximum speed, average speed, distance to empty, time to empty, and amount of fuel to empty.

The digital gauges are for fuel economy, fuel rate, digital speedometer, tachometer, manifold pressure, battery voltage, coolant temperature, intake air temperature, engine load, ignition timing, throttle position, and open/closed loop.  You can display any choice of 4 of these digital gauges on the gauge screen at one time and it's easy to cycle through them.  Not all vehicles will report every one of the above parameters through the OBDII interface.  If the data is not available for the chosen gauge, then there will be no display.

The final thing that this gauge is useful for is to read and reset trouble codes and your ""check engine"" or ""service engine soon"" lamp.  It captures the conditions present and stores them in flash memory if a trouble code is thrown so that you can review what state the various gauges were in when the trouble code triggered.

Again, I just received this item this week, but did quite a bit of research on it before purchasing.  I am very impressed by the amount of information the ScanGauge makes available.

Instructions not obvious that you must remove the red strip that protects the batteries.  Also not obvious how to get to the batteries, whatever they are, but I'll figure it out.  I may try another reviewer's idea to bend it 5 degrees for easier access thru the access holes to the valve.  Gotta use it a bit longer first.

Pelham,Maryland USA,"I bought this tire gauge specifically to check the tire pressure of my F350 dually.  The factory installed steel extenders made using pencil type gauges or other digital gauges impractical, particularly for checking the inner and outer rear tires.  Even though this gauge is sold for 'dual rear wheel trucks', I had to bend the steel tube about 5 degrees so it could make solid contact with the inner tire inflation stem.  Once it was bent, the gauge worked perfectly!  NOTE: I had friends at a machine shop bend the steel tube for me, it was too stiff to bend by hand or in a vice.  The gauge has big digits that are easy to read, even without my cheater glasses.  The air release button on the handle is convienent to use - even though I first thought it was for the display.  I have found it best to test the pressure, add more air than needed and then slowly release it using a combination of the button and disengaging and reengaging the gauge and testing until you get the desired tire pressure.  I found that if I failed to disengage and then reengage the tire pressure gauge, it tended to give me the same reading without resetting.  The guys at the garages always 'OHHHH and AHHHH' when I open the case and pull out this impressive tool.  It was well worth the money and Amazon had the best price of the various sites I visited while price shopping.  Oh, yea, I had to cut the plastic case a tad to allow for the bent tube to properly fit in the case so it would close"

Expensive (Amazon much cheaper), sure, but it goes on pretty thin, so the bottle should last a while.

It was really easy to put on and remove. I used a cotton applicator to put the wax over. It hazed over immediately and just a little pressure was needed to get the wax on the car. I didn't have to rub hard or anything. I waited just a minute (probably not even necessary to wait that long) and buffed off with a good microfiber towel (the Vroom stuff from Target worked great). I really shouldn't say ""buffed"", because I didn't have to press all that hard--the wax came off with light to moderate pressure.

I found this quite a bit easier to apply than the Meg's NXT wax.

The wax looks great. It has a deeper look to it than most pure synthetics, but also has some good shine to it. My car has a darker color and it added some depth to it. I applied it to my friend's black car, and it looked pretty wet.

It does have some cleaners in it, so it removed whatever fillers I had in my last wax and exposed the swirls a little more. If you are bothered by your car's swirls, you might want to consider a carnauba wax, as it will mask them better than this one.

I've had it on my car for 2 months now and the water is still beading nicely. I doubt it will last much longer, but I think that 2 months is not bad for a half-synthetic wax like this one.

Is this the top-of-the-line best-ever wax? No, but it DOES look great, and it is easy to apply. So I recommend it to all my friends who hate spending a lot of time on waxing their car"

Dodson,"Arlington, VA USA","Most people agree that U-locks are one of the best ways of locking up your bicycle.  I agree with that assessment, provided that there is something strong to which to affix the lock.  Whatever you lock your bike to, it has to be at the right height and of the right shape in order to be accessible by the U-lock.  I have seen many bicyclists in the DC area use their $100 U-lock to secure their $3000 bicycle to things like street signs, wrought-iron fences, rusty pipes, and even wooden park benches.  Street sign poles, which usually have a line of holes running down them, are designed to give and break away when hit by automobiles.  A thief could easily bend and break the street sign pole to get your bike.  I recently heard from a friend that their bike had been stolen because the thief merely pulled the loose pole from its decaying cement base.  A coworker's bike was stolen when the thief lifted the bike off the top of the pole after removing the bolted-on street sign.  Wrought iron fences can be easily broken by being kicked or leveraged at the welding points.  Rusty pipes, well, need I say more?  The point is, bike racks aren't always where you need them, and you can't always find something the right size to use your U-Lock on.  At two of the job sites I ride to for my work, the only things I can lock my bicycle to are gigantic street light poles.  The New York Chain was the only truly secure way to lock up my beloved bicycle.  The versatility of the chain is the best part about this locking system.  When I do use bike racks, I just either wrap the chain a few times around the bike or the racks, or I fix the lock to links that are closer together on the chain - easily accomplished if you pull the black sleeve back.

Now for the only complaint I have about the New York chain:  It is heavy.  Really heavy.  The first ride I took with the New York chain, I just threw it in my messenger bag and strapped the bag diagonally across my chest.  The weight was so lopsided that I felt myself leaning away from the bag just to improve my balance while riding.  For the first time ever, I used the twin shoulder straps that until then had been tucked into their pocket on the messenger bag.  Even then, the weight was enough to leave red chafe marks on my shoulders that evening after my ride home.  Maybe younger riders can handle the weight, but I'm a little further on in age and it is a bit much.  If your waist is skinny enough, you can wear it on your waist like a belt.  I tried it that way and if you put the lock in the back or on your non-dominant side it isn't all that bad.  But my bicycle touring experience tells me that this is one of those items that you should really carry on the bike if at all possible.  I don't recommend the handlebars - makes the steering sluggish.  The top tube is okay, but the lock has a nasty habit of swinging into your knees as you pedal.  Eventually I had to start carrying a laptop computer around for work, so I got a luggage rack with panniers.  Throwing the chain in the panniers was definitely the easiest option.  When you're not carrying anything else in the panniers, the trunk bag is an even better place for it - the weight is higher on the bike, yes, but it is centered.

Overall, I like this lock for its versatility in locking options, allowing me to lock my bicycle to anything large and immovable.  I think this is the best way to get the highest level of Kryptonite security.  However, if bike racks were more abundant in my area, I would gladly give up the extra weight by getting a standard U-Lock"

Olmstead,"Los Angeles, CA","Finally got to try this item out when my wife and I did some bar hopping a couple of weeks ago.  We delayed our drive home until the device gave us the all clear.  Of course the big question is whether the readings were accurate and without a calibrated reference device on hand, this currently remains unanswered.  Indirect evidence (our known consumption rate, body weight, and subjective feelings) suggested the device was in the ballpark.  Since I do have access to a more accurate (and far more expensive) tester at work, I may attempt some experiments and will report back the findings here.  

The device is very easy to carry around and is quite unobtrusive. Glancing at it, one would assume it is just a keyless entry.  And it is definitely at a good price point.  Since these type of devices are a great aid in being a responsible drinker of alcohol, it would likely benefit society at large if their use became common.  It should be remembered, however, that one can still be cited in most places while driving when BAC is above zero even if the levels don't reach the most serious DWI/DUI standards so having a designated driver still remains the best option.

So I visited a number of local stores to see what my options were. I settled on the Yakima BigHorn 4 as the best option for my budget, then discovered through some online searching that I could purchase the next model up, the Yakima KingPin 4 bike rack for a bit less than the BigHorn 4 would run me in a traditional retailer.

The KingPin 4 folds features a fold-down mast, a must convenience to allow access to a vehicle's rear hatch or door. Although I would not consider a bike rack without this feature, be forewarned: once you lower the rack while it's loaded with three bikes (more about the fourth bike claim follows), you will be hard pressed to single-handedly reposition it and slide in the lock or bolt. There is too much weight on that pivot point. 

I soon learned, therefore, that it was easier to have the mast folded up, not down, when loading the bikes. 

The dual bike arms are a must, allowing for more stability and easier loading and unloading. The bike arms fold down as well, though this option, while useful, is not essential in many cases. (These folding bike arms are the main difference between the KingPin and BigHorn racks.)

A series of bike cradles and rubber ""chainstraps"" stabilize and anchor the bikes. You can slide theses cradles along the tubular arms to allow sufficient room to avoid any rubbing or scraping if you are carrying three bikes. (I looked as some less expensive racks that required hand-tightening one or more big bolts to tighten clamps that held the bikes. That system seemed like a royal pain and huge annoyance.)
 
Despite the name and billing, I'm less confident in recommending the KingPin4 for transporting four bikes. I think it's possible, but would require great care to avoid scraping paint or entangling pedals and spokes. Plus, I prefer using four ""chainstraps"" per bike for a bit of insurance, so if you want to carry four bikes, I would recommend springing for another set of these. 

The unloaded contraption weights about 32 pounds, so it's not too heavy as you carry it from the basement or garage to install it. But be careful of the arms or you might shatter the glass in a door or an outside light. Also, you need to do a bit of assembly out of the box, so allow a good 30 minutes to set up and test the rig before using it the first time. The drawings in the instructions did not seem to match what I was actually looking at when I had everything before me on the floor, so I spent an extra few minutes considering the options. This assembly is not difficult---it's just that adage ""never do anything for the first time"" may stump one for a bit.  

I am using this rack with a two-inch hitch, and I purchased a locking pin to replace the bolt that is shipped for attaching the rack to the hitch. I also run one of the cable bike locks through the bike frames and around the spanner between the arms to add a measure of security. 

During our first foray, a 100-mile trip each way, the bikes and rack swayed just a bit from time to time, but overall, the sway was not a problem. Having a hundred extra pounds jutting up behind the rear window will change any vehicle's handling and hamper visibility through the rearview mirror, so be prepared to change your driving style as needed. 

To conclude, the KingPin 4 has performed well. We could load and unload three bikes in about five minutes, and neither the Durango or bikes were scratched during transport. But, again, I would suggest that this rack is great for three bikes, but may be a challenge for carrying four. "

Installation took atbout 1/2 hour and it works just like it advertises.

I couple of things.  I agree with the need to place the solar cell within a couple of inches of the garage door light.  I have a sears craftsman with a flourescent bulb which is enough with the solar cell right above the light.  There is a pressure stick pad that holds the solar cell onto the garage door opener.  There is a black 3-4 foot wire (looks like an RCA audio wire and plug) that connects the solar cell to the laser beam generator which is maybe about 3/4"" long and about 3/8s of the inch wide.  It too has a stick adhesive to be glued onto your garage ceiling.  The laser pivots easily so it can be aimed.

The actual beam emits a pulsing red dot not bigger than 1/8"" wide onto your dashboard when you drive under it.  It takes a little getting used to a first to know what to look for when you're parking.  My garage ceiling is about 2 feet above the roof of the car so it's pretty close to the laser generator.  If you have a higher ceiling, the mounting is probably harder but the dot is maybe slightly bigger.  The one thing that I have to adjust is that my wife is shorter than me so she sees the beam alittle later than I do and has to sit up a bit in the seat to see it on the dashboard of our Toyota Sienna which is a little flat.  I need to re-aim the laser to an easier to spot point for her since this is her parking slot.  

Works like a charm - just wish the dot was little bigger to make it easier to spot when you pull in.  Great feature not to have any batteries or plug ins required"

Set-up was very easy although the person who wrote the instructions clearly did not have a full understanding of the subtle nuance of the English language.
The idea that the unit is solar powered (driven by the garage door opener lights) is simply brilliant. No batteries to replace, ever.
Aiming the laser was tricky in my case as both cars in the garage are jet black and my idea of beaming the laser on the car was abandoned after discovering how difficult it was to see the laser light in the black finish.
I settled for finding a spot to shine the laser (it creates a red line)on the garage wall and I would be able to drive the car forward until the line dissapeared from sight. That would then be the ideal stopping point. This worked well with only one problem I did not discover until nightime. 
Driving into the garage with the headlamps on washed out the laser marking and required that I turn off the headlamps before docking.
With all this little issues, I still think this is very handy little product and I have had no problems with the way it works. Once aimed, a little loc-tight or nail polish on the screw for the laser head mount is probably a good idea as a slight movement of the beam after you have developed a strong trust in using the laser light as a guide could potentially result in thousands of dollars of repair to home and auto.

I have basically forgotten that these are in my helmet, the setup is seamless.  The wires fit perfectly under the padding in most helmets and the female connect is then attatched with velcro to the underside lip on the side of your helmet, so when not in use you really don't notice it.

When you need it..reach up and connect your music male connector.  Piece of cake!

The only downside is that it's not very loud at it's loudest setting with my MP3 player.  Not sure if that's a fuction of the speakers or the player.  It's loud enough to enjoy though"

Lee,,"Been using Mr Clean AutoDry system for a while now.  As long as the filter refill is not used up (stops deionizing the water), you'll get a nice sheeting effect when you rinse the vehicle off, allowing it to dry spot-free.  The thing you have to remember is that this isn't a pressure washer, or anything other than a system.  You have to wet the vehicle, wash with the system's soap, and then rinse with normal water.  When you're ready to dry, use the filtered water, and then let dry!  Best if you wash your vehicle in a shaded area, or the soap/rinse water will dry leaving spots.

The only negative I have with it is that it doesn't last very long when you've got a full-size truck and a minivan that needs washing.  After 2-3 washes of my vehicles (total, not each!) the filter doesn't deionize as well.  But sure does make drying much easier on these big vehicles!  No more hand drying for me"

After adding air to 2 tires the rubber inside the nozzle was already ripping and becoming unattached so that it would get in the way when trying to connect it to the valve stem, after 4 tires it was very ripped up.  2. The compressor vibrates so much that you can't put it onthe ground while running or it falls over.  I guess that's the price you pay for the light weight of the compressor.  While the rubber seal is a concern, it's not enough for me to return the compressor because it did work.

This charger, on the other hand, works very well, and it's a great value. Lots more power, charges up efficiently, and has solid all metal clamps. You do need an extension cord with a small enough female end to charge it, but that's easily found.

BTW, aside from the obvious uses of this product, it's nice to have the male-to-male cigarette lighter extension cord.

I've tried it all: the garage bump, the stop light type system, etc.  You mount this unit on the ceiling and point it to a specific point on your car so you know where to stop.  In my case, I point it at the dash.  When I enter the garage, the laser turns on and because the laser is very bright, you can follow it as it tracks along your hood.  If you set it up right, this helps you set the distance between your cars or the side garage wall. For example, you can set it to run only the seam of your hood or the middle crease if you have one. Then when it reachs the dash, I watch for it to land in a specific area and stop.  A successful park, usually with only an inch or two variance.  It so rocks"

I wanted a higher capacity unit, but with the same solidly built reliability I've experienced with my old Shumacher charger. This unit was priced quite a bit less than some other brands with similar capability, so I was a little afraid Schumacher, like many companies, might have gone the ""cheap"" route with their products by using a lightweight case and cheap components. Not so! I was pleasantly surprised to find this is a solid, heavy, well built charger in the best Schumacher tradition. Well designed with a very stout plastic cabinet with pop-up carrying handle, informative and easy to use front panel controls, and nice features like automatic no-spark battery connecting/disconnecting even if you forget to unplug it first, plus automatic polarity protection, and a looong power cord with a handy place to store the cord. I found only a single minor negative:  If I had to change anything about this unit, I'd find a quieter fan. The fan, although it's pretty loud for it's size, is at least automatic and only runs when needed, so this is no big deal to me, since I only run it in my shop/garage. Haven't tried the ""start"" function, which I consider a more or less useless frill for a charger of this size, but it certainly charges all types of batteries like a champ, and the automatic quick charge/maintenance charge function works great.

The principle of operation is simple: the photoblocker reflects back the light from the camera flash, the smoky lense deadens some of that reflection but obscures it (like a polarizing sheet)making it even harder to read than with the photoblocker alone. Also, by itself, the lense will make it a little harder to see your numbers in daylight. By law, your numbers must be visible but there is no scientific minimum so anything you can do to inconvenience the cops will benefit you. 

FYI: photoblocker works because the traffic cameras need the flash. It is all about shutter speed. To capture a clear picture of a moving object --obviously, you are racing through a stop sign-- you must have a flash. If you tried without the flash the shutter speed would be too slow to catch anything but a blur. By sending a pulse of reflected light you cause the photo to be over-exposed. One of the makers of the traffic camera says that all they have to do is re-develop the picture. Perhaps, but I seem to remember you would need to develop two pictures and put together the photos. This seems like a lot of trouble for a police department and may even require re-programming the software for their digital cameras. They probably won't bother: there are lot of people without counter-measures and the cameras costs them a fortune anyway.

When we got to Phoenix, I noticed that the front part of the bag had frayed and a hole formed.  I think this was more do to the straps that were hanging and hitting it than poor craftsmanship.

I recommend this bag if you are doing a short trip, but not for long haul trips with a lot of highway driving.

It found the problems on both cars within a couple of minutes and reset the errors.  The Honda had a ""proprietary"" error so I installed the database software (extremely easy to install) and looked it up (extremely easy to use).

Turns out both cars had non-critical problems and I could just reset the errors.  This would have cost me $150 at my car maintenance shop.

This device also functions as a pollution control system diagnostic tool.  I haven't tried that yet but it will be interesting to see how that works.

I have used mine for years though I did wear one out after about 80 uses airing up four large truck tires from 12 psi to 35 psi through a 150psi, 2.5 gal tank.  

I have it hard-mounted in my Jeep.  It pressurizes an air tank which is connected to chucks at both ends of the Jeep.  I start the compressor near the end of the trail and by the time we stop the air tank is at full pressure.  Then I connect a hose to one of the air chucks and start airing up tires.  

The compressor runs into the tank and the tank feeds the hose.  I can usually air one tire up in about 30 seconds this way.  The compressor doesn't catch up with this makes it much easier to work - everything is up out of the way and all I have to manage is the hose.  In between tires I can stop to talk and let the compressor fill the tank again.  Or I can air up the next tire.

This unit will not last forever and does not like to be handled roughly.  I have only handled the plug once - to plug it in when I bolted it to the Jeep permanently.  So I don't have the plug problems.

It is noisy but it is the sound you want to hear when you need air.  I remember one night helping a friend who had a flat. They were very grateful to hear that sound and see their tire come back to life.

If you want an industrial strength unit, you are going to have to spend several hundred dollars.  This unit keeps up well with an ARB compressor that costs four times as much.  Treat it well and it will treat you well"

I was able to pull the DTC's from my car, see what it meant (I had one DTC that turned on the CEL), then I was able to read what the sensors were seeing at the time of failure, as well as a great deal of engine data from the ""Freeze Frame Data"" function. The live sensor data function works partially for my car, again, this is a function that may not work on older cars. The advertisement leads one to believe that this will work for all cars - be aware of this. It can print the results using the USB cable that comes with the unit. The printing function can be enhanced by copying the displayed data into the clipboard and pasting it into an editor program (like Notepad). I found this to be a better way to print the results. The software on the CD is VERY basic - not much help with the codes. There is a LOT more data available on the internet.

The tool is easy to use and easily connects to and from different cars. Some of the advanced diagnostic data that it will capture is not easily understood unless you get some detailed instructions from the car manufacturer.

Here's what I like about it.  It sprays on smoothly and gets off the surface dirt.  (You know, the green pollen that is falling on my new car this time of year?)  It wipes off easily with a paper towel or terrycloth. Also, it leaves the car smelling great.  

It is only used on the car's exterior.  For the rest of the car there is a whole line of Meguiar's products.  I also bought the leather cleaner and car shampoo which I will review later.

So for all you guys and gals who want the car looking terrific in between washes, I highly recommend this product. "

I only paid $95.00 for this product and I can get the same O2 sensor for $150.00 online.  I saved money the first time I used it and the tool paid for itself.

In addition, I can use it for any of my friend's and family's vehicles.

Dent King can do some jobs, but not all. For what it does, it's a pretty good product. If you fall into the category where it can help, it's worth it.

It's a ""do it yourself"" dent repair kit for your car. It ""pulls"" dents back out and is a fairly good solution for dents that ONLY require pulling ""back out"". This includes door and shopping cart dings you'd get in a parking lot. It has to be minor, no larger than a grapefruit, and only cosmetic dent damage to a metal panel where there is NO crease. It does not address scratches.

The ideal dent for the Dent King to repair is damage from a blunt object, like a rounded plastic corner of a shopping car dinged the middle of your door and left an indentation that is small, did not cause creases, not on a crease.

I think this is but one tool of an arsenal of tools that body shops use. That means, it is only applicable to a specific type of damage. If the dent looks like it just needs to be ""sucked back out a bit"", then the Dent King probably can help.

Clean the surface with the included cleaner, which smells like regular rubbing alcohol. Use the supplied glue gun and special glue sticks and dab the melted glue onto the end of the ""puller"" stick and adhere to the dent where you want to pull it. Allow it to cool, then straddle the ""puller stick"" with the 2 point brace/bridge, and screw on the tightener to the puller stick. This will pull on the dent via the stick until the glue pops off. This action ""snaps"" the dent out a bit; depending upon how much force the glue was able to supply. This relies on a good paint job (OEM), as it's essentially pulling on the surface of the paint.

It ends up you will need to do this multiple times to slowly work out the dent

I can still see my dents but they are greatly reduced; that is, for the ones that the Dent King could be applied to. I don't think ""good as new"" will ever be achieved with Dent King, but it definitely can reduce ""ugly ding"" to ""little annoying ding"".

This is one of those products that is just a tool, and really is more dependent upon the skill of the operator. For the price paid, it delivered  value for its cost. But that's it"

This product is wonderful. Take if from me I have been detailing for years and this exceeded my expectations. To be applied over any wax or sealant will not haze when applied and is extremely easy to buff off. Requires minimal effort at all it's like running a microfiber towel over your car it's that easy. I found that it works the best when applied over Liquid Glass which is a polish that carries a lifetime warranty on their product. You can find Liquid Glass at your nearest automotive store or at a local Autozone. I will keep on buying this product as long as they make it. Mothers recommends using their Reflections carnauba wax before the top coat which I am sure is great I have yet to do this since I love the Liquid Glass so much. The appearance of your car will change dramatically especially if you have a dark car. I recommend before you apply this product make sure that the vehicle has been clayed to remove any contaminates before applying the topcoat. Hope this review has helped you in deciding whether this is a great product or not.

The filter on my son's car is on the side of the engine block (Nissan 240SX) and located right above a section of the frame that has holes in the top.  Every time I remove the filter, the oil drains out of the filter and enevitably into the frame (a big wad of shop rags or towels under the filter helps, but not always), then I've got oil draining from the frame for the next week, making a mess all over the driveway.  Anyway, the pump thing with the drain tube running from the pan is unique, but not what I bought the kit for (I only used the filter relocator).  Was impressed with the quality of the fittings and the hoses and everything hooked up like they said it would.  The big plus though.....  it's about one third the cost of any other kit out there (including those listed on Amazon.com)and it comes with adapters to fit just about any car.  Been on the car now for about 8 months with no problems and has made changing the filter sooooo much easier and cleaner....... in fact decided to buy another kit from Amazon for my own car"

Meguiar's NXT Tech is by far the best wax I have ever used. It leaves a tremendous deep shine and gloss. Keep in mind it is a wax, so it is essential for the best results to use a cleaner polish before applying the NXT. If the surface is clean you could get by with just the wax. I find that it lasts a long time in fact on one of our cars it lasted an entire year and the car sits outside. The key of course is to wash often, once a week is preferable. It leaves minimal residue which can easily be dealt with using a soft tooth brush to get out the excess wax. Every year I strip the wax off our cars and reapply polish and the wax. My 2000 still looks brand new and our other cars as well. I am sold on this product. Give it try and see for yourself. It also smells nice"

They both give the same look, but the paste seems to last longer, because liquid have more solvants in them. The paste is not hard to use at all, and the secret is to ues a very Small amount. If you try caking it on, you will have a hard time getting it off, and you will end up with streaks. I have a silver frost Lincoln Town car, and the NXT brings out the metal flake in the paint. The car looks as good as it did when it was new, and it is currently three years old. The cost is a littie on the high side, but don't forget, if you want the best look, and protection, it wil cost you a little more.

I had my doubts when I bought it. I lost an upholstered chair on the Washington, DC Beltway once -- tied it down with rope and it took off like a kite. But this Highland carrier did the job. When putting it together, save yourself some aggravation and loop the straps through the plastic bases BEFORE you attach the bases to the crossbars (the instructions tell you to do the reverse, which makes the threading next to impossible). The pieces attached firmly to the roof of my Camry, with flat metal hooks going on the sills of the open doors. Once the doors are closed there's no way the hooks can come out. Make sure the straps are tight before you close the doors. This can be a little tricky as there seemed to be some slippage through the buckles, but with a little tugging and wiggling they snugged up pretty well. Note that the rubber feet that fit on the plastic bases provide grip and protect your roof when the carrier is on, but they fall off easily when it's not in use. I don't know why they weren't permenently attached. The maximum recommended load is 150 pounds but I didn't test it to the limit -- the crossbars look sturdy but they're hollow metal tubes, and they bounced a little under the weight of the box. Also, the bars have a textured finish but seemed a little slippery, so I wrapped some gritty no-slip tape around them (the kind used on stairsteps) to prevent any slippage. I attached the box to the carrier with two ratchet tie-downs (highly recommended over rope). The tie-down straps were looped once around the box and under each crossbar and the box didn't budge the whole trip home. One other thing, make sure to tie up any dangling straps -- the sound of them whacking against the roof of your car can be very disconcerting. An inexpensive solution that's good for temporary use with light loads on short trips in cars that don't have roof racks.     

Update: Used the carrier to haul two of the same box on the Camry, bringing the load right up to the 150-lb maximum -- rock solid all the way. I laid the long boxes side-by-side with the longest width down to spread out the weight as much as possible, then duct-taped them together and fastened them down good and tight with tie-downs and rope (Overkill? perhaps, but better safe than sorry and sued.) My next car will probably be a small SUV, but until then I'm glad I have this carrier. Inexpensive, easy to use and remove and does the job"

I purchased this as the second replacement for a Toyota 4Runner. The compressors tend to rust since they are exposed to water kicked up from roads. This compressor looks better sealed, so that might make it last longer. Most Japanese cars come with weak horns, and this set makes up for them. They tend to scare the unwary (a good thing). The installation is straight-forward, but does require connecting electrical wires and mounting the relay, compressor and horns. To keep it simple, I tapped off the existing horn wire, ran a ground wire to an existing screw and used existing holes in the body panels"

Parisi ""Heather & Robert Parisi""","Pekin, IN USA","IN A NUTSHELL: 

WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN IT'S RAINING & YOUR TIRE GOES FLAT IN WAL-MART'S PARKING LOT?

This happened to me today and I was scared out of my wits. I had an hour to get home before my six-year-old son got off the school bus. I was 25 miles away and I just saw my rear tire and knew it had no air in it. I recalled using this product about 6 years ago and that it worked, so I ran into Wal-Mart and skipped the items I had come shopping for and went straight to the automotive section to hunt for this stuff. Twenty minutes later, standing in the parking lot, I read the directions and realized that I had to try to find what was leaking and remove it if possible. After breaking a small screwdriver and bending a key for a car we sold 5 years ago, I managed to remove a nail that was about 4 inches long -- the trouble was that the rest of the air leaked out rather quickly once I pulled out the nail. 

READ AND FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!

The directions on the can stated that the valve stem had to be in the 8 o'clock position so I had my teenage daughter back the car up until the valve stem was at the 8 o'clock position. I shook the can for over 30 seconds as Angela timed me, then I screwed the hose attachment into the valve stem. It whooshed as a stream of white, foamy liquid rushed through the transparent tubing into the tire. I could hear air rushing in with it but then I recalled what had actually happened the last time I used this stuff about 6 years ago. 

You guessed it, the hole was towards the top of the tire and the foam never got there allowing the air to simply escape very nosily out the hole. Since the flat was in the rear of my front-drive Plymouth Voyager Minivan, I drove it to a gas station that I knew had air, about 6 miles away. I went about 25 mph and many people hailed me as they drove alongside to inform me that I had a flat tire.

BUT THEN SOMETHING GOOD HAPPENED

By the time I reached the Chevron Station with the air, still some 20 miles from our home, I was convinced that I had turned the flat tire into spaghetti and that we would miss the bus. Well, I am happy to report that this was not the case. From traveling slowly, the tire had circulated that white sealant foam and had heated up some due to the extra friction caused by running without air. I filled the tire up and to my surprise there was no sound of escaping air. The sealant held and I drove, at a somewhat reduced speed, the remaining 18-20 miles in about 38 minutes to get home about 2 minutes ahead of the bus.

BOTTOM LINE: HAVE AN AIR SOURCE NEARBY IF YOU PULL OUT THE NAIL

This stuff does work, but after you pull out a nail from your tire it may be rather difficult to get it to hold the air before it can circulate and heat up within the tire. This was my actual experience with this exact product today, and it is consistent with what happened 6 years ago. In short, have an air supply lined-up when you insert the sealant as close as possible to where you remove the nail and insert the sealant. This will reduce the risk of running the tire flat and rendering it unserviceable. If you do this, you stand an excellent chance of executing a fast emergency repair that anybody can manage and, like me, you too might save the day.

Miller ""Zxtool""","Southeast, MI USA","I probably went through 5 different ""suction cup"" mounted compasses and none of them worked properly.  There are too many magnetic fields in a vehicle for them to work properly without calibration.

This compass however worked great within 5 minutes.

Installation is easy enough, and once it's mounted all you need to do is hold the button down for 5 seconds to put the compass in ""calibration"" mode, then drive around in circles slowly until it stops flashing.

Granted, you do look like an idiot driving in a circle in a parking lot somewhere, but once you are done the compass works just like one that you would find factory installed.

The only complaints are that the actual sensor feels kinda cheap and it came apart slightly when I was mounting it.  It just snapped back together though.  Also, the back light just stays on for 3 seconds.  I'd rather have it stay on for 10, but you need to think how long it really takes you to read two letters?

If you actually want a compass for your car and it didn't come with one, this is the only one I've found that actually works.

So just buy it.  :"

Mintu,,"I'm a big fan of the high-end Flukes so I've worked with the best. Well, these defintitely aren't the best, but you can't beat what you get for the price. I got it for my brother for his car and it does the job well.

First, the bad:
1. No auto shut-off. You gotta make sure you turn it off or the battery will just keep draining away.
2. No auto-sensing. You gotta set the dial for the range you're looking for. But hey, I like it so much I don't care that I can't be so lazy.

And the good:
1. All the features. You get all the standards PLUS a tach and a dwell-meter! That'll about cover your carbureted cars.
2. Price. You can find multimeters that can't do the extras for the same price and even more. Great bargain.
3. Alligator clips. Simple things but it'd be a pain without them.

Plus, this thing will handle all the home electrical work.

As for the rest: I won't vouch for its durability but Actron is a decent company. They go towards affordable but not junky. The case is made of a light plastic, but it doesn't seem fragile. As for the tolerances, they're not bad:

It is easy to use and the instruction manual that comes with it tells you how to perform most common tests that it does with pictures to go along. There are comperable multi-meters out there that cost less but most would cost more. There are certainly better multi-meters than this one but they will cost more. The only bad things I can say about this tool is that the battery is hard to get to. You have to remove 2 screws in the back and pry it apart. Actron should have just put one of those slide off battery covers on it. Also most multi-meters come with some sort of rubber, protective sleeve, that also has a lanyard for your hand so you dont drop it. If this mult-meter had a lanyard and the battery was easier to get out, I would have given it a 5 Stars."

Don't expect this tool to tell you exactly what went bad and what part to replace. You need to have a working knowledge of automotive mechanics, and a service manual of the vehicle is a great help (almost a must). This tool will steer you in the right direction.
  Example; My car's transmission quit dead in the road without any prior warning. Do I take it to a dealer and spend much $$$ $2400 or so for a rebuild? Not yet. My scanner said ""Gears #1,2,3,4 had the wrong gear ratio.""  Huh wot??  Well, after examining my service manual,I determined that a sensor that measures input and output speeds must be bad. I bought the sensor for $16.50 and fixed it. By the way, I'm not an auto mechanic. I'm a diemaker"

That is, until I put Silblades on. The first time I ran into such a rain, I realized that much of what I had previously thought was ""out there"" was really right on my windshield, a result of inferior blades that simply could not keep up with the amount of water landing on the windshield. Like inferior tires, all of my previous blades (and yours, I'll bet) had effectively been 'aquaplaning' over my windshield, leaving a layer of water that was all but impossible to see through. It took Silbades to show me that a superior blade could improve the visibility through my windshield in 'blinding' rainstorms by 75% or more. For once I could see more than a blur in front of me as I drove the speed you have to in order to avoid getting rear-ended by other blinded drivers.  "

I wanted some good replacement windshield wiper blades for the Bosch blades I had (they were about a year and a half old and weren't holding out well). I did my research and decided to look into silicon rubber blades after reading so much about them. I was first going to get the PIAA brand, however the price and five year warranty the Silblades offered changed my mind. I haven't looked back since. 

One of the things I hated about my old blades is they ended up making a lot of noise when sliding against the windshield unless there was a decent amount of water pouring down. From the first day I installed these onto my car and that first rain drizzle came down I was sold. The blades are whisper quiet, even with just a little moisture on the glass. You literally won't hear them. Heck, they are quiet even if you have no water on the glass. All you will hear is the motors that turn the blades. My old Bosche blades weren't anywhere near that quiet, even right out of the box. 

The Silblades seem to work really well in getting the water off the windshield too. I dare say better than any other blades I have used. Some other blades I had would sometimes leave a thin trail of water still on the glass, but not the Silblades. Everything wipes clean from the blade's path. Also it's true what they say about the silicone in the rubber leaving a protective coating. The rain on your windshield will start to bead just like after waxing your car. I can't say it happened immediately because... well my windshield was waxed the day before I installed the blades. However the beading has lasting much, much longer than it should have from waxing alone. 

I live in Houston, TX so I'm love how these blades hold up against the searing heat. No cracks yet or even color fading. I can't tell you how well they do in snow and ice since we don't get much of either here, and I haven't travelled anywhere to test the blades on that yet. However I don't doubt the manufacturer's claims on standing up to the bitter cold. 

The PIAA silicone blades claimed they could do all of these things too. However they were $25 per blade and were only guaranteed to work a year. The Silblades have a five year warranty and the price can't be beat. If you really, REALLY want a noticeable difference in our windshield wiping experience then I suggest you grab these for your own vehicle. You will thank me for it."

My car was covered with a stubborn deposit of dirt and grime that simply would not come off with a car wash. It seemed that the dirt and grime had gotten lodged in the paint and wouldn't budge no matter how hard I tried washing the car. After every car wash, I would run my fingers through the paint and it would still feel gritty.

That was when I learned about Mothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System Kit. The results were astounding! After using it, the paint no longer felt gritty but glassy-smooth. The paint was no longer dulled by contaminants and the car looked like it has a new coat of paint! I was immensely pleased with the results.

Unlike a lot of car polish or polishing compounds that use abrasion to strip away surface contaminants, auto clay simply picks up surface contaminants and locks them into the clay. The clay looks and feels exactly like plasticine (Play-dohÂ®) and it is used along with the included ""lubricant"" spray (actually, an auto soap that provide lots of suds -- like Meguiar's Gold Class -- will work equally well.)

Mind you, car polish still has its place in paint restoration because claying will not remove scratches; only a car polish or a polishing compound (harsher) can do that. And remember, always follow the claying with an application of wax to shield your paint from new contaminants. Also, clay your car every so often and you will keep the paint looking like new!

I am giving Mothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System Kit my highest recommendation. Go on, try it and see for yourself firsthand the difference it makes in your car paint. It's worth every penny and I'm sure you'll be glad you did!"
