So then I used it about 6 months later to detail a neighbors car and it left SCUM EVERYWHERE!  This wasn't your ordinary scum, this stuff was hard to get off the car.  I spent a solid day scrubing the car to get this SCUM off the car.  So I swore I wouldn't use it after all that happend.  So today I decided to wash my car because I'm moving to Arizona in a day.  I used the power washer with a new bottle of Mr. Clean soap. I mean hey...what would go wrong....MORE OF THAT SCUM, so here I am now spending my day rubbing the scum off at least the windows instead of packing up the car...anyway you all know my feelings on this product.

I was looking for carwash detergent at Safeway, and the Mr. Clean AutoDry was on sale.  Curious, I gave it a try.

First of all, this unit wastes a LOT of water.  After washing and rinsing, you have to apply filtered water all over the car from a distance of one feet.  It feels like spray painting.

Then you wait for the water to evaporate.  Problem is, I live in San Franisco, CA -- nothing dries in this climate without help.  If I hadn't hand dried my car, I'd still be waiting for the water to evaporate.

Another odd thing -- hand drying actually seemed more difficult after using the Mr. Clean soap and unit.  It's as though it left a residue.  I'm not sure what it is.

But I'll probably end up washing my car again tomorrow, the old-fashioned way .."

The reading drops several psi while bleeding just as with a mechanical dial gauge.  The reading takes about two seconds to re-stabilize, so a mechanical gauge is actually faster to use.

The quick-connector on the end of the hose is excellent, but be careful to not scratch the wheel with it.  The hose is fairly stiff, but isn't a problem most of the time.

I used this gauge at the track this past weekend, and was pleased with it until the second morning when it was cold (by cold I mean 45F, this is Houston...) and the display read 'Lo', indicating a low battery.  So essentially the gauge was useless.  The hose also becomes annoyingly stiff when cold.

Overall, a good mechanical gauge is easier to use and more reliable, as long as you don't drop it"

Stimson,"Sunnyvale, CA USA","I had the same problem described by R. Nielsen.  The gauge would not take a new reading after I pressed the release valve to let air out.  It only took a new reading if it was removed from the tire completely and reconnected.  I called the manufacturer, who told me that it sounded like a problem and that I should return the gauge to them for a replacement.  I returned it to Amazon as defective and got a new one with the same problem.  I contacted the manufacturer again and they again asked me to send the gauge in for a replacement.  I have sent the gauge to the manufacturer at my expense.  The second replacement also had the problem.  Customer service told me that they had sent the second replacement from the wrong batch/crate.

Six weeks later (November 27th) I received a properly functioning gauge.  So it seems that a properly manufactured example of this gauge really does work properly.  There was just a very large run of defective ones.  At this point, I would give this item 3 stars: 4 for performance and price, minus one for the hassle involved in getting one that isn't defective.

If yours is defective, you should contact Accutire customer service and let them know: 973-402-4240."

Oh yes, and it doesn't do anything other than spin a joke fan that couldn't move a feather. I put my hand in front of it and felt nothing - no wonder my car still feels like an oven. We can't drive off with it on, as the wind noise is unbearable even after unhooking the unit. Why? Because of the 'sealing' rubber strip you've hooked over the top of the glass leaving a nice 4mm gap for the wind.
I thought I was smart going on ebay and buying two for the price of one. I would have been smarter spending the money on lottery tickets"

Sure - it says ""New Car Scent"", and it has a picture of a car and a nice ribbon and everything - but I would definitely not use this stuff in my car.  First of all, it doesn't smell anything like the interior of a new car, and inhaling this stuff in that small an area would be lethal, even if you drive a Hummer.  It is super-concentrated, and a one second blast is enough to saturate a 10 ft x 10 ft room with an unpleasant chemical smell, which might just be able to eliminate you and yours along with the airborne bacteria, smoke and odors.
 
I can't vouch for any of the claims of air cleansing, sanitizing, bacteria reduction or removal of smoke and odors, because after the first test spray (in my office on a Friday afternoon) I vacated the premises under duress, and by Monday morning it had thankfully dissipated.  I've never used it again, and even though it may conceivably be the best airborne germ killing thing-gummy ever invented, the smell makes it impossible to use in the presence of living, breathing people.
 
To be fair, the write-up never actually states that it is for cars, instead listing schools, medical facilities and food-processing areas, but then why on earth would you want any of these places to smell like a new car?  And why would you need a one ounce bottle of product for your factory?  The claims of deodorizing and leaving a fresh fragrance certainly didn't happen for me, and unless you come from somewhere where the pollution smells worse than this, I couldn't recommend it.

the straps for the 'net' are extremely unmanageable and there are several key elements missing from the instructions.  having never used a roof top cargo bag before, this presented quite an obstacle for me.  there are loops through which you send the straps for the net that holds the bag down, the instructions make no mention of them, do you loop the strap through before or after you loop it through the luggage rack?  does it make a difference?  it took me 45 minutes just to get the thing attached to my roof due to trial and error (not counting loading time).
the clips themselves are very poor construction, one of them broke upon tightening and had to be makeshift tied instead.
the straps also do not tighten very easily, you have to feed the straps through the clips and then keep moving the clips back and forth until you get it to the length you want.
the stitching also started ripping when trying to close the very stubborn zipper.  the bag was not overstuffed.

I have not received a new pump. I cannot get a response from telephone message requests at (303) 629 7700. Almost a month now. Yuk! Paul

I purchased the HV30 Portable Compressor because it promised rapid inflation of tires and blowup toys. The 140 pound pressure limit was certainly adequate. The price was right.

The Compressor comes with a hose that screws onto the compressor on one end and screws onto the tire valve stem on the other end. The compressor end thread was damaged. I had to use a pliers to tighten what should have been a hand tightened connection. Because the tire end screws on, air is lost as it is unscrewed after the tire is inflated. Most tire inflators come with a quick disconnect. Further, the compressor won't start against tire pressure if the connector hose is screwed on the tire valve. I had to start the compressor and then screw the hose onto the valve stem.

I haven't tried inflating a bike tire yet. I strongly suspect the air lost during unscrewing the connector hose will almost deflate the tire. This is just a great idea for inflating tires much faster than with pumps designed for much higher pressure limits but really poor engineering execution"

Luckily the rubbing compound got the stain off. After this I dumped the tube in our basement and lost track of it since then (Probably dumped it). Shortly after we went to the auto store again and we found auto paint. They come in a little tube with a paint brush and each paint has a code (got to get the one for your model car). Used it worked well and years later still looks good.

 Up close you can still see a scratch was there but only really up close. After that I waxed the area after the paint dried and it looked fine. Unless you look for it you will not see a scratch.

Take a look at this review from Channel 2 (KDKA) in Pittsburgh, PA:

You've probably seen the ad on TV for auto cool - it's supposed to keep your parked car cooler.

But does it really do that? 

Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to keep your parked car cool?

Diane Black knows all too well the misery of climbing into a hot car. 

""I am a visiting nurse. I'm in and out of the car all day,"" Black said. ""I hate using the air conditioning because it uses up all my gas. So I thought this little gadget for $14.99 would be the perfect thing.""

After shipping and handling, $23 for Auto Cool as seen on TV. 

The same sun that makes your car unbearably hot will keep it cool and comfortable thanks to a solar powered fan that blows the hot air out of your parked car. 

But does it really do that?

On a hot day last week, we decided to find out. Inside the Auto Cool box, we get our solar powered fan and some weather stripping.

The only thing you need is a pair of scissors.

Now they tell you to check either the front or back window - whichever is getting the most sun.

We choose the back window and we're going to put the window down four or five inches.

The solar powered fan starts working the second the sun's rays hit it. No problem there. We hang it on the window, fan side in.

Next comes the weather stripping.

So we've installed Auto Cool. Now we are going to go inside, wait about an hour and check it and see if it's any less than 110 degrees.

While we are away, the thermometer slowly moves - in the wrong direction.

One hour later, it's 118 degrees inside that car.

We are stunned that auto cool didn't work at all. It just got hotter inside. 

But just to be fair, we test one more car.

We make sure to start off the car is relatively cool. This time, it's 80 degrees.

We quickly install auto cool. By now, the temperature is 90 degrees. 

While Diane is off doing hers, a patient visits. She says it will take about 20 minutes. 

In the meantime, that solar powered fan is working we can even feel the hot air blowing out of the car.

Will it work this time? 

Twenty minutes later - it's 110 degrees.

Maybe if we hadn't used Auto Cool, our car would have been 111 degrees instead of 110, but that high up, we don't care. 

Not only does it not do that, this is the worst product we've tested so far.

Don't waste your money on this one. "

""No problem"" thinks I, ""I do believe I have been carrying a solution to this very problem right here in the trunk!"".  Open the trunk, pull out the ""Fix a Flat"" (HA!) only to find it FROZEN SOLID.  Now, what use does something like this have, whereby you keep it in your car for an emergency only to have it completely useless when you need it most!?  Cost me time + $ to put on my spare, haul it to a shop, and have my tire repaired.  This stuff was a waste of money.
